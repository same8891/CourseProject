Glad we did. The food was freshly made and had a great taste.
We ordered a Portillo’s Beef Hot Dog (Reg Size) with all the toppings along with a Maxwell Street Polish. Both had great flavor and did not disappoint. I also ordered a small fries along with a Garden Salad. The side Salad is pretty large and is served with a pretty large piece of Ciabatta Bread. My daughter and son-in-law split a Beef Hot Dog and an Italian Beef Sandwich. She said it was really tasty. If you want a good quick meal visit Portillo’s!!",1
1,"I really liked this place. There are really long lines, but very quick. I was waiting on the order for a couple of minutes, but hotdogs only. Those were ready before I ordered a beer :) also, they serve a beer in an ice-cold glass! Awesome! A lot of space, 2 floors, easy to find a table. Definitely recommend if you never tried Chicago-style hot dog 🌭!",1
2,"The seasonal salted caramel shake was delicious! The hot dog was something I have never experienced with all the different veggies and specialty peppers. The hot dog itself did not seem to have you to have a lot of flavor but all the toppings made up for it. The sandwich was a little dry however they did have a gravy option maybe that's where we went wrong in ordering it dry but the meat was tender. Bathrooms were clean, employees constantly walking around keeping the tables clean.",1
3,"This is one of those places you are told to go to while in Chicago.  The food was great.  The hot Italian beef sandwich, hot dogs and chocolate cake are all amazing.  The line was pretty long for around 3 in the afternoon, but that is expected.  The main reason that I gave them four stars is the state of the bathrooms and general lack of cleaning.  They had a few employees walking around to clean, but they obviously needed more.  I am hoping that this was just a one off situation.  Overall, I would go back, since the food was very good.",1
4,"The chocolate cake was my absolute favorite dessert of all time. It was so moist and not too sweet on the frosting. Absolutely divine!!! The hotdog was also excellent, I wish the peppers were a little more spicy but they had a kick. The restaurant itself was very cozy, lots of seating and things to look at. The staff could be a little bit more friendlier but what else do you expect from Chicago.",1
5,"Very popular, casual, neighborhood restaurant on N Clark & W Ontario. You can walk in, place your order and pick it up within minutes.  I was surprised  by the spacious food court feel when I walked in.  But way cooler.  Service was quick and we enjoyed our first classic Chicago style beef hot dogs. It hit the spot. We had a side of onion rings too.",1
6,"One of the best hot dogs I have ever had! Beef sandwich, even with extra gravy was a bit dry but also pretty good. Atmosphere was awesome! The shakes are to die for!",1
7,"Food was great, truly a taste  of Chicago. The ambience of the restaurant captured the old style Chicago. Toilets weren't the best. While we were about to eat and we needed to combine 2 tables because we were 7 in total. We wanted to enjoy our meal and experience as a family. Until this service lady came to us and told us to rearrange back the tables after we ate. Paying customers rearranging back tables? It was past lunch and there was not enough customers to make her job busy. But NO she had to come to us and make us feel uncomfortable. Like she was the one paying for our meal. She was rude and management should look unto this kind of customer service. 2 stars for the bad and rude customer service!",0
8,"Cool building, large eat-in cafeteria style. Wait in line, order food, wait for food and sit. It was a pretty long wait, even one of the employees behind the counter agreed. We also got the popular cake shakes, they tasted like they sound...crumbled up cake in a shake. Nothing to rave about but not bad either. I got the Baked Mostaccioli and it was delicious! Another in my party got the Italian Beef Sandwich and wasn't impressed. Not terrible, but not great either.  I'd go again, but not sure why all the hype.",1
9,"Came to this place cause it’s pretty famous according to other reviews, although I have seen a few things that made me feel I should say that if you visit this place, it should be for the sandwiches or hot dogs; the salad ingredients did not look fresh and one of the workers was leaning in the food counter facing her co-worker and shaking her hair on the food, she had gloves on but was not practicing the cross contamination process, hopefully she gets better training. Usually I don’t like to complain about things like this but seeing this really bugged me, I hope no-one gets sick cause it’s a very busy restaurant… now on the good side of the story the steak sandwich was not disappointing, if you like juicy sandwiches order it with the gravy. I wish I could give it the 5 star rating but I deducted one because of the salad bar.",1
10,"Had a bad time here- my party wanted to go because it’s so highly lauded, but because I’m vegan and was asking what kind of veggie sandwich I could get since I was told they had something they made for people with my preference, the cashiers were genuinely apathetic and unhelpful. One of the only times I walked out of a line for food because of the service I received. This place is to me, smoke and mirrors and is about as decent as a fast food joint. If the atmosphere is supposed to be so great, don’t think to hard about the staff or service because they’ll take that good taste right out of your mouth.",0
11,It was alrighty. Not what I expected. The hot dogs was just a regular  hot dog that you buy at the supermarket. The pasta was pretty good. The restaurant is very busy. There was only one register working which made the line huge. There are different sections inside the restaurant depending on which type of food you want. Not impressed won't return,1
12,What appears as sheer chaos (ordering and getting your food) soon turns into a great tasting experience. The Chicago dog made with Vienna beef hotdogs is to die for. The Polish sausage was one of the tastiest I've ever eaten ...and the 'world famous' chocolate cake really should get that award if it doesn't already. One of the best places in Chicago to eat and something you shouldn't miss. Wish we had had more time to go back again!,1
13,Probably the best hotdogs I ever tasted!,1
14,I will forever come here for the Italian Beef Sandwich! One of my favorite stops!,1
15,Lived up to all the expectations and hype of must have Chicago food!,1
16,"Such a great Chicago treat, in a town full of expensive options, this is a great value. You have to get a Chicago dog in the Windy City and this is the place to get it!",1
17,"Good hotdogs, but didn't completely live up to the expectations. I first ordered the Portillo's hot dog, but when I received it, it was super soggy like it had been made 15 min prior. So much that it stuck to the wrapper and wouldn't come off ,so I requested a new one. They had no problem making me a fresh one. Much better, but not great. Will try a different place next time.",1
18,Yikes won't be eating here again. They served us uncooked fries and the beef sandwich was gross. I wish I would have looked in the bag before I got home I would have returned it right back to them. You would think they would notice they served us a 1/4 box of fries. I wanted to puke it was so gross.,0
19,"I don't want to say these hot dogs were the best food I ate in Chicago, but it was definitely up there. Get the Italian Beef Sandwich with extra peppers and extra gravy.",1
20,the food here was incredible I recommend the pasta it was incredible,1
21,They forgot ALL of our toppings on our burgers. We called them and they put us on hold for 20 minutes to get a manager. So we decided to just go to the store since Google said they closed at 12. When we got there they said they closed at 11 and that we needed to go through the drive through which was already packed. The employees were unhelpful and could be seen standing around through the drive through window. We did not get to speak to a single manager.,0
22,"Had Italian beef sandwich and Jumbo hotdog. Love them, especially the hotdog. Awesome food awesome price
Nice vibe and decorations for dine in
Pretty quick service",1
23,"This place is delicious! Come here for your traditional Chicago dogs, including polish dogs too. Their burgers are great too! And so are their fries and onion rings! They have upstairs seating too but it was closed off when I was there which was too bad cuz the bottom was pretty full, had to pounce on a table when we saw ppl start cleaning up. Lots of personalized signed photos from famous folks who have visited.",1
24,"BIG BEEF ALL DAY!!!!! This place went from waiting 20 minutes for food to 5 to 10 minutes. This place is improving year after year. The only thing I hate is the restrooms they are in a weird spot. When walking upstairs you get a hit of washroom smell in your face, but other than that 5 stars baby.",1
25,Fun kitschy atmosphere where you can get an authentic Chicago hot dog.,1
26,"I love this place. Delicious fast food. The hot dogs are amazing (I love the Chicago style one) and the burgers too.

The only thing they could improve is their system to take the orders. They have two lines and three cashiers, but two of them serve 1 line and one of them serve the other. Of course if you are in the one cashier line you'll have to wait forever to order your food.",1
27,"The atmosphere is incredible.  So much food is pumped out of this place but completely awesome! The staff, as busy as they are, were very friendly. I had to find out one particular person's name as she was so wonderful.  Her name was. ..Mama T! I watched her help so many folks that day. Great spirits!Food was great! That chocolate cake was a great treat back at out hotel!",1
28,This place has a carnival feel. It was busy when we visited around lunch on Friday. But the service was still fast. I had the Italian Beef with the dip on the side. The meat was tender and seasoned well though I think the bread with the dip is an aquired texture. A little to moist for me. Sorry about the M word. Over all I would return and try a few more things on the menu. The daiquiri was good.,1
29,"I had the Italian Beef and Sausage sandwich, a 8.8 score! Fantastic! Mom, Gabs, and Niko had Classic Hot Dogs and gave them high marks, 8.8 to 10! Fries are Devine, my Chocolate Shake was dreamy! Great atmosphere! Wonderful experience, will be back!",1
30,"Super friendly staff, was told to try out their hot dogs. It was definitely yummy! Great for a quick stop",1
31,"The food is really good, the atmosphere is crazy, fun. I've been to the one in Chicago's twice now and both times. Because of the way that the orders just come out so randomly, both times I've had to go inquire about my order. The first time it got lost in the shuffle. The second time only half of my order came out.
I really like the place and food as I said but I wondered if a more organized method wouldn't be more helpful.",1
32,"After all the hype, we got a soggy and semi cold dog and beef. Crowded. Loud. Sticky.  Had to hover to take over a table, overpriced for the portions.

I don’t get it.

EDIT: because my wife requested we try this again, I gave it another shot.

The absolute worst hot dog spot ever. Overpriced soggy nasty dogs. Waited 20 mins.",0
33,"Visiting Chicago for first time and was excited to try.  Food was good but if friendly efficient service matters to you...go elsewhere. Cashier took my money with not a hint of recognition she was speaking with another human (Made me wish for an ordering kiosk).  Numbers get called out completely based on how workers feel like getting the orders out?  My food and others food were thrown around a couple of times before getting into our hands.  But...after the wait and ordeal, the food was good.",1
34,Super delicious!!!,1
35,"Loved the beef hotdog! Nice combination of textures - crunchy pickle, squishy bun, juicy hotdog.",1
36,"Wow, foods great!  Decent prices too, for Chicago.",1
37,"THE authentic Chicago dog!! Get the Jumbo Dog- great dog, great value! Juicy, messy, crispy fresh toppings! Always busy but never a very long wait. Exceptional iconic food Chi-town flavor that takes two hands to eat! More than just dogs, too. Great old Chicago decor. Beer, wine, cocktails, Coke products!",1
38,"Very nice experience. I went on Saint Patricks, so it was full, as any other restaurant in town. It took a while to get my order, but the attendants were very efficient. The place itself looks nice, with a considerable amount of tables (you can go to the second floor). I had a hot dog and think it was quite different from the ones I had so far, and good, of course, so I recommend this place.",1
39,"The Italian beef sandwich with Italian sausage and peppers is delicious, what's even better than that is the delicious lemon cake shake. In Canada we dont have cake shakes so this was a pretty special moment for myself and my friend. The thickness, texture and flavour were perfect. This is definitely a place I'd visit again when I come back to Chicago.",1
40,"By far my favorite place to go when I'm craving Chicago food. Great location, amazing decor and great food. I recommend trying either the Italian beef, ribs, Maxwell hot dog and any of their burgers. You won't be disappointed. After your done and have any more room. You have hot to try the chocolate cake shake it's worth it.",1
41,"Good environment, good location, great food, great drinks. Whether you are a local, new to the area, or just visiting; this is a must go to.",1
42,Great hotdogs. The building was just as interesting.,1
43,Tried authentic Chicago style hotdogs. I thought they tasted pretty darn good,1
44,Had to try a Chicago dog while I was down here. Delicious! Onion rings were good too. Only thing was you order your food like a fast food place then have to find a table. We ended up eating outside.  Thank goodness it wasnt too cold!!,1
45,"We went at the worst possible time. Friday night, around 9pm...there were several events happening this weekend...we waited an hour for our food.  The lines were incredibly chaotic and poorly organized.  Staff isn’t terribly helpful or communicative...but we did get the best Chicago Dog around, it was amazing...with everything on it!!  We also got the drip beef sandwich and the chicken Parmesan...all delicious!  Just be ready to wait for it on the weekend at this time!!!",1
46,"Amazing atmosphere, food could be a bit better. I couldn't eat more than two spoonfuls of the chili, but the hot dog was amazing. Overall a good experience, would recommend. Plus: they have a signed Michael Jordan Bulls jersey! :)",1
47,"Make sure you know what you want when you get in line because this place moves fast. There is a lot of seating here and ultra kitschy decor. You can get almost anything from salad to hot dogs, sandwiches to Italian food. Make sure you order a chocolate cake shake because they are incredible and full of real cake. The large is huge though so be ready to share or just have the shake for a meal.",1
48,Food and service were amazing.  Chocolate cake shake was very good.,1
49,"Fantastic food, I had an italian beef with extra gravy and it was everything I wanted. They have free refills on soda and iced tea but they do not have a machine to do it yourself so you could get stuck waiting for a refill. Brought my family here and the staff was very friendly and helpful. As a tourist, this is a fantastic attraction and great place for reasonably priced food.",1
50,Chocolate cake shake 😋  was yummy...!!,1
51,Yummy! It was a good fast food to try,1
52,Classic hotdogs place with legit Chicago style dogs. Great place to bring families and friends and where you can grab something good and cheap to eat. There are so many options for everyone and with plentiful seating. Grab the Chicago style hot dog and the classic beef sandwich (get it dipped!). Happy eats!,1
53,"I loved it, best food ever. They have a great and large menu, I hot 4 different hot dogs and they were the best hot dogs ever. I traveled from SC and prior to going to Chicago everyone told me I needed to try Portillo's and they were right. I strongly recommend it and I am looking forward to going back next time and in town.",1
54,"For being a popular, well known place, the food really lives up to the hype. They nail the execution of the Chicago hot dog. The hot dog is delicious, the toppings are fresh and the poppy seed bun just completes this chicago staple! I will definitely be back during my next trip!",1
55,"Atmosphere was cool, I liked the old feel of it, huge problem was the waiting, the place seemed super inefficient. Was waiting for simple hot dog, fries and a shake for almost an hour. The hot dog was really soggy probably from sitting around.  There was several drinks sitting around and no one was trying to figure out who the drinks belong to. The pasta that I tried was alright.",0
56,"Very good experience, was concerned about trying the famous Chicago hotdog but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  The Italian beef sandwich was delicious too",1
57,"A true Chicago eating institution. Roll up your sleeves and dig in. Service is hectic but very efficient. The whole menu is tempting, and you can't go wrong with whatever you order. Even the salad bread is delicious. Great atmosphere too. I""m just glad I don't live here, cuz I'd be there every day.",1
58,We had a family reunion (30people) in Chicago and our first nights dinner was at Portillo's. Mama T and Wes were the absolute best. They gave us an experience we will never forget!!! Food was delicious. Chocolate cake amazing. Thank you so much for making this trip a perfect memory.,1
59,"Portillo's has never disappointed me. Fast service and delicious food, you won't be disappointed!",1
60,"The Italian beef sandwiches ordered were  the  dry sandwich with gravy on the side. They were scrumptious! So tasty  they were as was the whole rack of pork ribs and Greek salad with chicken. Only thing is that you have to be patient during the dinner hour rush at abt 6:30 PM, but well worth the wait!!",1
61,"The line was ridiculous the hot dog and chocolate cake was delicious. They had no problem taking our money via one if 3 cashier lines. We waited an hour and 30 minutes for a really simple order. We even got our chocolate cake fron the bar faster. Despite standing so long my feet hurt, here I am the next day contemplating the 15 minute walk back to nab another dog while my husband sleeps in on our last full day in Chicago.",1
62,"While they are stating that the work hours is up to 12 AM in the google page, we got there around 11:15 and they were closed.
I told them to change the hours at least to not mislead people, but the lady over there was so rude and not even looked at me.
I haven’t tried the food but I bet the customer service is zero.",0
63,Great tasting Italian Beef. Very friendly staff. We always try to eat here if traveling through the area.,1
64,Very overrated! Waited 1 hour for food that wasn’t even good. I had the Italian beef and my wife had the chili cheese dog both were subpar. Staff was also rude.,0
65,It's a Chicago hot dog stand. Large menu . The cheese burger could use a more substantial bun. It disinigrates before you get half way through.,1
66,"Love this place. It's noisey, but the food is always good. You can always see employees in the dining room cleaning. I recommend the Italian beef with peppers and cheese, with extra gravy. The burgers, hot dogs, and ribs are also great. There is no table service so pay attention when the call your order number.",1
67,"Worst location ever, they literally take your order and do the exact opposite of what you ask 😂 get it together.",0
68,"I placed an order for delivery and did not receive the cheeseburger, and chicken sandwich I ordered. We ordered a small group salad and received no salad dressing. For the Italian beefs, I ordered gravy on the side and did not receive this. I have a large family and did not receive all the items I ordered. I spent $150 on food and was extremely upset I did not receive all my items. When I contacted the store after I received my incomplete order, I waited on hold to speak to a manager for over 30 minutes. This is unacceptable and I am very disappointed in the service.",0
69,"The place itself was very cool. Lots of tasteful decorations. However, the fact that the place looked nice doesn't change the fact that they cant get an order right. I asked for a ""normal hot dog with nothing on it.""
They charged me over 3 dollars for a hot dog covered in relish, peppers, and a pickle on top. They also round their dollar, so my 5.51$ meal became 6$. Not very reasonable. Service was very frantic and unorganized.",0
70,The line to order was long but the food was made fast. The Chicago style hot dog was delicious. Cheese fries was just regular nacho cheese. The chocolate cake was moist and good but not amazing like everybody was telling us.,1
71,I have been waiting for years to get to Chicago for a hot dog! Portillo's did not disappoint. Both the hot dog and the Maxwell Street Polish Sausage were incredible; almost brought tears of joy to my eyes. The atmosphere is very fun and lends itself to the whole experience.,1
72,"Cold, late, missing a meatball sub.  So your location messed up and Uber Eats is pathetic!  I'm literally watching the driver make other stops but I paid for direct delivery.  I know you can't control this part of it but your food arrived late, way late, almost an hour in the car, missing an item, and in poor condition,  it does reflect on your store.",0
73,"Really some of the best hot dogs in Chicago.  Expect a wait, a they are very popular.  But, they are also good at getting people through the line quickly.  Try the neon green relish!  It is fantastic.

Additionally, their Italian sandwich is really good.  Try THAT one with hot peppers!",1
74,Regret i only had one hot dog there. It was sosososso good!,1
75,"Fast food place, as to be expected. Food is made to order. The process is very hectic, from order, to listening to pick up your order. They need a better process, people like to crowd the counter and it is hard to retrieve your order. Otherwise the food is as good as you would expect a fast food joint. But the chocolate cake shake is a must along with the cheese fries. Could eat those for every meal.",1
76,Great place for Chicago style dogs of course! There is usually a bit of a line but the employees are super efficient and the good food is usually worth the wait. If you aren't super into meat they offer salads and some other veggie options as well.,1
77,"I think this place is overrated.

The bread of the hot dog is too soft. The pickled peppers are good.

The Italian beef sandwich literally only has beef in it. It can be too boring to just eat that. The hot dog has more flavors.

Order online to save waiting.",1
78,Fun place! It was very busy and the staff handled it wonderfully. The tamale and hotdog were amazing!,1
79,"Awesome dogs, but don't be fooled.   They have LOTS of other great options as well.  Price right, convenience,  historical environment!!  Great family style diners!!",1
80,"One of a must eat food while in Chicago is the famous hot dog, and this place has it. It tasted good, considered cheap, but the size was relatively small. The dining place was fantastic, well decorated with a distinct American theme, and lots of seat, so not worry for a long line because the serving speed was fast.",1
81,"Very busy and waited a long time for our food. Just be aware that there are 2 different serving lines depending on what you ordered and their PA system is needing an upgrade so you probably won't hear your number called. Food was good but small portions. I can say I experienced it, but have no desire of going back.",0
82,"Visited this location 3 separate times while visiting the River North area.
The food here is good, the best item on the menu is the combo beef and grilled sausage sandwich, the hot dog is really nothing special and the fries are decent.
My biggest issue with this place is how they handle your order since it can be confusing to first time visitors.  There are multiple stations to pick-up your food and while one item may be ready and called, other items on the order, like a salad are not ready and need to picked up at a different counter.  of course they don't tell you this when you order and when you question about the missing item they treat you rudely.  customer service here is really lacking, i guess they don't think they need to be nice to customers since they are so busy.",1
83,"Must try,  Italian beef sandwich was great and very reasonably price",1
84,"As someone who grew up going to Portillo's in the suburbs, I still find myself drawn to it in the city, despite the many, MANY other options. It's all just okay, and occasionally they make the fries just as I remember. Overall, this particular location is just almost always busy, and the drive thru can feel a bit intimidating if you've never been; forced to give your order before you can see the menu (yes, I'm that person who must see a menu even if there's a 99% chance I'll order the same thing). But it's run like a well-oiled machine.

If you're looking for nostalgia, come here. If you're looking for something more closer to the real Chicago feel, I think Wiener Circle is the, umm, wiener. :)",1
85,Service was quick and the food was delicious. Definitely an interesting place to stop while visiting Chicago!,1
86,Their new spicy chicken sandwich is great. Awesome service inside too!,1
87,"Meh. Chicago dogs are definitely not something Chicago natives eat -- and nobody else should either. Went to order a beer and they had to get someone who ""was off"" to pour the thing. Really really meh.

Seems popular.. I dunno why.",1
88,"They ARE the best chili cheese dogs in Chicago!  Staff was fast, professional and courteous. We'll be back soon!",1
89,"We went for lunch and all I can say is: great food, great service, great atmosphere and great energy.  The Chicago Dawgs were perfect, the onion rings outstanding and the shakes super creamy.  The salad was also good but the lettuce was cut way too small.  Everything looked and tasted great, we will be back. A must for any Chicago visit.  BE PREPARED TO WAIT 15 - 20 MIN FOR YOUR FOOD.",1
90,"Heard great things about the hot dogs. Cashier was great and friendly. The rest of the service was horrible.  We ended up getting a refund. The girls at the salad bar had horrible service
Sunday evening, 25th order 81",0
91,"Good old Chicago food - my favourite go to is the Italian beef (SO GOOD) and onion rings (full onion slices, not minced). Plus, their chocolate cake?? *chef's kiss*",1
92,Great polish dogs and nice chill vibes inside,1
93,"Emma directed me to this spot. She remembered Portillo from a much earlier visit to the Windy City. Meety dogs and sausages

Try at least once if in Chicago.",1
94,"Do not order online from this location. They use Doordash and the restaurant employee said “yeah, they’re really bad, you shouldn’t use them.” But if you order through their website you don’t have a choice, very confused by this. Clearly the restaurant and the HQ Ops couldn’t be further removed from each other. Incompetent customer service on backend from Portillo’s Guest Service team - Lindsay is useless.

Further, their customer service line does not work (out of service 7/2-7/6 but still not back online as of 7/13??), and good luck getting through to the restaurant on the phone.",0
95,"Spaghetti and meatballs at Portillo's is delicious!
Also I liked that they ask to see your covid test card if you are dining in",1
96,"Delicious hot dogs. The menu includes many others things, But the hot dogs are the best",1
97,Never got order on time. Very rude employees,0
98,Chocolate cake shake was okay. The beef hot dog was not good.,1
99,"Was told to try it by a local cabbie, good call on his part. Food was great. We had both hot dogs and pasta. I ate it too quick to get a pic. Other than the long line of people ordering, and one rude a**hole yelling at the employees, it was a great place to chow. Kids loved it, wife loved it. Spot on. Worth the wait if they are busy! *now a must stop for us when we come to Chi-City* Get there and get some for yourself!! Enjoy!! 😀",1
100,"We ate here during the Fourth of July holidays. We had various hotdogs, all tasted great. The fries and milkshake, awesome. This location was quite busy, but they got our orders correct and to us in a reasonable time. I wish there was a Texas location.",1
101,Great cheap eats option and an absolute go to when in Chicago,1
102,"I ordered the Chicago hot dog and Italian sandwich. Both were excellent. The bun on the hot dog was a little soggy with all that went on the hot dog, but flavor very good esp. with the celery salt. The Italian beef sandwich definitely deserves to be ordered in the larger size...not because the sandwich was small, but it was that good and full of flavor.",1
103,Soggy hotdogs wrapped up in a throw-away paper wrapping. Taste soso (for a non-American). I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone wanting a traditional hand-made American hotdog :-(,0
104,"I was on my work break and saw a super long line both inside the restaurant and out to get food. I know portillos is normally fast but unfortunately I couldn’t wait like usual. I should’ve realized since it was nice out it would be crowded.  Defeated, I got out of the line when the general manager spotted me leaving and asked why. After explaining my situation, he got my food as fast as possible and I was able to get back to work in time. I did not catch his  name, but he was so kind because he really didn’t have to work with me! He clearly goes above and beyond and it’s much appreciated! Shoutout to the Ontario location ☺️",1
105,The food I did receive was good! The Italian beef was amazing. However our service was poor and multiple items on our  order were wrong or simply forgotten. Waited a total of nearly 2 hours. The poor service out weighed the good food.,0
106,"Still the leader in professional fast food. A perfect representation of Chicago fast food. The only difference at Portillo's everything is always fresh and cooked to order. The hot dogs are the best in the City, a fabulous burger that is very underrated, great Italian beef and ribs. A true Chicago gem.",1
107,What a Chicago experience! We are visiting friends who live in downtown Chicago who have been bragging on the Italian beef sandwiches and the Chicago hot dogs. So we had high expectations and were not disappointed with the food. Getting what you ordered is a bit chaotic. This is also a good place for people watching; they are always busy.,1
108,"Best dog in the country.
Every time I am in town, this makes me feel at home.",1
109,"Love the food here, and the people calling and handing out food are awesome! Sure it takes a bit, but it's a total experience and they make it fun instead of stressful. Great place for a classic Chicago dog, with lots of other good food options. Beer too if that's your thing.",1
110,"Delicious!! Definitely worth the hype! We got the Chicago style hotdogs and chocolate cake shakes, really yummy. The restaurant was beautifully decorated with nice staff. Super duper kid-friendly.  We ubered there because parking is nonexistent! LOL",1
111,"It is very popular with tourists and is very large, but that doesn't mean the food is not outstanding. We ordered a lot of items, and they were all delicious. The hot dogs, the Italian beef, and the polish sausage were all great. You will leave full.",1
112,Awesome Italian subs and the chocolate cake milkshake is delicious!,1
113,"We don't have many good eats in the USA, however - this PORTILLO'S holds up very well even if it's placed right in the middle of Budapest, Munich or Wien!!!!  Great job Portillo's Family - there is NO BETTER FAST FOOD in the USA - except maybe those vegan drive throughs in San Diego ...",1
114,"Fun Chicago experience. Lots going on inside to look at; tons of character. So many food options. I was being a tourist so asked my server to help me order. I got the Portillo hot dog - delicious and just the right amount of spicy, cheese fries (which are just fries served with a container of average hot cheese), and the chocolate cake shake which was really yummy. Great service. Pretty quick food prep. They were open late on a Sunday which was a bonus!",1
115,"Guy who took my order hated his life, messed up my drink and my sandwich, and when I got it the bread was a soggy mess. The only redeeming factor was the interesting decor.",0
116,"The food here is excellent! Got to love Portillo's. Classic Chicago dogs that are well made. This place is extremely hectic, so be ready to pay attention for your food. Overall, crazy and awesome atmosphere and I really enjoyed it.",1
117,Long wait and unorganized but the food is good.  After all you can never have enough polish sausage.,1
118,"They say everybody loves Portillos, but it was just average to me.
I would compare it to ZESTOs in the south. Zesto has the better shakes and burgers ,Portillos has the Italian steak sandwich ,hotdogs and polish sausages.
The south just doesn't do those well.",1
119,"I love the beef and cheddar croissant with sweet n hot peppers, but holy cow, be prepared to wait. Even when there isn't a huge line it usually takes about 20 minutes to get my food. I've been to sit down full service restaurants that were faster. However the end result is delicious.",1
120,"We went at lunch time and it was packed, there were lines both to order and pick up your food, however we got our food quite fast. We got a maxwell street style polish and an Italian beef sandwich which were amazing. The chocolate cake shake is good, but a bit too thick.",1
121,"Although I had a hard time biting into the hot dogs due to overwhelming sauce and toppings, I liked their hot dogs. The whole place is like a large food hall, so you could sit wherever you want and the place is kept clean.
Sausages were not too salty and perfectly cooked, but I wished there were some more veggie toppings (onions) that could balance the flavors.",1
122,"This place is not for the timid or the person afraid of loud crowds.  Take a few minutes and decide what you want before getting in line, the employees we encountered was not helpful or friendly.  The food was great and they got every part of our order correct.    For this reason we all decided we would eat there again.  They have great classic Chicago hotdogs!",1
123,Every tourist and Chicagoan should eat here at least once. I recommend the beef combo. It gives you a giant Italian sausage and italian beef in one sandwich. On your receipt there is a survey that will give you a free large fry with any purchase upon completion.,1
124,"First time I came here was for the hot dogs and they were amazing. The second time one of my friends recommended the ribs... And they did not steer me wrong. The ribs are one of the best I've tasted, very juicy and just the perfect amount of seasoning. The meat just falls off the bones. Would highly recommend this place for both the hotdogs and the ribs.",1
125,Best hot dogs in Chicago. Really nice ambience in the store. They also serve pasta here amongst lots of other things. Their Chicago style hot dogs are delicious. Their strawberry milkshake is thick and rich with real strawberry bits. We completed their online survey and got a free slice of cake.,1
126,"The beef sandwiches are awesome! Def get it with extra gravy and mixed peppers.. 🤤
Dogs were good too.",1
127,"A good place to try some ""famous"" Chicago dogs and Italian beef.  I definitely liked the interior decor, themed like an old-time Chicago.  Food was served quickly and rather inexpensive.

The food for the most part was very good, can't complain but the Italian beef was very soggy, was a bit disappointed.",1
128,"How is this as good as it is? I don't understand and I don't care. Even if you're normally picky, get the original version of the hot dog! Don't fuss with it! It's perfect and everything works together in artery-clogging harmony. The fries are always fresh too. One of my favorite Chicago traditions!",1
129,Very busy old place. It was a little tough to find seating and a little intimidating ordering the first time but it was a great experience. Must orders are the chili cheese dog and the Italian beef sandwich. Bother were delicious. The meat ball I ordered was also super juicy. Highly recommended to try.,1
130,"Love, love, love this staple for the Chicago visitor with limited time.  Stamp at least two items on your Chicago foods bingo card in one fell swoop.  Can you find better versions of Chicago-style hot dogs and Italian beef?  Certainly.  But Portillo's is reliably excellent when you don't have time to play food detective.  Please open one in northeast Atlanta!",1
131,"Cool place, ideal for latenight eats!",1
132,"The first location a relative tried in 1995 and we frequently have a craving for the hamburgers among other stuff, as its all good and despite new ownership, the quality remains top notch.",1
133,"There are so many choices and so many great horn dog stops and we are so glad we picked Portillo's!! They have a ton of other choices, even a wonderful chicken noodle soup!! The service is top notch and beyond efficient. It made me wish I could work here. Wonderful atmosphere and a must if visiting Chicago!",1
134,"My first Chicago dog experience.  Not sure what i was expecting but it was kind of like a food court.  Slightly chaotic with people swamping the food pick up area.  Be very careful when you place your order.  My son wanted a plain dog with cheese and wound up with ""the works"" plus cheese.  All in all the food was pretty good.",1
135,"Enjoyable spot for a quick meal. There's a reason it's so popular. Good food and decent prices. It was absolutely packed when we went for lunch, but it moved quickly and efficiently. My only complaint is that they got my order wrong, but they remedied the situation quickly (despite seeming unapologetic). I plan to be back for sure!",1
136,"Food was great!!!!! Customer service, horrible.",1
137,"Yikes! Walking in was overwhelming. We had no idea where to go to get a hot dog. We had to ask someone. It was definitely fast service but maybe too fast. And also they were rude. When we finally got our food and dug into it, the hot dog buns were all soggy. But the meat was good. I wish We would have gone somewhere more local. Overall, it was a good atmosphere. Won’t go back again. 👍🏽",1
138,"Go to the cashier to order, and then go to the different counters to pick up your food.

We came here to try the famous Chicago dog and dipped Italian sandwich. I was a bit underwhelmed overall. The dog was nothing special. I like a lot of toppings on my hot dog, but the beef dog, and the bun were nothing special, in my opinion.

The flavor of the sandwich was good, but I definitely don't understand the value of a dipped sandwich, resulting in a ton of soggy bread...",1
139,Really great food and a nice atmosphere.  It's a little loud inside but it's understandable with everything going on.  The line to receive food can get pretty disorganized but they did their best to keep it moving quick.  The chocolate cake shake was amazing.,1
140,Always amazing.  Ppl are great food is great,1
141,"Quite cozy and affordable place. Not very healthy food, I guess, but if you have a few minutes and want to eat in a cool place, you're welcome. Quite crowded, quite noisy, but, you know, in places like this you can feel a taste of life. Unfortunately, online orders are not so fast as you would like to. You should write down your name and wait, wait, wait...maybe 5-10 minutes on lunchtime. But everything else is acceptable. Have a good day!",1
142,"U can't go wrong with portillos unless you're gonna order online 🤣 I don't know why they had items as unavailable :( especially the cheese sauce , like that's the best part",1
143,One of my favorite places in Chicago to eat at. I love their double bacon cheeseburger. My experience was quick and the tables were nice and clean,1
144,"Needed a late night snack after a long day of work in dc and the fuy at the security desk of the building without any hesitation recommended Portillos. Went over, felt a little overwhelmed for my first time there but the staff was super friendly and werent afraid to make recomendations. The chicken soup hit the spot for a late night snack and the Portillo hot dog was fantastic! Would recommend to anyone in chi town.",1
145,"I came on the recommendation of friends to try something distinctly Chicago while we're visiting.  We LOVED the food!  The environment if fun, the people are super nice, and despite how busy it was, ordering was easy and food came out fast.  Well done!",1
146,"Drive thru for a quick order. Incredibly fast, open late. The food was above average but the beef was a bit salty. Each person's taste buds are different. Have the chocolate cake, most sinful morsel.",1
147,"I only make it to Chicago once a year, but every time I do this is first on my list of places to eat. I seriously haven't found an Italian Beef better anywhere else. Dipped with hot peppers in the way to go! I could probably order it upward of five times a week and not tire of it, that's how delicious this sandwich is. For as busy as this location always is, they pump the orders out quickly, and there is a minibar where you can grab a beer while you wait. I love this place.",1
148,If you want a Chicago style dog this is definitely the place to go. So many flavors in one bite. And the fries are fresh as can be. Will definitely be back before I leave at home.,1
149,"Great place to eat, good food and drinks.",1
150,"Food is excellent, NEVER GO BETWEEN 11:00 -1:00 P.M. GOSH
THIS PLACE IS PACK..",1
151,"Tender ribs, well cooked, probably one of the best in Chicago",1
152,"2 1/2 stars is more accurate. It’s so unorganized, it’s painful. We waited 45 minutes for a hot dog and Italian beef sandwich. When we finally got the food, the food was so soggy that it was inedible. Sad because other times we’ve come, it wasn’t quite so bad. The cake shakes make up for some of it though — those are delicious!!",0
153,"The Italian beef sandwich was good, I should have gotten it dry and my wife wasn't a fan of the Portillos dog. It had a nice snap when bitten, but you were chewing on the casing a little too long. I'm sure most people are fans of the dog, just not everyone.",1
154,"I like Portillo's, but I ordered takeout from this place and they barely paid attention to the order.

They tried to give me two slices of chocolate cake in place of just one and two chocolate shakes.

They only gave me two orders of fries when I had ordered three, one with cheese sauce.

They didn't give me any of the sauces ordered, including the gravy for a sandwich, which had to be eaten completely dry because we only ordered gravy on the side.

I was able to catch the first two before leaving but didn't notice the missing sauces, which were pretty integral so the meal was not great.",1
155,"Cheap, fun, fast. Huge variety of basic good Chicago-style (and other) foods. Upstairs dining area was quiet when we were there. Lots to look at too!  Two of us had plenty to eat for less than $20!",1
156,"Gotta get a couple of Chicago-style dogs with everything on em. Delicious with all the good stuff squished into a steamed bun. A side of those delicious crinkle cut fries and you're all set!

But...you might want to try a burger. They're really good, too. If you're feeling particularly saucy, add a chocolate cake shake and waddle out happy.",1
157,Everyone needs to experience a Chicago style hot dog!,1
158,"I’ll start by confessing I’m not a huge fan of Chicago-style hot dogs or Italian beef sandwiches. It’s not that I don’t like them, it’s just that I don’t see what all the fuss is about.

That said, there’s a lot to like about Portillo’s. Foremost, it’s not a hot dog stand or a dumpy diner, it’s a stylish, themed, village-like food court with several counters: one for their specialties, a separate operation for Italian food, and a hamburger counter. The interior ambiance is great.

The main attractions are hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches, so that’s what I tried.

The Chicago dog was pretty much like all the others I’ve had: very soft roll with poppy seeds, very tender dog, green relish, large pickle, and a couple of sport peppers. Nothing really distinguished it, except that the sport peppers were a bit tamer than some I’ve had, making it easier to taste the rest.

The Italian beef was less interesting. The very tender shaved beef had little flavor, and the very soft, soggy roll didn’t thrill me. I’m not sure what would have fixed this, but no condiments were available. I wouldn’t order it again.

The vanilla shake was good, a bit frothy compared to some.

Overall Portillo’s was fine, but I see no compelling reason to return.",1
159,Atmosphere is crowded but entertaining in its own little way when it comes to the art around restaurant. I made the mistake of getting shaved beef sandwich on croissant. It was flavorless greasy and soggy 😝😝. My son's hot dog and fries however was good. I may go back while in Chicago but will only stick to hotdogs from here.,1
160,"I haven't been here in a few years, due to moving out of the area. I was always a big fan of the onion rings, not anymore, the breading isn't as good as it use to be.",1
161,Love my Italian beef and sausage combo,1
162,Pretty tasty- great service.,1
163,Very crowded.  I had 2 loaded hot dogs.  Delicious.  Those who had the Italian Beef were also pleased with those leals.,1
164,"Soggy hot dog, tiny fries, mediocre food, touristy.",0
165,"Can't say enough good things about this place. As a rule my boyfriend and I like to try new places when out of town and don't eat anywhere we have at home or places we have already tried. That being said, this is our second trip to Chicago in a couple years and our 4th visit. We will also come back when in town again. This place is really that good!

Oh, I also ordered a bundle of Chicago dogs online for Boyfriend's birthday and everything arrived on time, organized perfectly, and absolutely delicious. I don't know their method, but it doesn't matter. Ordering and having it delivered - anywhere in the country!! - or dining in, you won't go wrong. Get one or three. Your taste buds will thank you!",1
166,"Eh I would call it mediocre. In town for a visit and wants a Chicago style hot dog. I really hope this isn’t what it’s supposed to be like. Mine was tiny and squished at the bottom of the bag. And the disproportionately large ingredients were just falling out of the bun.

Getting the food was pretty straightforward and quick. Although fighting people to get to the counter was slightly aggravating. But that isn’t the businesses fault.

Overall just not my cup of tea. Maybe I just had bad luck, which I would assume has to be true considering the over 4,000 positive 4+ star reviews. But I will not be returning.",0
167,I will eat there every time I'm close to one. Fantastic!,1
168,They prioritise the drive-through rather than the people who are actually there. This is a terrible decision.,1
169,"Definitely fine Chicago street food. Cheap, relatively fast, fattening (but flavorful), and as one person wrote homely looking food.

Variety available for the family, everyone can find something because they don't just serve hot dogs (pasta, ribs, wraps salads, etc) but you should try the hot dogs.

Try the namesake hot dog, beef and cheddar on a croissant, crinkle cut fries and check out the chocolate cake shake or just get the chocolate cake!",1
170,"Really enjoyed it, this was my first visit and it lived to the hype that all my Chicagoland buddies have been saying. If it's your first time going get the Italian Beef with Hot Peppers and any hot dog. I had the chili dog was really glad I got it. This place was really good, seating was easy to find and the food came out quick.",1
171,"Don't get the Italian beef, they forgot the seasoning!!!! It tasted like bread water and tough stringy meat. Really disappointed! This was my favorite portillos, now it's like they don't care,  and my fries were Luke warm.",0
172,The best cafeteria in all of Chicago. Hot dogs are fine. Everything else tastes fairly empty. Cheese fries are hard to mess up but still enjoyable. This place is a madhouse.,1
173,"A must-try at Chicago. This downtown store is always crowded (which is not a bad thing) and opens late. It also has a drive through (although waiting time could be long in weekends). Besides the hot dog, personally I also like the beef and sausage combo. Love the decoration and atmosphere in the store.",1
174,"I can't wait to go to Portillos again, but in Orlando.",1
175,"Good Italian Beef and Chocolate cake shake is weird but good.  Cute but busy atmosphere. Hard to get/keep a table if you're by yourself. Wish I got a Chicago dog too, but I was too full of cake shake.",1
176,"My first Chicago style hotdog and didn't disappoint.  The place to go for a Chicago dog! And the service is great from the moment you walk in, and because this place fills up fast at lunch I'd advise going later on after 1pm or so to grab a seat if your wanting to eat in .",1
177,"Fun place, but the chaos waiting for orders and scouting for a table was frustrating. First time having a Chicago Style Hot Dog and I'm not a fan,  I'm going to stick with mustard and relish. My husband loved his Chocolate Cake Shake.",1
178,"They have fantastic hot dogs, but the restaurant itself is a little chaotic. It was very busy, and we waited in line both to order and to get our food. The hot dog was worth the wait, but I wish I would have ordered more than one, because. By the time I ate mine the line was too long to get back in line to get another one.",1
179,We have been going here for years. But my latest experience has me thinking I need to find a better place for Italian beefs when visiting Chicago. Super slow service (waited 20 minutes for food). Received so little beef in our sandwiches we couldn’t see it without opening the bun. I gave it three stars based on past experience but if it was my first time it would have been one star.,1
180,"You go to Portillo's For the Italian beef your way and they don't even try , and you realize you just gave your money away for bad service with no remedy pitiful.",0
181,"It's good to find an affordable place to eat in Chicago. But this one also has a really fun atmosphere. Expect it to be noisy and to wait in line. But if you're looking for a good Chicago hot dog or Frozen Custard, this is the place to come.",1
182,Very interesting decor to add to the delicious Chicago dog. There is actually a large variety of food available beyond the hot dog. Great Dixieland and ragtime music also. Prices are very reasonable. Definitely will be back.,1
183,My favorite place to eat within the city of Chicago. Best Chicago style hot dog and Italian beef to be found in town!,1
184,Absolutely amazing.  As good as I'd been told.,1
185,Best Chicago style fast-food around,1
186,To think this guy's started selling hot dogs out of a shack is mind blowing to see how far this place has come and how much it has grown. . . .  Hands down my favorite beef in Chicago and if you're not from Chicago and don't know what an Italian beef is Do yourself a favor and make sure to stop by before you leave town. I can guarantee you you will not be disappointed . Also their desserts and shakes are great I recommend the strawberry shortcake and if you really have a sweet tooth get the chocolate cake shake which is literally a chocolate shake with a piece of their homemade chocolate cake blended in. 6 out of 5 stars all day long!,1
187,"Food was good, nothing outstanding. I do appreciate they had some vegetarian options with a mushroom burger, but they need to add vegetarian hot dogs. I've been to smaller hit dog places that even have soy dogs. Online said open until 1am Saturdays but at midnight we were rushed out because they were closing.",1
188,"Really good hot dogs, cheese fries, and chocolate cake. Huge pasta bowls & salads with much more than just lettuce, too. They do serve beer (21+).  Fun atmosphere and clean. On corner of Clark & Ontario with Hard Rock, Rainforest Cafe, and 24hr McDonald's in River North, so can get a little crowded, but there's quick service inside & via the drive thru. My favorite fast food, casual dinner spot downtown.",1
189,"Not a true Chicago dog to wrap it all
in paper - makes for a wet experience and not what I want when it comes to what should be an iconic food experience. This is just my view after living in this city for many years",0
190,"An incredible energy here! Honest food made where you can see it. A fast pace, with a delicious outcome! All the best things about Chicago food.",1
191,"This place came highly recommended by a lot of friends, but honestly,  the hot dog was saggy, sausage itself was warm, almost like the whole thing got microwaved. The two stars are for the place itself, cool vibe and pretty clean.",0
192,Always busy. Staff always friendly. Tables cleaned really fast. Try the big beef if you always get the hotdogs. Always worth the trip when I visit Chicago. They have some great stuff decorating their walls. Enjoy.,1
193,Best beef sandwich ever!  Don’t leave Chicago without trying one!,1
194,"The absolute best hotdogs.  A Chicago favorite. No ketchup to mask the flavors just celery salt, peppers, relish, fresh onions and tomatoes.",1
195,Hot dog wonderful & ribs fell off the bone moist!,1
196,"A must visit for a Chicago style hot dog or an Italian beef (they also have burgers, ribs, chicken sandwiches...). Great atmosphere, felt like I was walking into the 1930’s! While it was busy, it didn’t feel crowded and the service was great! Oh... helpful hint... do not ask for ketchup on your hotdog, the rule is almost a religion in this city.",1
197,I feel like everything here could be a good deal if you just gave it a shot. Chicago Style Dogs were cheap and tasted good. Their rib combo is also hella worth it! An extra $3 for extra food items on top of a whole or half rack of ribs depending on you!,1
198,We walked out because the wait was so long the first time we went but we decided to stick it out the second time. We waited over an hour in line just to order and another 20-30 minutes for the food to be done. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either and certainly not worth the wait in our family's opinion. It is obviously a very popular spot in downtown Chicago and has a good reputation. It just wasn't our favorite.,1
199,"Only reason I gave a 1 star, the cheddar cheese is good!!! I ordered a delivery from grub hub and I can't say enough bad things!!! Some of my order wasn't in the bag!!! I only got 2 little dressing sauces with a big salad!!! Possibly cause I ordered dressing on the side!!! To continue, my fries was cold!!! Im very disappointed with this location!!! I will not be ordering from here again!!! To add, I lIve in Chicago and my lunch experience was horrible today!!! A shame on Chicago restaurants!!! No wonder our city have nothing but bad things to say about it!!!",0
200,"We were on vacation and its so good to frequent an all Black Owned business and franchise, all the employees were African American, and it was good this company embraces diversity and hires people from the community.  The food was pretty good, the ceasar salad was just okay, but the custard, and chocolate cake was tasty. The frozen custard was pretty good and the price was great! Very busy on weekend, but worth the wait in line.",1
201,"Great place 👍🏻
Besides hot dogs, burgers, and fries they also offer soups (usually chicken noodle, broccoli cheddar, or tomato bisque), salads (served in portions big enough for two), ribs, and beer. Employees are friendly and seem to be working efficiently and quickly. Restrooms are fairly clean, considering how busy the his place can be. And yes, you would have to wait for your order for 10 minutes if you come in during lunch hour, late evening or a Sunday night. This location is decorated in a “prohibition-era” theme. There are two floors. There’s a drive through.  For first time visitors I’d recommend a jumbo, cheese fries, and lemonade.",1
202,Good Chicago style hot dogs. We were there on St. Patrick's day and it was a bit of a madhouse. It will probably be less so when you go. There are a number of other food items. We had the beef sandwich too which was also good.,1
203,"The chocolate cake shake was fantastic. The wait was not. And the jumbo chili cheese dog seemed, unfortunately, like an ironic description. Worth a visit to the iconic restaurant, but keep those expectations in check.",1
204,I've been here several times and pretty much always get the same thing: hot dog with everything but tomato & relish.The service is fast considering how busy it is. The beers are good and BIG. The chocolate cake which I've had once is not as great as reputation would suggest. They could do a little better job cleaning up tables but it's hard with such high turnover.,1
205,"Little let down by this place after it was so hyped up. I think it only has such a high rating because everyone jumps on the band wagon and gives it so much undeserved attention.

The customer service was non existent. Wasn't particularly busy but the employees all seemed angry and miserable and chaotic. Terrible process for getting your food. You crowd around 20 other people while they call numbers even though you don't need to crowd. Then they might hand you your food but another worker is in charge of drinks and doesn't know to hand you your drink. Also the lines to order are disorganized. The signage and menus are just hard to read.

My hot dog was a let down, tasted like it had been warmed up in plastic, so it had a chemical plastic sort of flavor.

It wasn't very clean either. Tables weren't cleaned and a busser abandoned their area with a trash can cabinet wide open and cleaning cart in the way.

Chocolate cake was pretty good.",0
206,"Such an absolute shame!  Visiting Chicago with my family. We were really excited to try this place as we’d heard great things about it. We ordered our food at 9:03pm after sightseeing. Didn’t get all of our food until 10:05pm and two conversations with the manager. (This was only after the girl calling orders had called for a manager twice who never showed up, my husband called the restaurant number and was hung up on, then I decided to go back to the order line to ask for a manager) The employees didn’t seem to care about customer service. They seemed quite lazy actually. We finally received our order...mostly correct. I would never recommend this place. Especially if you’re going with hungry kids. Horrible and irritating experience.",0
207,The Restaurant Had A Crowded But Welcoming Atmosphere. Food Took Way Too Long To Get Ready & Was Ordered Online. However The Staff Was Friendly & The Food Was Better Than Ever,1
208,It's a fun place. Arguably the best because everyone is going to have a slightly different take on what makes a place the best but it's a great baseline to judge the rest from.,1
209,"Quick and tasty. Its more of a fast food Cafe style than a restaurant style, but still has authentic Chicago flavor and style. You should try it.",1
210,Great food for good prices. Took a little long till we got served.,1
211,"The restaurant is noisey, but the food is always good. I recommend the Italian beef, but the hot dogs and burgers are good too. It's a busy place and it's nice to see a staff person always cleaning the lobby. This location has a drive through, but parking to dine in can be a bit of a challenge.",1
212,"My favorite Portillos location. They actually follow your order. The Italian beef was the best of any location. It had flavor and was double dipped just how I like it with juice dripping into the plastic to-go bag. YES!! Lol and my mozzarella cheese was put on the bottom also. You’ll be surprised how many locations can get simple tasks wrong. Come here and you’re sure to be a happy customer! Despite the street parking! Well worth it.
PS: Staff has evolved and the new crew don’t listen. Every single time they absolutely cannot get my order right. Why did they have to switch out the employees? 😞",1
213,"Good shakes, fries & hot dogs. It’s no combos. Everything has to be ordered separately",1
214,"Great taste of Chicago.  Visiting,  we tried the dogs= excellent,  and the Italian beef sandwich= excellent. I will come back every time I'm in Chicago",1
215,They literally have only ONE person working the catering section of the restaurant. Doing large catering orders and GrubHub ubereats Postmates etc by herself . Waited 40 minutes in line for one pickup !!,0
216,Great hotdog with great flavor.,1
217,"If I had one place on earth were I would spent eternity... It will be at Portillo's.
Just being endlessly eating some Chicago Style Hot Dog with a bowl of chili.

The place is fantastic, the mood and the decoration is special and unique. A good feel from the past. The staff is impressive, the way everything is running is a spectacle!

And everything is very cheap - Don't forget to get a sundae on your way out, the speciality of the house.

See you soon Chicago Style Hot Dog, I will soon be back.",1
218,"I don't have much to compare it too (first hot dog in Chicago), but it was certainly delicious, and the beef dip was great as well. My wife had a hotdog from another vendor in Chicago that was charbroiled, she preferred that one but still said these were delicious. I would definitely recommend it.",1
219,Lines to order were crazy  long. Difficult to find place to sit. Needed gluten free so only safe item I was told were French fries that are cooked in separate fryer.  Husband had hot dog. He said bun was soggy...mushy. Not pleasant to eat.  Son said roast beef sandwich was pretty good. Would not go back again.,0
220,"Ugh I wish there was Portillo’s out on the east Coast. I dream about a dipped Italian beef with hot peppers. My mouth is watering as I type this, that’s how much I love the place. I’m not a huge fast food lover but Portillo’s hits different every single time. No where comparable in my opinion.",1
221,I loved those beef hot dogs and Italian sandwiches! 😍 Customer service was excellent and the lines move quickly. Highly recommended!,1
222,"Neat place ran very efficiently. You must try the chocolate cake, it was so moist and rich. It was very busy on the inside, but things move fairly quickly and we managed to find an open table. The food was tasty and the staff was friendly enough. It's a noisy place, so keep that in mind. If I'm in the area, I will definitely stop in again.",1
223,"Amazing! We walked in late Saturday night,hungry after going to a comedy show. We had no idea about this place and decided to chance it. We both had pasta dishes.....and both were delicious! Quick friendly service. The young teens calling out the order numbers were fun and polite. I think we will go back again before we leave Chicago!",1
224,"Easily ranks in my top 5 slowest restaurant service experienceds. If I hadn't already paid, I'd have walked out. Almost did anyway. Stood in line for over 35min for a sandwich that takes <2min to make while at least 20 people who ordered after me got their orders ahead of me. Very disorganized. This while there are ~20 staff working behind the counter. Might give this place one more chance, but it'll be a while before I do.",0
225,"We were in a rush the last time we were here and honestly, do not come unless you have enough time  for the experience. The hot dogs are to die for! The Italian Beef sandwich will make lasting impressions on your taste buds! The chocolate cake shake is simply sweet crack!",1
226,"Very poor order fulfillment at this location. We waited 30 minutes for our order, both beefs were only sweet peppers when both were supposed to be hot and sweet and one was supposed to be dipped and was not. I would recommend going to the South Loop location. I've never had any issues there.",0
227,"This restaurant is in a great location for Chicago. They make a fantastic Chicago dog, as well as many other options. The store design is fun to observe, as it looks like a museum in some instances. I make a point to come here as often as I can.",1
228,Good food in a reasonable location for Chicago downtown. Price is a little more than competitors. Service here was slow though. We could see our orders sitting there just waiting to be bagged. There weren't a whole lot of orders to take care of either.,1
229,Absolutely loved the Chicago dog. My husband had the polish sausage and he said it was delicious. Reasonable price. Will definitely go again when we visit Chicago.,1
230,Mark the GM at Ontario and Clark excellent professional staff and especially Mark he helped me change my order from hot dog to cheeseburger. Took care of making the change as I proceeded in line. GREAT 👍,1
231,"You won't be disappointed. I'm a hotdog with ketchup kind of guy, but decided to go all in and get my hot dog with the works...so good. The combination of flavors is fantastic, service was quick (even with a fairly long line), prices were good, and there's plenty of seating.",1
232,"This place was awesome, for my first time ever being there. I had to go back everyday when I was in Chicago. I will always be a returning customer!

The food was amazing, love the cheeseburgers. the place was pretty packed, but still clean. Staff was very friendly, and very helpful.

Ordering through the drive-thru wasn’t to bad wither, at this time it was extremely cold outside and those guys were out there taking irders! Food was made quickly and fresh.

I will recommend Portillos to any and everyone!",1
233,Best Chicago hot dog I had. Also super affordable less than $5 for it!,1
234,"Fantastic food, beautiful Prohibition era decor, and decent on a budget! If you want a great sandwich or lots of dining options, this is a place you must check out! Even picky eaters like myself will find something they enjoy. I recommend the Italian beef sandwhich.",1
235,Always busy but solid and fast service per usual for Portillos. Convenient location with the beach and Michigan avenue a short distance away. Drive through is convenient but note parking is quite difficult. Especially to sit down. Red line is a short walk though. Outdoor patio is a nice spot as well outside of winter. One of the better choices in the area for great and quick food at reasonable prices. Wide menu with options for many. Even vegetarians.,1
236,"The food was great, the service needs work. My husband and I ordered two hot dogs and a fry a little after midnight.  I assumed it would be least busy then, but I don’t think there is ever a time they aren’t busy. Anyway, our order number was called about 5 minutes after placing the order, but took another 30 minutes of standing in line before we actually got our food. My husband said customers were irate and swearing at the servers. Obviously that’s unfair and uncalled for, but I could understand the frustration. The way orders are handled is clearly a system that needs improvement. I would eat the food again, but I’d order delivery. There was no line for delivery orders!",1
237,"I could see the fascination with the Chicago dog. However, the hype wasn't that worth it. The dog itself lacked the crisp snap and the bun wasn't complementing the condiments and toppings. The toppings were average at best, just be careful of the included hot peppers as there is a noticeable kick to it. Additionally the chocolate cake shake was cakey but lacked the adequate amount of liquid to make it an actually shake. If you had a spoon perhaps it'll be a more suitable tool for that drink. I'd say come for the setting as it's a very charming place for a tourist or local.",1
238,"It was very busy, but they move pretty quickly. The food was pretty good. They need to hire more people to clean up and they could use some better organization with seating people. But I guess that is how they do things, I just wasn't too impressed with that. Would I return, probably, but it would be for a pick up order.",1
239,"The chili cheese dog and onion rings were great. The Italian beef, I could do without. I would've given a better review but my daughter waited about 20-25 minutes for a cheeseburger that we went back to ask about multiple times and they kept saying it is coming. They had put it in the no answer pile of food when they never even called her number. When she got it it was cold and not good.  Had to have ot remade and wait, but not as long as the first time. Once she got it it was. a good burger but the experience was not.",1
240,"Not sure what the hype here is.  Picked it up at the drive thru which was convenient especially in the middle of the city.  They didn't send 2 of my side orders which I paid for.  The hot dogs were just ok, fries were soggy even though I asked for well done, and chili was meh.",0
241,"Chicago dog was good, but I wish they'd grill it. The cheese fries were a bit disappointing. Wish they'd pour cheese all over them rather than just give you a cup of cheese. The chocolate cake shake is a must! Delicious.",1
242,my experience tonight. 3/12. Went inside and waited + 20 minutes for my order which was only 3 orders of fries and a drink. The fries were ready however when I asked about my order the girl at the counter said my number wasn't called yet. I was 59 and they were calling 80 and 90. When I started looking annoyed and looking for a manager she gave me a partial order. I don't know what is happening there but I should not have had to wait for fries 20+ minutes!,1
243,"Food is always great and I love this location.
I go back quite often",1
244,"We loved the Chicago dog, the polish dog, and Italian beef at Portillo's! Everything we tried was great! We liked it so much we ate here twice! Will definitely be back to Chicago as soon as we can! Interesting decor inside as well.",1
245,"The food is great. No debate there. Ordering and picking up your food, chaos at dinner time. Especially if you've got pasta for one person and Italian beef or hot dog for the other. Seating is limited and tight at dinner too.",1
246,"The toppings make it. Man, it's good stuff. I had some dogs and half of a steak something or other that was incredibly moist. It was incredibly busy, so try going not during peak times. The drive through was not fast at all. 4 dogs, 1 notPhillysteak guy, some fries, something like 25 bucks.",1
247,"I love Portillo's Hot Dogs!!!! This place will always remind me of traditional American Food of Chicago! I don't know what they put in their jumbo hot dogs, but the sausage they use is notably different tasting and plumper than all the other dogs I have ever had. I also love their crinkle cut fries and cheese sauce. The cheese sauce is awesome!

I still have to try their ribs and have heard great things about their cake shake. No trip to Chicago is complete without Portillo's!",1
248,We were hungry for some Chicago-style hot dogs and beef sandwiches. When we get asked a lot of our friends had been in Chicago they all spoke of this place finally. I can say I've been to a lot of busy restaurants before and those that are normally busy seem to have a routine and a rhythm to be able to handle it. This place... Not so much. We waited in the enormous line to place our order and the line had no way to exit so you had to fight your way out to get over to the area where you would pick up your food. We waited for about 40 minutes for our food to be ready. They put the orders together in a very rushed disorganized fashion and it's a wonder they get anybody fed. I would say the food is fast food but it is certainly not made fast. Once we got our food it was delicious no doubt. However I don't think I would Brave the Line here to do it again.,1
249,"Nice place. Lots of hot dogs. Best fast food in the city, everything is tasty.",1
250,"Terrible customer service. Waited 45+ minutes for a pickup order with nobody there to acknowledge it. Big fan of Portillo’s, but not sure I’ll ever be coming back after this experience.",0
251,"Amazing Italian Beef. Takes about 20 minutes to order and get everything, but we'll worth the wait. Warning, not for those who are not used to close spaces. This place is packed, but the best way to get around the lines is to order online. I ordered an Italian Beef dipped, with peppers and cheese and it was fantastic. Like an amped up French dip.",1
252,Second time here. The Italian beef and hot dog are amazing but this time they wrapped the whole sandwich in paper making the bread very soggy. I prefer they served it in a paper tray like what was shown in photos and what I had few years back.,1
253,Good service but not that spacious.,1
254,"Other than being out of one of the items I wanted, everything was great. Great atmosphere and the Portillo dog was awesome.",1
255,I had Portillo’s last year on our road trip! It was the BEST stop I think I made on the trip! The hot dogs were delicious! Definitely try if you never have or if your coming through Chicago! You won’t be disappointed!,1
256,"I'm not a huge fan, it's something to experience at least once but it's not a place I seek out.  There's a The dogs are big but little flavor, the brats have a weird spice.  They aren't spicy just weird.  They don't really have a lot of options.  The hot beef really has no flavor at all, it must be cheap.  Oddly enough the only thing I really enjoyed was the ""wet bun"" where they added the beef broth to the bun.  The onion rings are greasy and sweet, didn't really care for them.",1
257,Let me tell you that the line is worth the wait. the hot dogs and sausages and milkshakes and fries in this place were off the chain. Mama and her group of efficient workers make the best damn dogs ever. I will be back I will eat more dogs and drink some more shakes.,1
258,Off the chart! Best Chicago hot dog ever. 1st time here and it did not disappoint. Thanks to the random security guy who referred this place to us. Love Love Love,1
259,Food is always great but it's crowded and the service could be a lot better,1
260,Terrible food no clue what they hype is all about. Ordered chili dog and it was cold and soggy. Order a beef and cheddar croissant and it was worse than microwaved. Took everything back and staff looked at me like I was crazy and said I ordered it wrong need to tell them not to wet it?? Wet a hot dog and a croissant? Wish I could show the pics of this. Place is a trap don’t waste your time or money.,0
261,A must when you come to the city,1
262,"Terrible service! Rude customers and they forgot to add the patty to my burger, told them no relish still added relish and then couldn’t get a hold of them on the phone, WILL NOT RECOMMEND!!!!",0
263,Never take a trip to Chicago without eating at Portillo’s.,1
264,"Excelent food... Nice environment. I got the half BBQ ribs and was delicious. My son had pasta bowl and a salad and was really tasty. Good prices, fast service, clean restaurant and nice staff. The sodas has refill...",1
265,"Yummmy! Long but very efficient lines, they moved the crowd nice and did not have long wait time on the food. Supper delicious! We enjoyed the chocolate cake, the chili, the hotdogs, the tamales, the milkshakes, the salt... ok you get the point! My friend only had two drink of her milkshake and it spilled outside. The staff was super friendly about it, she got a new/ full one for FREE. They didn’t get everything in our bag/ order two out of the four orders. So CHRCK YOUR BAG, but they will make it right/ get you the food when you notice it.",1
266,"The food was good, customer service could have been better.",1
267,"This eatery is normally very busy and at times there is a line to get in. However, the pace is fast here so try to look at the menu before coming to shorten time waiting. Also, consider how hungry you are because if you fall short on your order, adding to would mean standing in line again. The food is good, while something you may have had before it's an upgrade to experience their take. And don't forget the shakes, sides, and drinks. Happy eating!",1
268,"The most impressive part of this place was their efficiency, they crank out hundreds of order so fast!! The food is great and the Italian beef dipped.... Fantastic. But if you aren't from Chicago, you're probably expecting cheese or something on a beef sandwich, this was nothing but beef and an au jus gravy... The beef really does speak for itself but maybe get it dipped so it's not dry. The Portillo's Dog (Chicago dog style) is always a safe and delicious choice.",1
269,"Great spot for Italian beef. Be sure to try the chocolate cake and the cake shake - you won't be disappointed. It can get crazy crowded here, especially with tourists, but it's with the wait. And, the line moves quickly, so don't get discouraged.",1
270,First visit to Chicago and everyone was seeing to try Portillo's. Ive had better chili cheese dogs and the bacon cheeseburger I got was pretty standard. If you're looking for a cheaper easy bite to eat give them a try.,1
271,"Walked in and told a woman (Momma T) we were new and was treated like royalty. She sat us down in a Hidey hole , told us what to order for first timers and then ordered for us, brought our food, and then gave us Cake!! It was amazing!!! We had Italian Beef with Cheddar, Mozerella, hot peppers lightly dipped. Chicago dog. French fries WITH cheese, and onion rings! The food was amazing! Service was amazing! Great first time experience!!!",1
272,Go and get whatever you want because it’s all delicious and has a great vibe. I’d highly recommend getting super fat and ordering the chocolate cake shake. They blend up their famous chocolate cake into their chocolate shake and it’s honestly to die for. Fries and chili cheese dogs are also great.,1
273,"Too crowded. Poor logistics, food is good but not great. I had to wait over 30 minutes in multiple lines to get what should be Chicago 'Quick Service Restaurant' faire. Would rather go to Malnati's/Gino's East/Al's Beef for better food faster.",1
274,Food. Lots and lots.  First timer? Then go with the Portillos beef hot dog loaded and cheese fries.,1
275,"Highly recommended! I'm an Chinese and really not a fan of the 'Chicago style hot dog (yeah I tried it but no special feeling)', but the Italian beef is a must-have! The beef is so juicy and tasty, surprisingly like the beef (noodle) I had in Kyoto, Japan.",1
276,"I like Portillo's a lot but sometimes I don't think it deserves the God-like status it has among certain people. I think their fries are great, their hot dogs are some of the best and their beef sandwiches are awesome too. Beyond that I think their menu is pretty average and the restaurants themselves try a bit too hard to be Chicago-y for my taste. Still I would recommend trying it, because I do think the food is good and it is a Chicago institution.",1
277,"What a funky place!
Staff was well organized, Char-grilled Maxwell st. style Polish was awesome!",1
278,"Normal Chicago eats (Chicago Style Hot Dogs, Italian Beef, Italian Combos, etc) with fast service considering how busy they always are. The staff is usually very friendly and helpful (had an issue once with a staff member) and my order is usually correct (I place my order online and pick it up to go). Other than that it's a great place to grab a quick bite or take people from out of town for a real Chicago food experience. They can be a little pricey considering everything a la carte, but worth every bite.",1
279,"Grew up loving Portillos. Theres a reason that line is always long. If you're a burger fan, it will surely be in your top 5.",1
280,Chicago style hot dogs - 10/10,1
281,"They're always so efficient at getting people through, and super friendly. Even with the longest lines I've never waited more than 10 minutes from entering to walking out with my food here, with it still super hot and fresh. Somehow they manage to do this and the dining area is still always impeccably clean!",1
282,"For a place that's packed with queues at lunchtime, it was surprisingly fast service. The classic Chicago hot dog was somewhat small but satisfyingly tasty and I'll have to be back to try the other variations. Save some room for a sundae dessert!",1
283,"All the food kinda just seemed like mediocre fast food. Italian beef was a bit bland, the hot dog was ok but wish the toppings were cut up so they didn't just keep falling off when I took a bit. Also not a huge fan of boiled hot dogs compared to grilled. The chicken club was pretty good, probably my favorite of the 3. The chocolate cake shake was good but kinda hard to mess it up lol. I'd go for a quick bite if it wasn't always so busy but since it is, probably wouldn't go back.",1
284,"This is a great location in Chicago.  It's very, very busy and you can't go wrong with any of the tasty items in the menu.  However, it is easy to get to if you are walking or getting dropped off. If you are driving get ready for a big headache. They don't have their own parking lot.  If you are not familiar with the area you will become frustrated because of the way traffic flows down Clark St and Ontario.  Both streets are a one way.  Clark goes south and Ontario goes west only.
Even if you manage to get to the drive through section of the eatery be prepared to wait or get stuck in your vehicle for a good while. Even if your order is ready, paid for and have it in hand you still won't be able to leave because other customers can be parked in front of you waiting for their order. There is no place to go since there are only two lanes.  It is a big mess. The employees are rude and forget that they with with the public so they have side conversations which includes fowl language.
Anyway, it's still worth stopping by and sampling the great Chicago style dishes. Just remember not to drive or be in a hurry.",1
285,"Absolutely excellent! I was in Chicago for a week for work and one of our co-workers there suggested that we eat Portillo's for lunch and let me tell you: chick-fil-a needs to move over, there's a new chicken sandwich in town and it was so good! The chicken sandwich was perfectly fried and nestled between two buns, some lettuce and mayo. The fries are also excellent. I really enjoyed the entire meal. It was exactly what I needed that week: greasy delicious food. BTW try a milkshake! They don't disappoint! The only bad thing about this restaurant is that there isn't one in Atlanta and I will have to go back to Chicago to get my fix again! Loved this place.",1
286,"Really enjoyed my first Chicago-style hot dog!  The jumbo dog was big and flavorful and the pickle and pepper complemented the meat.  Fries were good, too.  (Got it to go.)",1
287,"Very poor costumer service at this location,  gave as uncooked hot dogs",1
288,"They make a pretty good hot dog, but personally I don't think it's worth the hassle of ordering and waiting during peak hours. For the uninitiated, the ordering process is akin to waiting in a theme park ride. One must wait in line to order at one of the many cashiers. Once your order is placed, you get a number and wait for that number to be called at a counter. The problem is that there are at least 50 to 75 people doing the same thing during lunch or dinner rushes. Numbers are not it called out sequentially so if you are number 50, don't be surprised if you start hearing 75 or 112. They just haven't gotten to your order yet. I orders a single hot dog during a lunch hour recently. Ordering took 5 minutes, but waiting for my order took nearly 25 minutes. 30 minutes for a single hot dog?! My advice is to avoid the rush.",1
289,"Absolutely a must try if you're in Chicago. I travel to Chicago and stay in the Holiday Inn Cass Hotel to eat Portillo's twice per day for a week. If I were on death row my final meal request would be Portillo's. When I sleep, I dream of Portillo's Italian beef sandwich, and when I wake up my pillow is soaked in drool.",1
290,"Great atmosphere and quick service! Stopped in for dinner and the wait time was reasonable considering how crazy, busy it was. Food was hot and fresh as well!",1
291,Google Maps said that this was the least busy time but it was still pretty packed. We got the most basic hot dog and it did not disappoint. We also got the Chocolate Cake Shake which was insanely good.,1
292,Went here to try the iconic hot dogs and hot beef sandwiches. They were okay; but honestly did not impress. I have had better hot dogs elsewhere. The sandwich was more than a little soggy and my strawberry malt was just a strawberry malt.,1
293,"Two stars based on our experience. We saw other people that had pasta and ribs that looked good, but we opted for the over hyped hot dog, Italian beef, and the chocolate cake.

The hot dogs taste is good... but they are basic boiled hot dogs. We prefer grilled flavor. The buns on both sandwiches are good. The Italian beef was decent but we've heard there are much better places in the city.

We came for the chocolate cake - and it was good, but not earth shattering.

It was VERY busy on a Sunday at 2. Confusing for a first timer. Staff was RUDE. At the pick up counter for drinks, I told the woman I ordered two bottles of water. She rudely asked ""Did you pay for them?,"" with an attitude. I said ""yes ma'am"" and tried to show her my receipt. She rolled her eyes and walked away. She returned a few minutes later with the water. I said ""thank you, have a good day,"" to which she again rolled her eyes and walked away.

Overall: if you are a chocolate cake lover, go ahead and grab a piece here. If not, not worth the wait or the sass.",0
294,"The environment can be very overwhelming and the menu is HUGE, but it really is a great place to eat. Everyone raves about their Italian Beef (which is valid - they're delicious), but I personally recommend their burgers. They are a perfect rendition of a classic. No matter what you order, it's bound to be good.
Beyond the masses of people and food. The environment is pretty great. Each portillos has a different theme and I especially love the details included at this location.",1
295,"Portillo’s Chicago dog was delicious! Service was super fast (even though they were busy), the staff was nice and the atmosphere with all the throwback memorabilia was awesome. Totally recommend, Norbert and I had a great time! 🙌🏽🌭🍟",1
296,"Simply the best.
They opened one Phoenix where I live, but not as good the Chicago place.
Had Italian beef and sausage combo with a beer and was in heaven.
It's a greasy sandwich, but you don't feel it later. Even had caramel custard.
And the atmosphere is great.
A Chicago must.
.",1
297,"This place has the lunch hour tactics down! My friends and I were in and out with no problems whatsoever. Prices are higher due to the location, but you can never go wrong with Portillo's. I usually get the ribs or hot dogs which are great!",1
298,"Classic Chicago style hot dogs for the best price in town. Sesame bun, sport peppers, sweet relish, juicy tomatoes, a strip of mustard, and a pickle spear to top it all off. Plenty of seating and the old school diner feel is just awesome.",1
299,"You can never go wrong with chili cheese fries and a beef and cheddar sandwich! So good, wish I could eat it again! Finished my meal with a strawberry shortcake that had a wonderfully light texture and a ample portion.",1
300,Very busy place but it runs like clockwork. I ordered the full slab of ribs dinner and the price was very reasonable. I only had to wait about 10 minutes for my to go order. They have a totally huge menu. Their hotdogs and beef sandwiches are awesome also. You have to stop by here and try it out,1
301,"I had a feeling that it would take a while to order and eat, but I must say that the staff kept the pace moving fast for a lot of people Obviously the food was great",1
302,"I have come here a couple of times now, with no need to feel like stopping. It's best to come after you have had a couple of drinks, but then all places get better post booze and this place doesnt have problems if you slur your order :)

I always get the jumbo hotdog and the cake shake. Man, they put a cake in that shake. and its good cake. I also give props to the lovely lady who calls out my order number. she makes things rhyme and doesn't mind if you try to sing along with her or rhyme with her. Yea, she cool. I also highly recommend the burgers. I love all the interior decor, they have some cool stuff in there, and also, lots of Chicago history. I highly recommend this place to stop by as you're walking around.",1
303,"Portillo's is a good staple of chicago food and the surrounding areas. It's not just their hot dogs that are good, but their burgers and sandwiches as well. I prefer the onion rings to their fries.

The biggest downside I've experienced is a long wait for food and inadequate seating.",1
304,"Great Chicago Dog, Italian Beef was good. Atmosphere is kinda loud but ok. You go in and order and wait for your number to be called. If you want a beer in a frosted glass your order from the bar separately. The workers were the rudest though. They yelled at one of my friends. We had never been there and just asked a few questions because we didn't know a few things. Go for the food not for anything else. I gave it 5 stars ONLY for the Dog, otherwise it would be much less.",1
305,"Good food. Service can be spotty. It's one of those cornerstone places in Chicago, especially for first time visitors to the city. I've lived in the city for about 6 years now and it's still one of my favorite places to pop in for a good burger for lunch or fries and a milkshake to snack on during my commute home.",1
306,"This rambunctious cafeteria-style food hall has all the Chicago delicacies in one place. Thought about a hot dog, but went for the Italian beef which was to-die-for. I could've eaten three. Staff have the best attitude I've seen of a fast-food place.",1
307,"The establishment itself is nice but it took a long time to get my food. Food is okay, burger was decent but the hot dog felt like it was sitting out for a while (bun was very soggy unfortunately)",1
308,I never paid $22 for 2 hotdogs and fries but I will say it was well worth it! My love & I enjoyed them! It was really delicious 😋😍,1
309,"A must visit when you're in the city. Great food and awesome atmosphere. It gets very busy sometimes, but you can order online ahead of time.",1
310,"What can you say about Portillo's that hasn't already been said?  Probably not much..
They have the BEST chili dog with cheese I've ever had..  Great onion rings.. Good, hearty soups, broiled chicken sandwich is great, and I add cheddar cheese and honey mustard sauce.  Great overall American food at a good price.",1
311,"This place is very, very good! I was impressed with the way the employees came around to the tables and spoke with the guests. A tip is that there are three lines, usually two will be fairly long while one is generally shorter. All lines serve all foods, so don't worry about jumping into the shorter line.",1
312,Portillo's is a must if you want to experience some of the best common man Chicago cuisine. I personally recommend you get the Italian beef dipped with hot peppers. The fries are delicious as are the onion rings and malts. I can also confirm the Italian strawberry shortcake IS something to wrote home about.,1
313,"OMG... All my friends from Chicago said I had to get my Chicago to hot dog from Portillo's as well as the Italian beef, oh and don't forget the chocolate cake milkshake. All were absolutely off the charts and I ate more hot dogs and I've ever eaten in my entire life during the week that I was in Chicago! I happily own every one of those calories!",1
314,The jumbo dog and chocolate cake are worth writing home about. The most refreshing Coke on tap anywhere. A lot of the food isn't great but also not bad. Can recommend the salads and rustic pasta. Loud and typically pretty crowded.,1
315,Loved it! Fantastic Italian beef,1
316,"This is probably the most unorganized, confusing, and utterly ridiculous place I've ever been. The lines make no sense. It's impossible to get to certain ones. The chaotic atmosphere makes it hard to focus (for me anyway). And you have to wade through other customers who are all rude.

And after all that....the food is mediocre. It's not terrible, but it's not great. I probably won't come here again.",0
317,"This place is crazy! From the look of the outside, I expected a regular restaurant but no, it's a mad house! We were there on a Friday evening, one of the busiest times I imagine. I had no idea what the deal was or how to work out what to do order. There were these huge lines up to a bunch of different counters but the lines moved fairly quickly so I had hardly any time to work out what to order. The hot dog I ended up with was okay, nothing special. I wish I'd just copied what my friends had as it looked good - chop salad and ribs with garlic bread. I tried or get a cup of water at the bar and they waved me to one side like I was supposed to order it elsewhere. Really weird. I ended up asking my friend to get it. The people taking orders seemed nice enough but some of them were just so busy they couldn't engage and if you didn't know the place inside out, you were overlooked. A bit intimidating!
Strange place but I haven't given up, I'd go back if I had the chance.",1
318,"Ok, so first, the positives. Overall, this place is legit. You can tell it's a Chicago staple by the deco and the menu. The food is very fairly priced, and the flavor is outstanding. Had the hot dog, because you have to really, and it was great. That said, presentation was not. I know, it's a hot dog joint, but it's also a restaurant and chicago classic. Also, my bread was soggy too the point of dissolving. Not sure if this is a house rule or exception, but it happened. Bathrooms were clean, great family vibe, and overall good experience. Would go again to try different menu items.",1
319,"Thought this was just a hot dog restaurant but offers a great variety of different foods, drinks and desserts. Though I would go for the hot dogs as it is a Chicago staple. The staff is friendly and quick. To spped up the process, make sure you know what you want ad they take your order while waiting in line.  The chili dog is my go to but their is excellent so you cannot go wrong.",1
320,"I really hate to write this because I love this place, but tonight the service and food were both terrible. First, they refused to honor the 1/2 priced happy hour (2-5pm) promotion (rudely, I might add), then after driving home I notice the bread missing and ribs were absolutely doused in so much bbq sauce it made the ribs gross. Even after wiping spoonfuls of the sauce away, they still were not what I've had in the past. Really disappointed by this experience.",0
321,"Where's the beef? It's at Portillo's! The hotdogs are fine, but the real action is with a beef or big beef sandwich. Dipped is too soggy for me, but do get some gravy on it. Also get mozzarella cheese, not the cheese sauce. And Don't forget peppers too! Wash it down with a local draft brew, and you are having some of the finest that Chicago has to offer.",1
322,"If you have to visit one place while visiting Chicago, it should definitely be Portillo's. Despite how long the lines can get, they move quickly and you get the food amazingly fast (and they never mess up an order). Counter service lacks slightly, but the food makes up for it. Their Italian beef sandwiches (smothered in gravy) is to die for. It's juicy, tender, warm, and delicious. Their fries and hot dogs are also easy to rave about. Portillo's is a Chicago classic, and a must-go place your agenda.",1
323,"Great Italian beef sandwich! I was referred here by my lyft driver and it delivered! My friend got the hot dog which she said tasted amazing but it was just small, so order 2 if you are hungry. It was a little confusing coming in and ordering, but you can order at any food station and there is one food pickup location. The fries were just okay, but you are coming for the Italian beef sandwich or hot dog anyways right!",1
324,Great Chicago dogs. Well worth the visit.,1
325,"Fantastic food. Stick to their specialities. Burgers looked big, but the dogs and sausages are amazing. Service is quick, beer is cold and seating is tight. Awesome atmosphere and not overly touristy.",1
326,"Although I understand that since this location is in the middle of downtown, I know not to expect my order ready in 5 mins. I had already been waiting over 30 mins when I decided to check for an update. The employee wasn’t able to find my bag and once they did, the look on their face said “shit”. My bag was just lying there and hadn’t been started. I got my refund faster than I got my food. I spoke highly of this food chain and was my go to until now. Won’t be returning.",0
327,"This place was recommended to me by everyone for great places to eat in Chicago. I do not get the hype at all. I ordered the Portillos dog and cheese fries with a drink. The  pickle was larger than the hot dog, which I could barely taste. I've had better Chicago style dogs in Denver. The cheese sauce for the fries tasted like it came from a can and the fries were glorified bagged crinkle fries.

As for the service, the worst. The cashier was just plain rude. When they called my number, the lady handed me my bag of food and just stared at me. I asked for my drink and she turned to the drink girl and asked for my tea without even looking at my ticket. She obviously knew it was missing. The drink girl made 3 other drinks that sat there before i finally had to ask again for my drink. If you call my number, then my order should be ready. It's not hard to make an iced tea.

When I sat down with my food, I realized everyone around me had their food on plates. I was never asked if I wanted my for here or to go. Honestly, if the food would have been good, I could have overlooked the poor service. Not one thing impressed me. Must just be good childhood memories from those that suggested it.",0
328,"This is my favorite Italian Beef in Chicago. The line was huge but don't worry it goes fast. I must say their Chocolate Cake Milk Shake is soooo gooood! Our daughter had the Grilled Chicken Cesar Salad and found it to far exceed my expectations, however the Hotdogs and Italian Beef are the Stars of the Show.",1
329,"I am a frequent patron of this restaurant. The food and the service were once really good. But my last few visits have left me very unhappy because I either received the wrong order or an incomplete order. Tonight  10/9/18 was my last visit and as usual I ordered an Italian Beef dipped with hot peppers and a double bacon cheese burger.The amount of meat put on the Italian Beef was minuscule. The average Italian Beef has 90% more meat on it than the one I received tonight and to make matters worse the Beef sandwich was not dipped and it was loaded with far too many hot pepper; I guess to accommodate for the lack of meat.Unfortunately, like always I was not aware of the problem until I got home. After tonight I will not be back. I use to come here because the food was amazing and I always felt like it was money well spent but that is no longer the case. It seems that I can not even get what I paid for anymore. Money absolutely wasted",0
330,"Not bad, had a spicy chicken.  The chicken was good, the bun was a bit generic.",1
331,OMGException! I liked that food! Delicious! I could not prevent myself to walk me there again in 4 days visit to Chicago! I fell in love with Mama-T. She is so cute and generous. I liked the atmosphere and of course the second floor! It was a great experience for the whole family!,1
332,"The burger, shake, and cheese fries were excellent! The wait was not too bad (10min) for the amount of people coming through.",1
333,Food was fine. Lines were fine but could be more efficient. But PLEASE Portillo’s: adopt a “no holding tables” policy when you’re busy. I got my food and then waited 15 minutes on a table to open up before deciding to just leave and take my food to go. At least HALF of the tables on both levels were taken by people with no food yet. I’ll go to a different hot dog joint next time.,0
334,I was thinking that hot dog is a hot dog. How different could it be? And boy I was wrong! This place is total blast. With all the details on the walls (like original Bulls and Blackhawks logos) and that hot dog. THAT hot dog. It is simply amazing. At least ask for 2 and prepare to wait a bit. Definitely a must visit point in Chicago.,1
335,"I considered writing a one-word review: Meh.

I admit I was excited about this place - hoping it was going to be the holy grail of Chicago hot dog joints, as it was sold to me by hotel staff, star ratings and a friendly lady I met during the Kimpton Palomar “wine hour” who assured me it was the real deal. The Italian beef sandwich was recommended to me by both her and my cashier. Sadly it was a soggy flavourless mess.

Nice neon and olde worlde jazz to eat a soggy flavourless mess to though.",0
336,"Being from Texas I’ve never even considered tomatoes on a hotdog or that ketchup would be an offense. Portillo’s nails it the the best buns and diverse toppings I’ve ever tried that cake together incredibly well! The chocolate cake shake has a ton of cake in the bottom so be sure to use a spoon. 🤤

Can’t wait to come back for seconds!",1
337,"An awesome Chicago experience. If you’re visiting the city, I’d suggest visiting as they have an awesome storefront with a bunch of Chicago themed decorations inside. The burgers are good, as well as the Italian food. Their chocolate cake is heavenly, as well as their lemon cake when it’s available.",1
338,"The food was pretty good for a hotdog.

But the service and the way you order is APPALLING. The only reason it is getting 2 stars is because the food wasn’t terrible and the restaurant was clean.

Maybe it’s a local sort of thing but a person standing there taking your order before you can even see the menu and then being rude when you don’t know your order immediately. And the person at the register was equally or more rude when I said I wasn’t able to find out earlier so give me a second.

The people who gave you the order at the pickup spot were fun and nice also one of the other reasons it has a second star.

I will probably never return based upon this and the hotdog was good but I got one equally as good at a little hotdog stand by the field museum...not worth returning here for the hassle or price.",0
339,"We ordered jumbo dogs... But there was nothing jumbo about it! It was like the size that I get from my local grocery store, But it was really good!",1
340,"Very busy atmosphere, was surprised how fast the ordering went despite the queue we waited in",1
341,"Four stars only because the wait here can be really bad. We went on a Sunday morning and the line was to the door. The cashiers did the best they could to make things move quickly, but it still took a very long time. But the food is good quality, and the restaurant was clean. A Chicago staple!",1
342,"The Italian sandwich has an abundance of beef and is very tasty! The hotdog was delicious! My friend and I split both so that we could taste each one. If you are only going to have the hotdog, I recommend ordering two of them as they are quite small. We had fries and onion rings to share and both were good, but I have to say that the onion rings were delicious!",1
343,"The service was swift, friendly, and helpful! Staff had a good attitude, the high volume was handled very well, I did hit a cone so if you're uncomfortable with tight drive thrus I do not recommend. Great food as always of course ☺️",1
344,Ordering line is long but moved quickly. Pickup area on the other hand is a complete cluster. Really good food. Worth the trouble.,1
345,"I feel like Portillos isn’t as good as it once was - maybe they are getting the hot dogs from a different vendor.  Anyway, food is still decent. It does agitate me how difficult it is to use the elevator due to so many employees using it versus saving it for patrons. When traveling about the city with strollers you are really at the mercy of those elevators!",1
346,"Fast food with great taste and value. The inside looks like museum. You'll be entertained while waiting for the food. Variety menu, known for Chicago hotdogs and beef. Also, find Italian pizza and pasta, not to mention a variety of other choices. Don't miss it while visiting Chicago. Has a Children's menu, and a car drive- thru. Can handle large groups. Handicap accessible.",1
347,"Delicious itialian beef sandwiches, burgers, and fries!",1
348,"Went midday on Thursday before I flew out. Good place for a quick, casual, and affordable bite. Line moves quickly. They serve beer in big goblets. The ""jumbo"" hot dog was plump but didn't seem big at all. Note: My friend got a veggie dog and it was, comically, a pickle and veggies lining a hot dog bun. The chocolate cake is to die for- moist and rich. MUST try. They even make it into a milkshake. Big beef and chili cheese dog hit the spot, too.",1
349,Cute place!! Hot dogs are not bad,1
350,Food was great but service was horrible. We waited over 45 minutes for our food. We asked several times about our order and people acted like they didn’t know what was going on.,0
351,I got chocolate cake shake. This right there is by far one of the best shakes I've had in my life. Plus theirs a piece of cake at the bottom of the shake. When I saw this on whatever TV show it was I honestly forgot about it while in Chicago but I will definitely return to Chi Town to have another shake. Soooooo frickin gooooooodd!,1
352,"Although it has an interesting decor and a wide variety of options I didn't think the food was better than at the fast food place nextdoor and the evening that I visited the people working here were rather grumpy (possibly because of the rain). My co worker was satisfied with his hot dog and beer, though, so I may just have ordered the wrong thing.",1
353,"This was a horrible experience for our first time being in Chicago today at 11:00am!  We decided to try this place out, we were not impressed at all with one of the employees working there! I shouldn't even give this restaurant a 1 star even but had to. First off, we asked for mountain dew and two gals on staff just laughed at us as if we were supposed to know that they didn't have that. Secondly, THE MOST important part of this worst customer service experience is this:  I was going to pay for 2 out of the 4 orders, I told the lady this and she literally huffed and puffed at me rolling her eyes..very rude as if it was such a hard thing to do! I work customer service at my job and I could even do better service than what we had received today. Another thing, when our food was ready they forgot fries from our order. It was very poor service,  employees reacted very rudely there to make this a bad experience for us all. Although,  I will say the hot dog we all thought was very good. Just an overall bad experience because of the rude employees!!",0
354,"I love Portillos, and this place serves the same great food. However, their menu is slightly limited compared to other locations and the staff can be testy. I've never seen them yell at a customer, but I've witnessed several arguments between staff and one meltdown behind the counter.

The restaurant itself is pretty cool inside, but seating is an issue if you're there at a normal eating hour. Find a seat when you come in before ordering so you aren't holding your food waiting for people to leave.",1
355,"This is one of the places I go to every time I come to Chicago.  I always get the Italian beef sandwich.  It's tasty and the peppers on top are great.  I also got the chocolate cake shake since I've never got it before.  That was a mistake.  It was so heavy since they actually put cake crumbs in the shake.  Next time, I'll just get the Italian beef sandwich and that's all my stomach can handle.",1
356,Very confusing and very busy for first timers. The food is pretty good but its too loud and its always super busy. Couldn't hear when my order was called. Only thing that saved this from a lower rating was the chocolate cake shake. But that was still super thick. Basically a meal in itself.,1
357,"This is literally the most overrated place. All the food is simply terrible. Unhealthy, bad quality. I’m not sure why people come to this place. Only explanation that is cheap.

So disgusting, it’s like people in Chicago just follow the crowd and because everyone comes here, they think is good. If you are not a native, so not waste your time coming here.

The chocolate cake shake is terrible as well.",0
358,"This is a great place! The Italian Beef Combination with hot peppers is one of the best ever. Add the crinkle cut fries with cheese and you are set!  Also, if you have a sweet tooth, try the chocolate cake shake. Yeah you read that right.",1
359,"What a joke. The Italian beef was just beef no garnish like they said and the hot dog was missing half of the toppings. They had a mess at the pick up counter, couldn't  get anybody drinks, he kept calling out numbers for orders that were ready, but no drinks, wrong drinks, people were just walking away without. Couldn't  get anybody to get me an iced tea, stood there 10 minutes with my food soaking through the bag. Amateurs at best. Food was ok, would have been better if it had everything on them that they should have. There's  better places in Chicago to get Italian beef and Chicago dogs, don't waste your time.",0
360,I am an Italian Beef fanatic and love Italian Beefs. One of my favorite sandwiches. Went to Portllios a couple of nights ago. One of my two favorite places to get them. Sandwiches were not as flavorful or hot as they normally. Will give them another shot next time in town.,1
361,It’s a classic. Enjoyed the beef extra spicy. Drive through took very long. They were having staffing issues to it makes sense.,1
362,"Unbelievably inconsistent, two identical orders will turn out with completely different levels of gravy. Sometimes the meat will be flavorless and dry despite the bread surrounding it being mush with gravy.",0
363,I went to Portillo's a few years ago visiting Chicago with a friend. She brought me around sightseeing and brought me to this place. This place is the best! I had the Italian beef and Italian sausage. This was the best thing ever. I even came back home to Atlanta and ordered one of their kits online to make at home. Loved it!,1
364,"Hot dogs were good, was not a fan of the famous beef sandwich though, just a soggy roll full of low quality ""beef"". While the hot dogs were decent there are a hundred little Chicago dog places that are just as good and this place is far more chaotic and crowded than the others.",1
365,"This was my first time trying Portillo's. I had the hot dog, with fries and the Chocolate Cake Shake. The food was very tasty and service was quick. The Chocolate Cake Shake was like nothing I've ever tried (Fluffy the comedian gives a great illustration in his Chicago show on Netflix). I will be back to Portillo's.",1
366,"Ive been too many Portillos in my 23 years of living in Chicago, but this ones by far at the bottom of the totem pole.
Everytime I order from them, they get something wrong whether its forgotten fries or runny shakes. The patio staff are nice as they usually are, but whoevers on the line is really out of their game.",0
367,"Italian beef and chicago style hot dogs are off the chain! Old school and traditional meet when you place your order and see the varieties and options of sandwiches,dogs, and entrees all made from scratch right in front of you and they yell out your order number you know your in for a classic. Prices were dirt cheap and the wait wasn't terrible but could be at their most busiest time.(lunch rush,nighttime) I will be coming back to Portillo's anytime I visit Chicago because I believe Portillo's is truly a staple of Chicago style dining!",1
368,This particular Barnelli's makes the worst pastas I ever had. I never have these undercooked and tasteless pastas except for when I decide to eat downtown.,0
369,Great food. Loved the beef and sausage combo.,1
370,"I love this restaurant due its history and popularity, atmosphere and design. It's a perfect place for those who knows the menu by heart. But being first times there it's not really pleasant, as there are always lots of people, looong rows, and when comes your turn you have few seconds to tell your choice, and not knowing the menu, it takes a little time, which makes the staff a little impatient and you feel uncomfortable.",1
371,This place is extremely busy at peak lunch and dinner times.  There is no convenient free parking nearby.   It's best to go by foot.  Surprisingly the chocolate cake is delicious.  Chicago dogs are excellent with a burger or Italian beef on the side.,1
372,Slowest drive thru ever! I'm actually gonna need all the extra calories after wasting away in boredom. Worst part is they take your money right away and then you get trapped.,0
373,The dogs we tried and the beef sandwich were okay. The only thing that caught my palette's attention was the cake shake!,1
374,The manger is very professional and welcoming Mr TOM he is all over the place looking after his employees what a great leader I hope his upper management will appreciate his efforts. Definitely recommend.,1
375,"First time ever having Portillo's. Being from out of state, I can say that it's very good! I've tried their Portillo's dog and the Italian beef. Both were great! Italian beef would be my choice next time I'm back.",1
376,"Italian beef was very tasty, but maybe not the stuff of legend. Maybe it was just bad timing (10:00 at night) but I think I got all of the juice from the giardiniera, great flavor but almost too spicy to eat, and I like spicy.",1
377,"The food there was incredible and the design of the restaurant shows Chicago through the years which makes it a great time. The food is delicious, but a little pricey. Its cool how they have different lines depending on what you want and their malts are to die for.",1
378,"Despite the fact that this place is extremely busy, your food still comes out quick and tastes good. Although both hot dogs I ordered were overcooked because the ""casing"" kept coming off which made it hard to chew.",1
379,"So incredibly busy. As a traveler, the system for ordering and getting food is hard to understand, so give yourself some extra time. Food was pretty good, especially the Polish sausage and milkshake! Definitely glad we made this stop!",1
380,I absolutely love this place there Italian beef sandwich dipped with sweet peppers is a Chicago original! I also love the chop salad and the chocolate cake is pretty good too. This is a must have when you come to Chicago,1
381,All the way from GA to get an Italian beef..,1
382,"Happened to stumble upon this place while walking around my hotel looking for a quick bite to eat.   Glad I did, because I will be back here every single time I am back in Chicago for work.    I had the Italian Beef and Italian Sausage combo sandwich.   It was one of the most delicious sandwiches I've had.   The staff was also very efficient and friendly.    My only complaint is the fries are a little unimaginative.   I would think they could make it even that much better by doing something like fresh hand-cut fries......like Penn Stations.",1
383,Came here for the chocolate cake shake but the lines were so huge that it took us 30 mins to order and another 10 mins to get the order. The shake was really good.,1
384,"If you’re visiting from out of town, PLEASE stop here. It lives up to the hype in every way. Get whatever you want, it’s all good. Only tough part is parking, but again it’s worth every bit of hassle. The Italian Beef is God-tier. And the chocolate cake shake is divine.",1
385,"We were expecting the hot dogs to steal the show…they were good! But the salad, best I’ve ever had in my life!",1
386,"This has one of the best hotdogs in Chicago, and very filling too.  It has a huge menu, I love the decor, and the location is close enough to the subway line.  I wish I can try everything, but the calaory count that is listed scares me.  It is hard to justify a 1000 plus calory milkshake, but I do appreciate the health warning.",1
387,Polish dog was great. Regular dog just so so,1
388,"You can't go wrong with Portillo's. What they offer is made well, and it looks and tastes like you want it to.",1
389,"Meh ... there's always something wrong or missing when I eat at Portillo's. I have only eaten on site once, visitors request. I can't imagine how they knew about Portillo's. The Italian Beef was tasty, not extraordinary. Only time I have had one.",1
390,"Tasty, I walk in great atmosphere,  but the Prep people's didn't read  the details orders how I like my food,  I like my beef triple dip and got home to the Southside and it was dry.  Cashiers/prep peoples, please listen to details please. If not I will not come that Portillo's again. They where so busy talking among themselves and forgot they where at work,  because I'm listening to them . Stay focused,  I like coming there.",0
391,"Great dog, soaked with chili and cheese. Crispy onion rings. And people watching for days. Nom nom nom.",1
392,"Although a pure tourist stop, Portillo's has a great ordering set up and fantastic Italian Beef  (not Meat) Sandwiches. I prefer it dry with no peppers and a traditional (Chicago) topped hot dog on the side.
The french fries are okay. I usually get the Onion rings and a bowl of Chili (excellent) instead.
This location usually has a police presence at night so that is a plus.
The drive thru is ALWAYS busy so walking in and ordering is your best bet when visiting this location.",1
393,"Do not go at lunch time. Had to experience Chicago hot dog, but one guest wanted the croissant sandwich,  got a hot dog with no dog, horrible. Took 45 minutes for 2 hot dogs. The atmosphere was chaotic, unprofessional.",1
394,Sad that they no longer carry the grilled tuna! Why do the healthiest options disappear! Get it together Americans! Well at least I’ll always love their fries. Hope they never stop serving those,1
395,"Local chain serving great hot dogs and a full menu of other items. They have a number of locations, and this one is the epicenter of tourists., everything on the menu is good,  the chocolate cake is to die for. It's worth the ambient noise and the somewhat confused clientele who have never been there before to get a great sandwich and a hunk of that cake.",1
396,"If you don't already, the best restaurant in the country. Beef is the best you'll find on the menu and in Chicago. Flame Grilled burgers are the juiciest burgers around. Hot Dogs do the job. Chop Chicken salad is the only salad I know most people eat. If you've not filled up on the food, then their Chocolate Cake is unreal. BEST FOOD EXPERIENCE IN CHICAGO.",1
397,Easy way to check off your Chicago cuisine must eats!,1
398,"Excellent! Best dog I have ever had, and Italian  beef sandwich was so incredible it defies words to describe it. The entire experience was made by one very special person, Mama T, who helped us with ordering and made the visit ao much fun!",1
399,"When you walk in it can be a bit intimidating and overwhelming. You’ll need to know what you’re getting beforehand so you’re ready. So I recommend speaking with the locals first or talking to someone who’s been to Chicago before. They’re famous for their “Chicago Style” hot dogs which is fashioned with onions, relish, tomatoes and one big pickle. Their chocolate cake is favored as well. Stop by if you want something fast and that’s a local favorite of the city.",1
400,"Hot dog was good. Then there is the ""black Friday"" feel when everyone is waiting for their order and the employees are huddling everyone up tighter and tighter to over-anxiously get the orders! Not what u expected when I walked in but a huge cold beer and good dog is actually making me rethink the 3 star to a 4... Eh, maybe next time.",1
401,"We were there on a Saturday and it was crazy busy but run efficiently. We had been told they had the best Chicago style hotdogs and it was a good dog but not the best I've ever had. Cute old building, hard to find a table, for some reason they had the 2nd floor closed. I probably wouldn't go back but only because of how crowded it was.",1
402,"Neat looking place, thought it’d be a great late night place to eat. The set up is confusing and was a madhouse at 12:30am on a Saturday night. My wife had a question about a menu item and the employees were rude and not helpful. She asked what the “side pasta” which we didn’t think was a difficult question. Guess it was. Ended going to McDonalds across the street.",0
403,"Food ok, it is an absolute mess for service though. Our order never came up after 50 minutes. The employee said she ""ain't got that order here yet"" finally a manager, I guess, helped us. Our food hadn't been made, so she told someone to do it. She gave us our bag finally, but the drinks were just a big of a mess as the food. The 2 trashcan near where we were sitting were overflowing onto the floor. The chili cheese dog had no cheese on it. The beef sandwich was dry.",0
404,Service was great!! Food was meh..,1
405,"Slowest Portillos in chicago honestly. Took over 30 minutes for two shakes in the drive through. If I had the option to give it zero stars I would. I don’t write reviews at ALL, but I definitely had to write one for this slow place. It’s not the first time I had dealt with this, there was another occasion last year, but like I said I don’t write reviews at all. Definitely wouldn’t recommend. Highly disappointed.",0
406,The wife and myself had a very nice experience at Portillo's while we were in Chicago.,1
407,"Nice place to eat, they space out the tables and they have some great choices in the menu, their chocolate cake shake is amazing, but will make you very sluggish. Overall great place to eat.",1
408,This place is cool looking as you walk in the door. It has very tasty steamed hot dogs. No boiling in water here. Also has a nice variety or other foods. We got Hot Dogs and fries. Definitely recommend.,1
409,A bastion of Chicago food. I love this place and come here everytime I am in town. They have great hot dogs and sliced beef sandwiches. Their ribs are also good. Their burgers are just ok as well as their margaritas. The best part is it only costs 10 bucks to eat here,1
410,"Not as nice as some of the other Portillo’s. Fairly typical experience except minus 1 star for: SLOW service, just barely warm fries, and a chocolate shake that only had 1 pump of chocolate in it, if that. I would rate it even lower if the staff were not so pleasant and the actual flavor of the food weren’t good.",1
411,"Very good food.  The atmosphere is pretty good too.  For non local travellers, however the entire ordering process is a mess.  Multiple lines going the same place, lots of different areas to buy food then grab a beer, lots of lines everywhere.  Then picking up food...people just won't move.  And then the employees...yelling, flirting, just a bad experience.  Hopefully it is not like that all the time.",1
412,Best dogs ever great atmosphere,1
413,Food was good they didn't repeat our order so didn't know our fries weren't ordered until we got our food and left. My beef sandwich was dipped when I only wanted a little extra gravy and the bag was ripped when we got out food. Why wouldn't u double bag a bag if it was ripped? I got out of my car and the whole bag came apart luckily was holding the food so it didn't fall on the ground. Good food bad workers,1
414,"There are locations all over, but this is the ""flagship"", if you will, location. Food hall style that will be crowded with lines, but also the biggest selection as they have Italian food and ribs, in addition to the hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. Definitely the touristy location, but kinda cool atmosphere and worth going to at least once.

Food is the same as other locations. Have a frozen custard with your Chicago dog.",1
415,"Portillo's is everything you want at a burger / dog / sandwich joint.  Atmosphere is way fun with creative decorations.  Food is very tasty and not over priced.   I went out of my way just to eat there with my two sons, that says a lot.",1
416,"CRAZY!  I could not believe the line up in this place.  I had ""the Polish"" which was really good.  However it was so busy in there that things were chaotic and orders were getting messed up.   I had to wait for my lemonade and had to chase down the piece of chocolate cake I ordered.  Everyone recommended the chocolate cake; I found it tasted just like a mccains deep and delicious cake you can buy at the grocery store. Worth a visit tho just for the atmosphere and definitely try ""the Polish""",1
417,"Food was good but waited almost an hour for my order. They just skipped the order and then got mad when I kept inquiring where it was. 45 minutes in the manager finally took my receipt and said ""oh...you placed your order 45 minutes ago?  Hold on"". Then it took another 10 minutes to gather 5 hot dogs, a fry, and 2 drinks. Oh...and after that, they forgot something on my order which made me have to go back up and complain to which the manager got pissy with me. The only reason they got a 2 was because the food was good, but not worth waiting an hour.",0
418,Chocolate cake shake!! Delightful.  Sausage and pepper sandwich and French fries delicious and ready quickly. Great atmosphere detailing some of  Chicago's history. Great food and a fun place to eat.,1
419,It is a Chicago must go place. Their Italian beef is the best in Chicago. I am also in love with their choclate  cake which is why I this place is one of my favourites in the Windy City. Go there grab an Italian beef and I promise you would not disappointed.,1
420,The hot dog was not as good as  Everyone said it would be! But the ribs were pretty Good. Not very flavorful not very tender. I won't be going again by at least the  Natives like it.,0
421,You have to come here when visiting. The Chicago dog and Italian beef were incredible. Will definitely visit again when in Chicago.,1
422,"We came here twice on our 4 day stay in the City because it was such a good lunch. The food was great, especially considering the price. The atmosphere is very cool. Very well run operation - clean and a huge amount of menu options.

I am jealous of those who work nearby.",1
423,Best hot dogs and the ribs are to die for 😱,1
424,I’ve heard good things about the place but was unable to get any food. They said it closed at 12am online. The door said 2am we got there a little before 11pm and refused service . Which was a bummer we wanted to end our last night in Chicago here.,0
425,"Im here for a Convention and kept hearing about this place. The food was okay but what made the wait worth it was the staff. I traveled to Chicago for a convention alone and was a bit worried when I walked in. The place was crowded with people and seating was scarce. I searched hi and low for a table and was about to give up when one of the staff asked me how I was doing and helped me. They found seating for me in seconds(theres a hidden spot). I was grateful!!! The staff were all wonderful, even when some of the customers were jerks. I wouldve been fired had it been me!!!",1
426,"Good, fast, and reasonably priced. Loved it! The cake milkshakes were amazing! Would totally go back. Highly recommend.",1
427,"Great food, horrible service at this location.  We waited 25 minutes for a burger that was missing a topping and a polish and onion rings. All the young kids working in the back were arguing with each other and rolling their eyes most of the time. At a high volume location you'd think they would have more experienced and semi friendly staff.",0
428,Every time I go to Chicago I have to stop in Portillo's and grab a Dog!,1
429,"It doesn't get any better than this.  My favorite Italian Beef and hot dogs in the city, and this location is easily accessible from the hotels I frequent during business trips to the River North area.  Get a great, authentic Chicago style meal for a super cheap price!",1
430,Best hot dog I've ever had. The peppers were pretty spicy but still amazing. All the talk of the Chicago style hot dog did not let me down. Portillos does it right. Loved it.,1
431,Hot dogs nothing to brag about. Person handing out orders did not seem to want to be there. Realized it is hard to get workers.,1
432,"Looking for Chicago Style Hotdogs and fantastic shakes?! This is the place to be. Very inexpensive and great, exciting environment for everyone to gaze at decor and the hard working staff. Very good food, and the shakes were awesome.",1
433,"Guys, this is the original home for the Chicago dog.  There is something special about the steamed bun, hot dog, and the garden..lol.  The tastes just have a special blend that cannot be beat.
We also heard about the burgers and the Italian beef that comes close to the original, Al's.
The reviews were definitely in Portillo's favor.",1
434,I visited here while at a conference in Chicago. I had not eaten a Chicago style hot dog prior to this visit. I was pleasantly surprised that the poppy seed bun with all the toppings actually blended well together. Portillos is busy but has a seamless system to navigate through the lines and get your food. The food was tasty and well worth the trip.,1
435,"The regular Chicago style was ok. I didn't add anything to it other than the normal Chicago style toppings, but could have used mustard and ketchup. The fries were great, and the atmosphere is really cool.",1
436,Famous place that do a great veggie dog!,1
437,"Not worth the walk or the cab ride. Shouldn't be considered a place that represents Chicago. The place was disorganized (no signs for where the lines were) and the food was sloppy. Onion rings were too crispy, shake was too thick to drink through a straw and the hot dog toppings were all over. Gross! Go to a gas station for a hot dog (they make better ones)! That place is over charging everyone.",0
438,"They are doing their best to accommodate orders but seemed to busy and forgot three items from my carryout order. By the time I realized that my order was incomplete I was already home. Every attempt to reach anyone by phone resulted in the phone disconnecting the line. Very frustrating and feel a bit cheated. Otherwise, food is good and is a staple here in the city.",1
439,Good Chicago dog and service was good!,1
440,Good tasting dogs and beef sandwiches. Just can't get over the long wait times whenever I visit (even before the lunch hour rush). Sometimes you'll see folks order after you and they get their food before you do. Nothing complicated about making a hotdog or beef sandwich.,1
441,"Only did the one star so I could leave this review. Food was good. However, when we got up to leave, my wife noticed her purse was open and wallet was missing. Manager pulled video footage and showed 2 gentlemen without any food sit down behind us and watched it happen. Stressful and sad. Was visiting from Boston and was recommended by friend. They have security on-site. But, he was sitting behind a table as soon as you walk in and not actively patrolling the premises. Visitors beware. Posting this in hopes this doesn’t happen to anyone else.",0
442,"I heard the hype, so I tried it. I've had better Italian beefs. But the chocolate cake shake was good though. Its not my top priority of places to return to eat again any time soon. Maybe a quick stop for a shake",1
443,This place was delicious... its a little chaotic inside but uts simple. The dogs were tasty and the service was good.,1
444,"My burger was great, hubby's Italian beef was good too. But the fries were perfect! If it weren't for the long lines, if visit everyday for those fries.",1
445,"Good,  but for all it's raved about I didn't really think it was all that. Definitely a great place to eat at, the environment is awesome. There's a lot of memorabilia and collectibles around that make the place look really cool. And the food is good I just wouldn't say it's like the best in the city.",1
446,Someone highly recommended me to try this place on a recent trip to the area. Sandwiches were very good and service was quick. I highly recommend the chocolate cake shake. It's a shake with a piece of chocolate cake blended into it. Visted here 3 times in a week before heading back home because the food was so good.,1
447,"I love going to Portillo's...I call it my treat to myself! I really like the hot dog with chili, cheese and onions AND the grilled chicken sandwich. I also enjoy the fries and shakes. Service is great. By the way, NEVER forget to get the chocolate cake. Its the best you will EVER find...really...its better than my moms or grandmothers.",1
448,"A Classic Favorite for Great Hot Dogs.
This is an institution here in Chicago. Their hot dogs are filled with delicious ingredients including a sour pickle. Fries are great too! The menu is wide and varied if hot dogs are not your thing.",1
449,Best hot dogs I've ever had.,1
450,"The interior looks amazing !!!!! The most impressive looking restaurant I have been in-I just couldn’t stop staring. The food was also great, especially their fries...I will definitely be back!",1
451,"This place is so logistically challenged it's funny.  There are like 5 lines - one for hot dogs, one for burgers, etc.  The hot dog line had a sign that said form two lines. Except it didnt - after  about 10 minute ts they said that the second line was closed.  So all those people joined one line. Net result 20 minute wait to order hotdogs.

Then you wait on another ""line"" to get your food. There I waited 25 minutes for 2 hot dogs.  It's like chaos as they call out random numbers is no particular order.  Half the time they seem confused as orders are messed up.

By the time I got the hot dog I was don . Plus it was cold and the charred polish was dry and overcooked.

So, other than getting a good laugh at the place's operational ineptitude, its avoid at all costs.",0
452,"I had a wedding in Chicago to go to, and the rehearsal dinner was held in the upstairs area.  It was surprisingly good considering it's a fast food/drive through place as well.  All the food was delicious considering the style.  I knocked off one star because they ran out of Fat Tire beer.  I'm not a fan of very light beers but I had to settle for it.  They ran out of Fat Tire the night before, and had not replenished it the next day according to the bartender.  If you only have 4 beers on tap, I don't think you should run out of any of the options especially since you're not even a bar.",1
453,"Love the burgers, fries, beef, and dogs.   Can get very busy!",1
454,The hotdog was great but the Italian beef sandwich was horrible,1
455,"Downtown location is still the same as it should be. Fast drive through service on Saturday for lunch. Mid week I see lines around the corner but looks to move fast. Chicago institution for decades now. Beef and cheddar croissant, chicago-style hot dogs, beef and sausage combo, great burgers and much more. Not sure I've ever had a bad experience at any Portillos. Corporate owned these days has affected the ginormous Chicago portion sizes to standard portions of beef, fries and few other Bernellies options.",1
456,"The food tastes great, our hotdogs were just super squished. Could've been prepped better. I'd still go back though. Atmosphere was super cute and reasonably priced.",1
457,"Such a cool interior, and the employees are really fantastic. You have to try the Chicago style hot dog or Italian meat sandwich! And the chocolate cake shake is to die for.",1
458,"On our visit to Chicago we had to famous wind city cuisine and the dogs are part of that tapestry. One bite and we were addicted. Seriously the best dogs in town and the best ""Chicago dogs"" I've ever had!!! Bought a bag full for the train ride home, their that good! Great service and amazing drive thru system.",1
459,"This review is a reflection of the service (or lack thereof) rather than the food. I've ordered food from this location 3 times this month (2 through Grubhub and once on their website) and they've messed something up each time. These issues ranged from incorrect items to missing items. I tried calling this latest time, only to be put on hold for 10 minutes and then be hung up on. Unless you have a major craving for this place or are a tourist, don't bother.",0
460,"Terrible experience with delivery and quality of food. I hate to say this, I loved this place until today. Delivery service they are using , DoorDash is beyond terrible. Delivery was late, food was cold ;once it finally made it to my office, I was starving!! Bag the food was delivered in looked all banged up. Boxed they put the sandwich in had a hole in it, trust me, I took a picture, for the record. Chicken sandwich tasted like crispy chicken sandwich from McDonald's :-(  .
I called the store and was placed on a hold for at least 20 minutes - twice. At the end, they said they will refund the money for a sandwich. Thx, but that is not enough. A sincere apology would go much further in my case.",0
461,Food is fine downtown. Service downtown pales in comparison to service elsewhere. Yes I know it's a busy place but the portiloes on dempster gets just as busy during the hospital lunch rush. Waiting for your food if you order there is awfully slow as well as ordering it online. Terrible processes and systems in place as well makes the waiting excruciating. Best bet to have a decent experience would be to actually pay a delivery person to sit through the poorly managed pickup counter for you. Just don't expect your food anytime soon.,0
462,"one of the chicago city food emblems. the hot dogs are top notch, all the condiments will put your toungue in party mood and the fries are a good complement to that. from time to time the place is very crowded but the experience is worthy and the staff keeps the place super clean at all cost.",1
463,Went here for the first time and got a double bacon burger and it did not disappoint! Good prices and fast service. Ingredients seemed of good quality.,1
464,"Love visiting Chicago!! Love the Portillo's off Ontario downtown!! Go through the drive through with an apron on.....yes I said an apron. Italian Beef, dipped with hot peppers!! You have neither visited Chicago, nor lived in Chicago if you have not done this. Don't take it home. Eat it immediately!!!! Yes.....eat it immediately. Trust me when I say nothing else needs to be said!! Well except a milkshake with a whole slice of cake blended inside of it!!! Yes..... I said a milkshake with a slice of cake inside!! What are you waiting for? Stop reading this and go to Portillo's. Yes I'm encouraging you to go to Portillo's right now. Nothing else needs to be said.",1
465,"just average, I guess. it was super busy when me and my family ate here for the first time and was not impressed. hotdogs are soggy and not great. the hot dogs at the cafeteria at shedd aquarium were 100 percent better. Italian beef sandwich was not impressive at all, I've had three different ones from other restaurants and this was by far my least favorite, not even a close second. fries and onion rings were lukewarm which was odd since they were so busy. they have about 50 cups of prefilled soda sitting on the counter. by the time you get your soda it's pretty watered down from the ice melting. I can say the pasta salad is pretty good. I was told I have to visit here since it is my first time to chicago so I did. it will be my first and last visit to portillo's. I can imagine that before it was such a big tourist attraction the food was top notch, they seem to have a pushem in getem out mentality now. I was speaking with a chicago native in the restaurant that was working there and they said they have never had a hotdog from here? that should've been a dead giveaway. anyways go there for the nostalgia, not for the best food chicago has to offer. side note, the employee that was in there cleaning the bathroom while me and my son were using it was dropping F bomb after F bomb talking about how he got 1300 dollars on this week's check and said he ain't in no rush, them tables will get cleaned when I get to them. I'm doing me, f them they can wait for they tables.",0
466,"They really need to figure out their online ordering process. They forget sauces everytime and it's pure chaos when trying to pick up an online order. I ordered at 1130am yesterday through their app, which said the pickup would be ready at 12:03pm, then waited until 12:45pm for my name to be called in the online order pickup area.",0
467,"Delicious hot dogs, ribs, italian beef, shakes, and the cheese fries are dope too!",1
468,"Again, this place has unbelievable chocolate cake. The Beef & cheddar croissant with sweet peppers is killer. I love their hot dogs. I used to work at one of these places in Bolingbrook in the eighties. I believe it's the same building that held Sona video when they built the police across the street. That was on Boughton Road. Then Portillo's purchased an entire shutdown tool strip mall and created the Portillo's Mall. I don't know what's in the original Portillo's building on the southwest corner of Boughton and 53, but I know it used to be a Sona video. When I worked at Boughton they have so many opportunities for the grimace to evade conversation with me. I was younger and less likely to approach others with questions. Especially the types of questions about life, love, loss, happiness, Etc that you would ask a deity such as grimace. He is constantly getting around having to speak with anyone. I am curious if anyone else sees what I see?",1
469,"First time eating here, 2nd time visiting Chicago. Many people recommended this place. It's ok. You can tell its a cornerstone in Chicago. Lots of cool things to look at on the inside, unique to the city. The hot dogs are small to average so if you are a grown man you'll want to get 2. They also serve beer which was a plus. The taste of the hot dogs wasn't as good as everyone was telling me, but not bad.",1
470,Ordered online to be ready for pickup asap. It still took forever and my order was incorrect. My chicken sandwich was missing toppings so I told the carry out counter and it took literally almost 20 minutes for them to remake it. I'm not sure if they have to remake it or if they could of just added the lettuce tomato and mayo but 20 minutes extra when my order was wrong was ridiculous. So by the time my sandwich was ready my boyfriend was done with his and my fries were sitting cold. Cheese sauce was super hot so at least that was still warm. Very disappointing,0
471,"A Chicago native recommended we try the Italian beef here.  Didn't know what to expect but it was great.  Had to come back a couple days later.  The inside is a real experience, kinda like a Chicago open-air market.",1
472,"I have had Portillos before and it was good. So naturally when my wife and one year old were in the city we decided to try it when we were in the loop. We arrived around 12 on a Friday anr ordered our food and then proceeded to wait for a hour to get our order. Our order was only two items, so not sure what happened there but it was very disappointing to wait that long for fast food. We tried to talk to management at the time and their response was just that everyone has to wait. Which is fine, but I don't think a hour is a normal wait time.

Anyways.. the food was good but the experience was pretty terrible for us.",0
473,This place was very good!!! So good that we forgot to take pics of our food! Would definitely visit again when I return to Chicago!,1
474,"Very solid, quick meal. It doesnt leave anything to be desired. If your liking for somewhere iconic and reliable this is the place for you. But, if you're hungry for something authentic and in the conversation about Chicago food, I would recommend putting in some more leg work and picking somewhere smaller.",1
475,Went there the other day with my tour. We needed an area to accommodate around 20 people. Everything went smoothly and we were especially attended by a wonderful staff member by the name of Maurice. Such a sweet guy. Thanks for the hospitality!,1
476,"Great for famous Chicago style italian beef sandwiches! Love that they give you different side options. If you don't like your sandwich dipped in gravy (au jus), you can ask for it on the side to prevent soggyness. Didn't care much for the italian sausage. Service is so-so. Double check your order-the cashier forgot to add my fries. Overall, a must visit for first time visitors.",1
477,Great atmosphere and food. Prices are very affordable for a family. Everyone was able to get what they wanted. Finished off with a cake-shake on the house - it was delicious. Staff (especially the lady at the pickup counter) was spot on.,1
478,"Horrible horrible horrible service and delivery today. Had a holiday team lunch, placed order on Monday for today's delivery at 11:30am, delivery was 35 minutes late. My bag was busted, one order was missed, had shakes with no straws, and they didn't send any napkins or utensils. Luckily I had this area covered. I called the manager to complain about delivery and service and all she could offer is an apology for the inconvenience...completely unacceptable. I will never order a group lunch from Portillo's again and I'm contacting the corporate office with my complaint",0
479,"Never had a ""Chicagoan"" hot dog and was recommended to try Portillos and they were spot on. The filling, the flavor, all amazing! The place was uber packed which to me is always a good sign (especially when Chicago has like a million food choice restaurant options!)",1
480,Beautiful! Must-go in chicago!,1
481,"I grew up going to Portillo's.  I've traveled the country and there's no place that has an Italian Beef like Portillo's. Every time I come back home to visit, I've gotta get one....w/ cheese fries n' a chocolate cake shake!",1
482,"The ambience here is awesome with all the decorations. It seems like all the tourists go to this Portillo's location, so you may need to wait a while after you order to get your food. FYI, their italian beef sandwich is not as good as Al's.",1
483,"Food: Supposed to be a place for local favorites like Italian beef sandwich and Chicago hot dog. Does not disappoint in that regard but honestly you probably won't be waking in the middle of the night dreaming of their food.

Atmosphere: Crazy, fun tourist haven.

Value: Not bad for a crazy tourist place but I feel like there could be better places somewhere the locals hide.",1
484,This saved my opinion on Italian beef sandwiches which I was told I had to try. I got extra gravy and hot peppers. I'll come back next time I'm in town,1
485,"Amazing. There are a bunch of things here that are Chicago specialties that I've never heard of and the decor of the place is like a TGI Friday's, but with actual Chi-town artifacts. If you're visiting the city this is a can't miss. Try the Italian beef, you won't be disappointed!",1
486,Does this look appetizing to you?,0
487,"Hardcore tourist trap. If you want to wait 20 min for a soggy hotdog and slow service, then this is the place.",0
488,"I was not aware of Portillo's until a friend sent me a message telling me that this was his fave joint in Chi-town. So off we went after our mini-pizza tour, and grabbed a beef-and-sausage combo dog to go. We had it on the plane, and even cold, it was AMAZING. Will be back next time, and skip the sausage and just get the beef sammy instead. Definitely recommend you come try this at least once.",1
489,"The whole place has a cheesy atmosphere but in a good way.
Ribs and Hot Dogs are amazing and it’s a slightly unreal setting you’d expect next to a highway instead of 5 blocks from the magnificent mile.",1
490,I mean... its Portillo's.  A Chicago institution.  How do you give a bad score to an iconic restaurant who consistently provides exceptional service and an extremely filling meal?  You don't.  I went with the dipped Big Beef added sweet & hot peppers.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Too bad the closest location is about 4000 miles away.  DAMMIT!,1
491,"You will have a hard time hearing a negative review on this amazing Chicago chain.  There is nothing bad you can get here!!

If you are looking for something other then a dog or beef try the chopped salad.  Make sure if you are only here once to get the chocolate cake shake -- if you haven't had it you are missing out.  It's heaven!",1
492,"Good food if you get it. The worst service ever. Attendant took our order standing in line and wrote it on a bag. Gave the bag to the cashier and she read it back to me correctly. As I waited in line for the food I looked at the receipt and realized the cashier didn’t put 2 sandwiches on it. Went back through the line and ordered 2 more sandwiches. Waited forever, finally got our food and no French fries,smoothie or ranch sauce which were all ordered. Back again and informed smoothies need to be picked up in a an area signed ribs and pasta. Gave up on trying to get fries and ranch.

Won’t bother going into detail on the rude and completely helpless woman calling out numbers.",0
493,"Try the Italian Beef.  Cheeseburger is pretty good as well.

Describing an Italian Beef doesn't really sound all that appetizing.  However, this is literally the best sandwich I've ever had.  You have to try it!  You can order with dry, regular, or extra wet.  It's basically a shaved beef sandwich on Italian bread with Au jus poured over it.  You can get hot pickled peppers or sweet peppers on it.  Just try it.  It's amazing!",1
494,"Perfect place for a quick meal, even late night! Atmosphere is awesome and they typically have alcoholic drink options. Be sure to try an Italian beef, dipped!",1
495,"Me and my friend's milkshakes took 40 minutes, and from what I overheard from the employees, I believe they forgot our order, and if not, I have no idea how a shake would even take that long. The food I got before this incident was quick and good, but if you go, don't get a shake.",1
496,"Always fast service (as fast as Portillos gets), great quality food (my favorite is the Italian beef, dipped, with sweet and hot peppers, and cheddar — and cheese fries), and a great Chicago feel on the inside. This location is prime.",1
497,"First off - shout out to Jose who kindly went out of his way to get our family more waters for our table. Regarding food, my biggest complaint is the skimpy amount of beef on the sandwiches. For the price of the sandwich, it should match the photos in your advertisements!!! Fries were hot and tasty. Tamale and chili good.",1
498,"A friend recommended I try this place.  It is known for their Italian Beef sandwiches and chicago style hotdogs.  I ordered both and was pleasantly surprised.  I managed to get both items and be under 10 dollars.  They were both delicious and although there was a bit of a wait to get food hearing the ""order 181, your food is done"" kept me amused while I waited for my number 185 to be called.

The Italian beef was juicy and delicious.  The hot dog had great flavour and all the toppings were good.  Definitely give these guys a try.",1
499,"Not only did we have to wait over 40 minutes for our food, we had to speak to a manager to get it. The 1st girl didn't even call the manager so we tracked her down ourselves. Our order was simple, yet the manager herself omitted items. She even stated she put extra in the bag for our trouble....nope. Missing food, barely warm food, messily packaged food, overly lengthy wait time, poor customer service....equals an epic fail in my book.
Is ZERO stats a rating????",0
500,"First and probably the last time in Portillos. Nothing against them. The food was decent, the wait was slightly longer. But jumbo hot dog was watery and disappointing.",0
501,Went on a food tour that included Portillo's. It was fabulous. I was worried about the crazy mix of toppings on the hot dog but it was delicious.,1
502,We are here on our first night in Chicago and it didn’t disappoint. My hot dog was great and my husband loved the Italian beef sandwich. I would love to eat here again on our next trip.,1
503,"Fun place to eat. Good Italian beefs, hot dogs, and pastas. Don't leave without getting the chocolate cake shake. It is worth every calorie and every penny. There is also a drive thru if that interests you (menu is a little more limited here).",1
504,This place was underwhelming. The wait was almost an hour to get the food and then they gave us the wrong food. The Italian beef was season-less and dry!,0
505,This is an awesome place right in the heart of Chicago. The best hotdog I've ever had. The steak and cheese croissant was amazing and the onion rings were bitchin. The drive thru is an experience all it's own.,1
506,"Ordering and waiting for your food seems like a cluster at this place, but the food is good. Pro tip: the cake shake is way better than the cake by itself, so if you're undecided definitely go with the cake shake.",1
507,"Great Hot dog, ribs, meatballs..",1
508,"This place isbombtastic! Ample dining room, fast service, delicious specially food, everything you'd want and expect.",1
509,"We were visiting Chicago from VA and went here to get a good old Chicago dog! We waited in a very long line, which was worth every minute. Portillo's definitely delivered! I could eat here daily. Too bad we live so far away. This should be on your trip itinerary if ever visiting Chicago.",1
510,"Good fast food, courteous service, good location",1
511,I personally don’t like hot dogs but when a friend tells you that you must go to Portillo’s Hot Dogs to try it out it's definitely worth it. I am not from this area so the way they have you order the food is fast but to pick up your food is a different story. You’re stuck with 15-25 other people crowded waiting for your food. Besides that the atmosphere is great.,1
512,"For such a busy place, this Portillo's had a very efficient service system and I got my food in 10-15 min after being in an extremely long drive thru. The options are good and taste good as well. They are understanding and even if mistakes are made they are quick to fix them.",1
513,"Visiting from out of state, I heard Porttillo's was  the  best place to get Chicago style hotdogs. Staff plays to much,  while trying to service a lot of patrons. Very sloppy distribution of food.",1
514,The hotdogs are not bad. The grilled onions and condiments make the flavor. 2 stars because the really long wait time (20 min) after putting in the order and messy atmosphere.,0
515,"We come to Chicago to eat, usually for a few days at a time. When we do, we always come to Portillo's for dipped Italian beefs, usually with mozz and hot peppers. Fries are good, but not what you come here for. Beer is good, served in a frosty goblet style pint glass. Malts are another staple. So, if you're looking to leave much happier than when you arrived, go for DIPPED Italian beef, a malt and a frosty brew. Nothing else matters. By the way, it's pretty much always busy, do try and go off hours.",1
516,"Great burgers, fries, Italian beefs, pastas, desserts, and beer chalices. You do pay for it though. If you're interested in saving money this is not the place for a quick burger. No table service so you don't have to tip. It's basically a more expensive and higher quality burger joint. Reminds me of pub and grill food you'd get in a small town.",1
517,"Italisn beef sandwich was great. Hot dog was ok and a bit small.
Chocolate cake was so so.",1
518,"This place is always busy, so it's not a place I would recommend if you need food super fast.

However, the food is great. Amazing shakes dogs and burgers and the salads are good too. It's pretty easy to make everyone happy here!",1
519,Don’t place an order online.  There is no organization inside right now.  It’s just a big table with Uber and Grubhub and online orders yelling over each other to see if there food is ready.  Order placed 8:47p on a Sunday. Supposed to be ready 9:11p.  9:31p lady handing out orders freaks out and yells at  everyone for phones in face.  9:52p still telling me my order isn’t ready.  9:58p told my order was already made. Someone must have taken it.  10:04 can’t get anyone to tell me if they will re make it or help put my order back through.,0
520,"The prices and atmosphere were good. However, the hot dog wasn't anything spectacular. It actually made me sick to my stomach. Maybe it hadn't been fully cooked. Unfortunately because of that, I would not go there again.",0
521,A Chicago must-see. Everything is delicious and reasonably priced. Head up to the second floor for a fabulous view of the Hancock.,1
522,Consistently the worst pickup experience of any restaurant around the neighborhood. Avoid this location or don’t order online.,0
523,amazing every time. very quick.,1
524,Must visit for Chicago. Good food and very inexpensive compared to most restaurants here. Reminds me of the Varsity in Atlanta but without the all the grease.,1
525,"It's like any other Portillo's with great Italian beef, chocolate cake, and yummy pasta.

Except it was stupid busy, and this time, the staff seemed to not be able to handle it well - took me about 15 minutes to get my food, and others almost 30 minutes.

What happened to this place? I've been here before and they got the food prepared well and in short time too. Yes, there were alot of people and virtually nobody at the drive thru, but orders were coming out very SLOWLY.

Also, there was a busboy who was loudly complaining that we were there, messing up his cleaned and put away tables. Well, it's us customers who are doing business with the place, providing income for him! That kind of guy should not be working in the food service industry and work at a factory - you think you have it bad? A little dirt, loud noises and a high temperature environment will burn some good work ethic in you, you little whiny kid. I have no sympathy for him especially us customers are there - it doesn't matter if the place closes in 45 minutes. Do your damn job and shut up, and stop being entitled because you're not.

Yep, I probably won't be back because of this one bad kid and the lousy turnaround. Then again, I guess it's only because of us customers, wanting to buy some good food. Meh.",0
526,"I was very disappointed with the hot dogs here. Maybe I just don't understand Chicago style dogs, but it was not a pleasant dining experience. Didn't enjoy the fries either. The service was also no good. I'm giving it two stars because it's gotta be popular for a reason, right?",0
527,slowest drive thru workers of all time,0
528,"I've always loved portillo's, unfortunately when we went, we passed through the drive-through. The service was slow as the workers were having loud and inappropriate conversations with themselves. Further, the people serving us had their mask down to their chin. The girl who took our order leaned into my car and was yelling at her coworker from inside my car. She was asking for water, and ignored us for a little while, and then proceeded to take our order. She made a mistake and dipped my Italian beef, and when we got home to eat, it was soggy and gross.",0
529,Ordered online. Order to be ready in 22 minutes.  20min after that I'm still waiting  on the ribs.  Why couldn't you have texted me that the order would not be ready instead of having me wait?,0
530,"Very busy, but worth the wait. A must stop on your first time to Chicago, but I'd go again if I ever came back.",1
531,Do not get the chicken sandwich from here. I got a breaded chicken sandwich along with many other items and it was not done! Still pink and rubbery on the inside. Then I spoke to the manager he just offered a refund for the sandwich nothing more. Terrible customer service. On top of the raw chicken sandwich I’m pregnant!,0
532,"Best Chicago Dogs ever, plus a huge menu. I went with 3 others and we were all happy with ourbdelicipus selections. The chocolate cake shake is a must-try!!",1
533,"Would have given it 5 stars but they are super unorganized when it comes to picking up your food. The intercom system should be heard throughout the restaurant but since the clarity of the voice is crap, you have to wait in a herd of people by the counter where they hand out orders. It's a madhouse!  With all that said, the food was still delicious so when  I'm mentally prepared to deal with that again, I'll go back.",1
534,"Ordered  2 chop salads with grilled chicken, 30 mins later I got two chop salads with nasty old cold fried chicken! Tried calling and getting a refund and no one picks up, finally got thru to someone and they said yes hold on let me get you to the manager and disconnected the call. Not sure what happened here over last couple years but Portillos make Popeyes
Look like a 5 star restaurant with their below average customer service!",0
535,Great beef sandwich..very tender,1
536,"Not a big fan on hotdogs but decided to try a chili dog. The order was wrong, the system they have when ordering through the drive thru is interesting but slows everything down.....just my opinion. After we got our food, we had to wait for the car infront of us to move in order for us to go.... You just have to be there to understand. 2 stars coz it was quite an experience for us.",0
537,"Used to be the best place to go in Chicagoland for everyday food. Grew up on Portillos but now, at least in the last 6mo to year, they’ve really changed. Their service is amazingly slower than ever, they seem to have cut staff where there used to be tons of employees making sure everything went smooth and quick there’s now 1/3 and things move way slow spent an hour in drive thru, they’ve changed their meats, their breads, all their food taste different and it’s not better. Just about everything outside of the hotdogs is noticeably different and lower quality. I’m assuming it’s from the new ownership trying to improve profits. It’s a shame that they’re slowly ruining a Chicagoland tradition but that’s the truth.",0
538,Great Italian beef sandwiches. I lathered mine in nacho cheese and it was so damn good. Their Chicago style dogs were nothing to scoff at too. Also lathered it in cheese. I wish this place existed on the east coast.,1
539,"If you come to Chicago and don't go to Portillo's, did you even visit Chi-town?!?! This place is great, prices are reasonable and anything you get is delicious!! Of course you should try the Chicago dog and the beef croissant, they are amazing!",1
540,"While I can understand some of the hype, I still don't think the food is that great.

I tried some of the standards that were suggested to me, and I was a bit let down.

The chicago dog was good, but not the best I had while visiting.
The italian beef polish combo was good, but once again not the best I had. The polish sausage had alot of fat bits in it, and not in the good way.

The chocolate cake shake was a huge let down. I'm not even sure if there was actually any cake in there? At least I didn't slurp up any bits. Might have been a mistake on the back side, but even if it was just a chocolate shake, it was not worth getting.

I will say the french fries and cheese dip were amazing though. I could eat a bucket of both.

Also I think Portillo's is at least worth a visit if not for the environment and staff alone. I did enjoy the set up and order calling system. It was a bit interesting to watch the food being made while waiting for my number.",1
541,Awesome! I've had both their famous Chicago style hot dog as well as their Italian beef sandwich. Both were delicious. The perfect spot for a quick cheap meal.  I highly recommend.,1
542,I would give them 5 stars if it wasn't for the terrible service and super long wait time.  The food is one of my favorite still though!,1
543,For some reason It took 45 minutes to get 2 hotdogs,0
544,"Portillos is a chicago style dive through your soul food while you're greeted by three restaurants at once and is located in Chicago, Illinois. They’re most commonly known for their Italian beef and their Chicago doggos. The atmosphere definitely reminds you of the city your in so if you wanted a break, tough luck. It's always busy but not always clean and the whole place smells of onions and peppers
The service is very subpar but what would you expect when you have more than 100 customers at a time. The speed was surprisingly done pretty quick, but not McDonalds fast. Their accuracy was pretty good but sometimes they would up on peppers or items on Chicago doggo which can be annoying but it's usually good.
The menu isn't that much of a variety because the people that go there usually go there for the Italian beef or Chicago doggo, people don't usually go there for their burgers  but you can get them there. The presentation is always subpar but its not meant to be, your there for the food. The food is always super fresh because they have so many people customers going in and out.
The value of Portillos is very high, you get the bang for your buck, together it costs like 7 dollars to get everything you want.
Portillos is the place you want to be if you want the food from Chicago and is a great welcome to the city. This 5 star restaurant is an opportunity you will not wanna miss",1
545,"Fun experience overall and pretty good Chicago hotdog! Some things I wasn't too happy with: my hotdog was surprisingly small and got lost in a bun full of tasty condiments - if you're hungry I'd recommend 2! Also the ordering system was pretty archaic - rather than have your order number appear on a screen, you are forced to guess whether or not your food is ready while listening to someone yelling into an unclear mic. Please fix this issue Portillo's!",1
546,"Not sure if they have the best Italian beef, but they are certainly close. It helps that there are so many locations so that you are never far from a great selection of beef, hot dogs, and pasta selections. This location on Taylor is nice and clean with fast and friendly service.",1
547,"Customer service sucked too many young kids finding more interest in talking and playing rather than doing their job. Also , my order was incorrect , i returned the food only to get it a second time still not how i ordered. I’ve called several times to speak with a manger and i was unsuccessful with getting a manager in the phone . I’m usually not the one to write a negative review , but i am very displeased with my services received last night .",0
548,"Great food. I love this place. I will always go when in Chicago. The food and drinks are good. The service is fast! A piece of advice, no matter what anyone tells you, DO NOT USE THE WALGREENS PARKING LOT. They will tow your car within seconds of parking. I was told by a security officer to park there and I learned the hard way.",1
549,Tasty sausage beef sandwich.. lots of variety available inside..,1
550,"One of my favorite food places in Chicago, great food and a great environment. It's a Chicago classic that I'd recommend to everyone from long time residents to tourists. Most famous for their chocolate cake shake",1
551,Great food. Cheap prices. Had to take 1 star for the staff all just being in an aggressive mood when I happened to go. Hopefully they are not normally like that.,1
552,Disappointed this was widely tipped on a food guide to Chicago and it disappointed from start to finish. I wouldn't recommend it there are far better placed to experience.,1
553,Must trys for first timers: The Chicago dog and the Italian beef. Top notch!,1
554,"Fast service. Good seating.
Chaotic ordering system. The sandwiches were boring and tasteless. Air conditioned to the point that penguins would need to wear sweaters inside.",0
555,"Great food, awesome atmosphere, cheap prices.  It was our 1st time there.  We have been to Chicago many time, but thought that it was simply a hotdog place. Boy o' boy, where we wrong.  Their pasta looked SOOOOO good, I want to try that next time.

Fantastic experience!!!",1
556,"Service was good. But taste of italian beef is a little saltier than I remember. It has been a long time since having an italian beef since on lockdown, possibly it always been a salty sandwich and just noticing it now.",1
557,"Fantastic! The line was suuuper long but don’t let that turn you away,  because they take orders and get people moving through the line VERY fast, and got our order out just as quickly.

Very delicious classic Chicago hot dogs, a Chicago MUST!",1
558,"From the reviews, I was expecting nothing short of greatness, definitely not what I got. The lines are extremely long and I had to go through them twice because my order was placed incorrectly. I ordered a chicken sandwich (which was nasty btw) and was given a soggy philly cheese steak. I also ordered their ""famous"" ribs which were also nasty. They know nothing about barbecuing. Most of the rib was fall off the bone, while some of it was dried out, but the flavor of the barbecue was not good at all. If ever in Chicago again, I would never go back to this place. The food is not worth the time you will spend waiting in line and then waiting for your food.",0
559,"The food was okay but the service made the experience unbearable. My wife and I ordered from a cashier that was to incompetent to understand the order with out repeating it 4 times and acting irritated the whole time. Then we were told we would pick up food at 2 different places. Mine was ready in about 15 minutes. The it was another 45 minutes to get my wife's. So mine was cold before we ever left. While waiting for my wife's order I decided to get a shake, I waited 10 minutes at their desert counter then I was very rudely told I had to go to the bar for that. I will not ever be back and with all the great other options in Chicago Id say find somewhere else",0
560,"Great food, Amazing Cake Shake",1
561,"A great place if you're in the mood for some American food but are undecided on what to eat. Portillos offers you choice: from Italian beef, to pizza to hot dogs, to chocolate cake.

I have tried the pizza, Italian beef and the chocolate cake. Everything was really tasty! It was slightly on the greasy side so it makes for a pretty unhealthy meal on the whole. The chocolate cake is a great way to end a meal there. The portions are huge, and the cake is both moist and sweet. A must try!

The service and decor are top notch. They have a really efficient serving line, while you may have to wait a little while for your food, you can be sure the kitchen staff are working full steam to getting them to you as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, I have not had the chance to try the hot dogs. I have heard so much about them and I will definitely make it a point to try them the next time I visit Portillos.",1
562,"Great food, cheap prices, awesome decor",1
563,Best dipped sandwich I’ve eaten. Surprised that it’s not too soggy.,1
564,Always phenomenal.... always. Great beef and dogs. Super impressive by an employee running around giving supplies to guests and resetting tables ... if I could have given it more than five stars I would have because of her.,1
565,"They have everything.  Had no idea what a variety of food would be available - dogs, of course, but also Italian beef, pasta, burgers and beer.  The Italian beef was good but the arrabiata was too hot (yes, I know it's supposed to be spicy).",1
566,Omg. Everything is just wow!,1
567,"Great taste, cake shake uhm yummy, same as the sandwich, hot dog was lil raw",1
568,"This is a fun place. Food is delicious and prices are reasonable. We didn't know this, but you have to pick the hotdogs up at a different pickup counter than the pasta, salads and soups. We went a fair few minutes before we figured that out. Staff are very friendly and helpful.",1
569,"The food was great. I ordered the Chicago style hot dog, Italian beef, and chocolate cake shake. I ate way to much. I preferred the hot dog over the Italian beef though.",1
570,"Very eclectic place to eat. Amazing hot dogs, Italian beef, chili dogs, and onion rings. While the chocolate cake was good, the eclair cake stole the show. Definitely a place to grab a bite while visiting Chicago.",1
571,Baked spaghetti is fantastic. Italian beef and hot dogs are amazing. A must if you're visiting from out of town. I'm from Chicago but I go to school out of state and I stop by everytime I come home from school!,1
572,I love Portillo's so much. They have such great prices compared to other restaurants and their food is delicious! I have recommended Portillo's to countless friends and family members and will continue to do so! Please give this place a try,1
573,"This our first time to this one in Chicago.  We had only been to the Mesa AZ prior to today.  Its a must stop for great food.  I  gave it 5 stars even though I  order got lost, the chocolate cake made up for the extra wait.",1
574,"The food was excellent but they were incredibly busy and it took a long time to get our food. Everybody was crowded together like they were in a moshpit near the pickup counter. That said, they did everything they could to make it run as smoothly as possible. Only issue I could blame management for was keeping a portion of the upstairs closed, which left almost empty tables for new customers to sit at.",1
575,"Amazing food, great atmosphere!!! Don't miss this place!!!",1
576,"1st time at this downtown location. I only gave it a 3 bc although the hot dog was as expected it was kind of ridiculous to wait 20+ minutes in the drive thru for a hot dog when there were only 4 cars ahead of me. The Schaumburg location handles 20-30 cars and the wait is 5 minutes or less.
The employees working outside at this location were friendly and helpful.",1
577,Legit spot for a great italian beef sandwich. You unwrap it and the yummy bread is already getting soaked through at the edges with delicious juice from the meat. The chocolate cake shake is one-of-a-kind amazing !,1
578,Interesting decor inside but the food was over rated. It had poor service flow and was pretty stingy with the condiments.,1
579,"The Portillos on Ontario is larger and more crowded than other locations.  The wait to order at lunchtime is usually at least a few minutes.  Did can take up to 10 minutes too be prepared.  The food is consistent but nothing fantastic for the price or restaurant format.  Definitely better than the national QSR chains, but you shouldn't expect the highest level of quality and taste that you might receive from some of the neighborhood jewels around town.  3.5 stars given the recent issues in the press",1
580,"Ugh Portillos is so, so good there is no comparison.",1
581,Not expensive at all! Amazing taste.,1
582,When I visited Chicago I tried this place as some friends recommended it. Seeing how busy it was during lunch rush I assume that it is a Chicago staple. The food was good and I wish I had ordered more. The only drawback is receiving your order as the waiting area is a little chaotic.,1
583,"Awesome Chicago staple that everyone should have. The Chicago dogs, chili cheese dogs, and crinkle fries were wonderful. Be patient with the order and fulfillment process as they have a high volume of customers, and please pay attention to numbers being called out!",1
584,"Hot dogs and chocolate cake are life here!!!!  Nothing fancy, just good food.",1
585,"A must visit for anyone visiting Chicago!  Authentic Chicago style dogs that are nutritious, filling and delicious! Even if you're not a fan of hotdogs this place deserves a chance. Also Italian meat is a must!",1
586,"The food is always good. And I recommend the burgers over the hotdogs! In my visits, I've noticed that the drive thru is way faster than dining inside. One recommendation I have for this location is to encourage their employees to be friendly and inviting.",1
587,"I love this place. Tasty and juicy Italian beef, and really good hot dog, in a very convenient location. BUT, I can't give it five stars because it is always so damn crowded and chaotic at the counter where you get your order. They're fast though.",1
588,"The atmosphere was really neat. It's set in the early 1930s. The food was really, very good. Having said that, the customer service was horrible. When going to order, the lines were all very confusing. I would recommend highering people that actually want to work there and making ordering easier.",1
589,Fun hot dog joint with Chicago flair. (All their food will require you to take an antacid later.) These people feed a massive number of people every day. Lines out the door but you still get your food pretty quick. Their assembly line operation is really fun to watch!,1
590,"The place opened up at 10:30 am, and was immediately swarmed by teamsters, cops and other blue-collar workers on break. This was - as I had hoped - a sign of a great meal to come! Best hot dogs and Italian beef around, for little coin.",1
591,"One of the best fast food restaurants I have ever been to. I only had a couple different items, which were amazing, but just seeing the other food I could tell everything was quality eats. If I ever go back to Chicago, I will definitely be heading back!",1
592,"Visited Chicago from California and tried this hotdog place. We did a survey and got free fries which were good. We ordered their house hotdog and it was good. This place had anther food vendor in the same building and they had chairs set up like a food court, which was nice.",1
593,Literally the workers in the drive through are extremely ghetto and unprofessional. They’re tryna be cute and giving wrong orders. Funny part is they think it’s cute. They don’t do there job correctly at all. They literally gave me and my parents 2 wrong orders before we got our actual one. They dance and prance around while talking about they’re personal lives out loud. It’s not a good look what so ever.,0
594,Great food and beer. This is your chance to try the Chicago Hot Dog,1
595,"I've come here many times since childhood and the food is always awesome! I love this location specifically because of the interior. Great prices, good service and of course, amazing Italian beef, shakes and desserts.",1
596,"It was good, but overhyped. Tried it due to the hype and people talking about the place and the dogs, but we had better during our visit to Chicago. My advice is to stick with the little guys for a truly authentic Chicago dog.",1
597,Got the classic hotdog and chocolate cake shake and thought both were hella overrated. Def want to give this another shot given how popular it is but we’re definitely not impressed by the first go around. At least the line goes quick 🤷🏽‍♂️,1
598,This is the place to taste the Chicago's famous Hot dogs!,1
599,"Love the food. Lines were extra long,  but they moved efficiently. Price is affordable.  They have started an online ordering system, but we didn't know ahead of time so I don't know how efficient that is. Food was hot and delicious. Tables were clean.",1
600,"Portillo's is such a cool place to visit. It has everything inside this quasi-food court space. They have pasta, sandwiches, hot dogs, soft serve and more. We just got their hot dog and chocolate cake shake since we just had deep dish for dinner. We can only eat so much in one night ;)

The Portillo Dog we got has some pickles, hot peppers and really nice Vienna dog on it. It is quite refreshing and delicious even without all the ketchup and mustard to dress it up. I was very impressed. Obviously, this is no gourmet hot dog but I like the dog nonetheless.

The chocolate cake shake is absolutely a winner. You can taste bits of chocolate cake inside! I don't think it is a good shake in terms of nutrition but if you love sweets, you cannot miss it!",1
601,"My husband and I had a terrible experience. We went through the drive-thru and we were one of the first two front cars. The runner outside was delivering orders to multiple cars behind who placed orders after us while we just sat and waited blocking in all the cars that had their orders. When we finally received our order, items were missing (no peppers at all on the beef sandwich and the gravy on the side we ordered
). There was no way we would even tell them and cause all the cars behind us, who had their food delivered, wait any longer so my husband just ate a Very dry beef sandwich!!",0
602,"I HATE hotdogs, but this place..... This place makes me rethink my entire life. This is the MOST DELICIOUS meal I've ever had. Hands down. 💯💯💯 Sooooo good!!",1
603,"Their chicken strips were very good and even better with barbecue dipping sauce. The restaurant was nice and clean, the wait time was short. Staff could have been a bit more friendly.",1
604,"Great place. Great food. Its hot dogs mostly,  hard to mess that up.  Its five stars except for the fact that this food is intended to be slid to you out a window and devoured while standing on a Chicago street corner. Now that's ambiance.",1
605,"Great hot dogs. Got the jumbo dog with everything and some onion rings. Really delicious and it was the best breakfast I've had in Chicago. Seriously, wish we'd eaten this for breakfast all week that we've been here lol",1
606,"It's like most commercially popular tourist trap restaurants that is more hype than anything else. It wasn't bad or anything, but just ok. It's something to check out your Chicago bucket list  to do, but necessarily have to go back",1
607,"Ordered catering weeks in advance for a late night drop for our wedding from this location. No call, no show. Their excuse? The driver decided to cancel the delivery of his own accord. Their solution? Do nothing. The manager had no empathy and offered no solution/resolution for the bridal party, not even an apology. Multiple calls back and no one answers. Great job guys, tip of the hat to you.",0
608,"Really good Italian beef, done Chicago style.  Have had it in a long time, since I'm down in Norfolk VA. now.  Great food a pretty fast service considering the dinner rush.",1
609,Portillos is definetly a place to go for the Italian beef sandwich and of course the famous Chicago dogs. This place even sells beer to wash down their delicious food. You gotta try their chocolate cake shake and/or just their chocolate cake. I would recommend this place to anyone who's in Chicago before they leave.,1
610,"Good food for a good price, and stays open until later in the evening when compared to most nearby places that are similarly priced. I took one star off because they have two different places to pick up the food (after you ordered and paid at the cashier) and it's not clear where you should go wait for your order. So this can be confusing, especially to first time customers.",1
611,"OMG!!! So good! Had the beef and cheese croissant and the ribs!!! So good I ate all before taking yummy pics, embrace the energetic ordering process, you will be glad you did, They have fresh lemon cake now!! Get that too.",1
612,Cool atmosphere. Good prices but I wasnt blown away on the chicago beefs. So much hype around it that I thought it would be better. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.,1
613,"This place is what I was looking for when I wanted some Chicago style  junk food. Over the top decor (they've got a Tommy gun in case) and food that matches. Dogs here are great, Chicago style with mustard, tomatoes pickles, onions, poppy seed bun, etc.   The place gets busy, and you order and have to wait for your ticket but there's plenty of seating. Prices are super reasonable and portions are good, not huge, but you wont leave here hungry. The dip sandwiches are overlooked but good as are the fries.  The cake shake will put you in a sugar coma but if you like sweets is worth it, definently not for everyone though, and not quite what I expected. I imagined there would be chunks of cake, frosting and all in a shake, instead you have cake blended into a shake. The difference?  Cakes blended in lose that cakiness and it only gets nice and cakey with the last sips.....jesus, am I really writing about a shakes ""cakiness"" guess thats where my life is now. Still if it means I get to eat at places like Portillos than let the inevitable decline of my life continue. Five stars!",1
614,Great food that lives up to the hype however the place is a zoo and they don’t have a very efficient order and waiting system. Lots of waiting around for your name to be called. I had to double check that everything was in my order because they missed a dessert and a shake. Would still go back for the food though.,1
615,"Great beefs, amazing burgers, cold beers, and fantastic chocolate cake. The line can be a bit long at times, but it moves quickly.  Only reason for the deduction of one star is the annoying tourists.  Constant at this spot, and that gets old.",1
616,"Wonderful and delicious variety of hometown favorites food, welcoming atmosphere. Easy to find from the 65 bus stop, not far from Navy Pier via bus. Glad we are getting these in our hometown. They're GREAT.",1
617,The place was very busy on a Sunday afternoon at 2pm. The Drive Through had people backed up down the street. It was a little hard to figure out the system. You wait in one of several long lines to place your order and then wait for them to call your number on your receipt. The sevice was friendly. I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and the Onion Rings. Both were good.,1
618,"They serve the best hot dog in the world. Highly recommended. Delicious people delicious food. Also, their burger is tasty and their Italian beef sandwich is one of a kind!",1
619,"Food was really good, but extremely confusing for a first timer.  Need someone at the door explaining for first time customers.  After all this is a tourist destination.  Second the staff taking orders was extremely rude and not helpful at all!

Update:. Michael stopped us on the way out to top off our drinks, which helped increase the customer service points.",1
620,"Go early to avoid the lines. It's good beef hot dogs and italian beef sandwiches. Orders take a long time and our order got lost in the lunchtime crowd. Was tasty though, so visited this place twice in a week.",1
621,"EDIT:The drive-thru experience has gotten better.

Absolutely horrid drive-thru. More than half-a-dozen times I've had to drive off due to the car line spilling into the street and other cars cutting into line and the employees out there who see it just accept it. So annoying.",1
622,"Food was good. But it takes a long time to get your food. So not best for a quick bite or even moderate speed. And some of the workers were not very friendly and were rude. Plus they didn't place our order correctly so we didnt all get exactly what we asked for, even after repeating it SEVERAL times to the young lady. But we didn't even bother to have them correct our order because we didn't want to have another super long wait.",1
623,Best hotdog and italian beef sandwich i had in my whole life!,1
624,"This place always serves good fast food, always a good vibe despite being a conveyor belt with customers, good memorabilia! A good ol' place to bring visitors as well! Will keep coming back",1
625,I was afraid to try a Chicago Dog but it was spectacular. Now I'm back home craving them with no Portillo's for 100 miles! Must Try: the chocolate cake shake. They make a shake out of an actual peice of chocolate cake. It. Is. Divine.,1
626,"The hotdogs weren't my favorite, but the Italian beef was pretty good.  Glad I tried it once to say I did. Chicago staple...ya gotta just go!",1
627,Delicious! Must try the Chicago Style Hotdog and the Breaded Chicken Sandwich.,1
628,"Theme is to be rushed, stressed and crammed in. They leave huge sections of restaurant closed while you have to stand around watching your food get cold just to keep up the appearance of bring crowded. This place is twice the price without being of better quality of the many good hotdog stands in Chicago.  Strictly for tourists, and suburbanites wishing for some of city nostalgia.",0
629,We love the food! It was very hot standing around the pick up area. It took 20 minutes for our food. Our table needed cleaning and the station upstairs did not have napkins for me to wipe it.,1
630,My wife and I decided to try the famous portillos. And it tasty. I went for the Chicago Dog and despite the toppings the sausage was awesome. My wife's chili dog was equally delightful. I understand why this is a local favorite.,1
631,Who doesn't love portillos? The Polish dog Chicago style is a must. Cheese fries are dreamy. The chocolate cake shake is like no other you've ever tried.,1
632,"DO NOT GET A HOT DOG. Even if you want to try a ""chicago style"" dog and you are out of town, it is literally the same thing you can get at a grocery store. The other food on the menu is fantastic. I loved the Big Beef with peppers/cheese.",1
633,Stood in line for half an hour after ordering my food. The Chicago style beef hot dog and beef roast sandwich was definitely worth the hype. Will definitely order it again.,1
634,"When visiting Chicago, this spot was recommended by a fellow co-worker who is from the city. Excellent Italian beef sandwiches, and beer. I have been here twice, both times when visiting Chicago. I tell anyone going to visit the city to stop off at this place. Delicious!",1
635,"I'll tell you what, that beef and cheddar croissant was on point! I could have eaten another 4 of those puppies. I guess I was supposed to get a Chicago Dog at Portillo's but went with the beef in stead and I am glad I did. My dad got the hamburger and it was rather lack luster, just an FYI.",1
636,Great Chicago.style food and atmosphere in the heart of downtown in the Windy City!,1
637,"I'm not a hot dog fan, but this is the one to try in Chicago. Other food options also available. Great atmosphere and high quality food. Definitely returning next time I'm in town!",1
638,"Love Portillo's! The hot dogs are awesome, but the beef and sausage combo is amazing.
Also, if you enjoy chocolate, the cake is well worth the trip.",1
639,"Very cool atmosphere and wide assortment of not just hot dogs, but burgers, pasta, cake, and more. May be a tourist trap, but it's a convenient location and has plenty of space for you to enjoy a little taste of Chicago cuisine",1
640,The hotdogs are just okay. Nothing special. The whole place is really nice. Very american.,1
641,"Came during a slow time. Made a rookie mistake and got the Bacon Cheeseburger but still a solid bite for the price. The atmosphere is cool. I know nothing about the place, but it’s clear to see it has history. Glad I came here.",1
642,"Great food, great atmosphere, and above all, friendly and helpful staff.  Burger and beef ordering and pickup lines were at least a 20 min wait, so I decided to get a salad and sandwich, and I had my food in 3 minutes.  I guess that's expected for afternoons in Chicago!",1
643,"We visited Portillo's to grab a quick lunch. We figured it must be great due to the number of reviews and it's 4.5 star rating. We walked in and found the place packed! We waited patiently in one of the 2, wait 3, no wait 4 lines for placing orders. We must have gotten into the slow lane but upon reaching the order taker (Zion) we realized what was up. She was painfully slow and didn’t seem very interested in working today.
Anywho we placed our order and then went on the hunt for an open table, here is a tip there seems to be more seating upstairs than downstairs. We waited patiently for our number to be called and was excited that it only took about 15 mins for our dogs and onion rings to be ready.
Sadly none of the rigmarole was worth it for me; The chili cheese dog I had to endure was bland and the hotdog a bit chewy. My hubby loved his regular hotdog which I admit looked much more appetizing than my chili cheese dog.
All in all I would probably go back for another visit but definitely NOT order the chili cheese dog.",0
644,Chicago dog was like $3.00.  Inexpensive classic Chicago food.,1
645,"Portillo's is delicious, no doubt. But this location (with out fail) will mess up your order.

Of the 5-10 times they've only got it right (the first time) once.

So check your bag, CLOSELY.",1
646,"Great place for a quick bite to eat in downtown Chicago. They have a drive thru and they move you through it fast, which is great when you are not on foot. Shakes are thick and great tasting to cool you off during the summer!",1
647,Went to Portillos for a one stop Chicago experience. The hotdog was tasty as was the Italian beef but presentation was lacking the dog was sloppily put together and they forgot my drink when they called my order. Maybe we went at a bad time? I'd try it again.,1
648,"The people, the food and the atmosphere were all so amazing. The vibes you get from the place was perfect. The workers were friendly food came in a timely manner given the amount of customers. Out of towners like me are sure to call me back!",1
649,"Someone suggested this place to me and my friends. We ordered quite a bit of food, but it was ready immediately and we thoroughly enjoyed it! I would go here again.",1
650,"Zero stars.
Menu said hamburger not cheeseburger and said that it came with lettuce tomato and mayonnaise no mention of cheese also no one asked me if I wanted cheese when I ordered so I did not expect my burger to come with cheese but they covered it with American which is disgusting to me and I will not eat it.
Also, I asked for my bacon Crispy Crunchy and well done and yet they put raw soggy chewy bacon on the burger. I would not eat raw bacon or American cheese no matter what. I threw it straight in the trash.
I would never go back to this place.",0
651,"Portillos is a Chicago classic, but it's probably not the first choice for true inner-city folk. There are plenty stands in the city that are either better with dogs or better with beefs. The restaurant itself is nice and feels clean, but again as a native to the city I usually would pick other places first.",1
652,I am giving only 1 star due to the service I received yesterday. I used the drive thru yesterday and there was a line of cars I couldn't figure out what the hold up was but as I found out there was no one even out there taking orders finally after several minutes went by someone finally came out. I ordered a cheeseburger and two orders of cheese fries. Remind you I already waited in a long line to order and others that were behind me with LARGE orders received their food before me. I waited 10 mins before getting my food. As I get home I come to find out after a few bites I had no burger just bread and the condiments. I will be stopping by today. Also I forgot to mention as I was waiting for my food an employee joking about another customer having problems about their food. Not professional at all if I must say seeing that I work in the food industry. I been to this location plenty of times but seems that every time I come back the service is not what it use to be.,0
653,Good dogs. Just a confusing lay out. Staff were not helpful.,1
654,"This is  not my favorite place for Chicago style food but it is an affordable place to have a dog or sausage in the downtown area.  I have taken several of my children there while we were on vacation.  Although the lines are long I always seemed to get through them quickly.  They usually have an employee working the line, writing your orders on a bag that you can hand to the cashier in order to speed things up.

Portillo's is very popular, not just with tourists but also with native Chicagoans.  I've seen locations in the suburbs that had to have a police officer to direct traffic during the lunch rush.  As far as an Italian beef sandwich is concerned, I would rather go to Mr. Beef's.",1
655,"There are three things I love here: the char-style hot dog, the double cheese burger and the cheddar cheese croissant sandwich. I am not a fan of the crinkle style fries because it reminds me of Cheap store bought oven baked French fries. The char-style dog rocks. You must ask to have it charred. This is the way to go. It is so good. Just a warning they will not char it for you if you order from the drive thru. The double cheese burger is so delicious. It's not fancy but it just hits the spot. Don't get a single cheese burger. My wife tried to get me to go healthy once and I told her never again. It's double or nothing for me. Finally, I know it sounds crazy but a butter croissant goes good with the Italian beef. But I will deny ever saying that because I don't want my Chicago card taken away. Oh yeah if you do eat here, then get the giant Schooner of Beer. You have to order it from the bar but it is the best deal for a beer in the area.",1
656,"I mean I know this place is legendary to Chicagoans but I was less than impressed.
I wanted so bad to be onboard with the whole Portillos Italian Beef thing..
I just couldn't find the magic in a salty wet roast beef sandwich with awkwardly placed peppers that fall off everytime you pick the sandwich up.
Sorry Chicago 😭
I love Chicago!",1
657,"Our order was missing various items, that we paid for which caused us to have to go back.  The bag was stapled together tightly so we didn't check before we left.  The cheeseburger we ordered was overcooked and no napkins whatsoever were in our bag.  Not sure if we will come back to the location on Ontario St.",0
658,Great food. Excellent and friendly service.  Clean as a whistle. Excellent as always,1
659,I love portillos...but the last several experiences have been a communication nightmare...i always order a combo with grilled onion soaked but each time the sandwich comes back just some what dry...the problem the bread is so doughy that it takes away from the overall taste. I expect to taste au jus grill onions sausage and beef. Not nawing and snagging at the bread to get to the sandwich because of it being half dry ...better understanding is needed at point of order perhaps a repeat of order if ordertaker is confused. Allow customer to emphasize before sending in order.. whats a few more seconds to get it right? Please take this into consideration..i will be back!,0
660,"The food was good and the atmosphere fun and interesting, but the ordering system is not as efficient as advertised.  I stopped by with the family so we had a mix of orders.  Even though you can order from one line the food (hamburgers, sausages, hotdogs, shakes) are picked to the left and the other items (salads, ribs, etc.) are to the right.  That meant we had to split up th get our orders.  I went to the hotdog side which was a chaotic mass of people, but relatively quick.  Check your order when you grab it because there were several mistakes.  The other line with the salads and entrees was shorter, but took twice as long.  My food was cold by the time their orders were done.

I'm glad we stopped and sampled a Chicago tradition, but it wasn't my favorite place.",1
661,"Portillo's was exactly the kind of eating experience I wanted to have in Chicago - it's not amazing food by any means, but I love a good chili dog, and this place does it very well.  The chili was almost as good as the chili I'm used to having in Texas, which is saying something.

Overall, I think this is a great place to try a Chicago style dog (or another way, if you prefer, as I did), and to soak slin some of the distinctly Chicago ambience of Portillo's.",1
662,"Don't be fooled because of the hot dogs in the title.  There is SO MUCH MORE at Portillo's.  Ribs, sausages, salads, burgers,  all of the American staples, and the Service is Great too. Ignore the long lines, they move quickly. Enjoy!",1
663,This place... 👅 OMG!! It was right down the street from my hotel and it was amazing! Thier Chicago dog was on point and if I lived there I would definitely be going there everyday. Besides the dogs they have amazing pasta bowls. I'd also like to live off of their chocolate milkshakes for the rest of my life.,1
664,"Always on my list of places to take out-of-towners. You can't go wrong with their menu. The Italian Beef w/cheddar on a croissant is a do-not-miss. Best fries in town, but they have a secret, they are cooked in animal fat. Make sure your vegetarian friends know that. Their catering is fantastic if you ever need to feed a crowd. SO many Chicagoland locations and for good reason!",1
665,Food is great. Staff not very friendly and it can take quite a while to get your ffood,1
666,"If you come here, be prepared to wait.  This place is always busy and rightfully so, it's a massively sized portillos and it's in the loop.  They serve beer, which is cool.

BE warned! If you order cheese fries to go, check the cheese.  Thankfully I checked mine and didn't walk away with a spilled cheese cup.",1
667,"Nice place, good food, but super busy and hard to get through the drive through.  Typically clean and nice staff. Has it's moments, but the hot dogs are good!",1
668,"Great, speedy service in the drive thru. They have it down to a science. The french fries are among the best anywhere - and the bacon cheeseburger is delicious and juicy. The food doesn't travel well, so either eat in or pull over to the side of the road and enjoy while it's hot.",1
669,"4 star food, 3 star name, 2 star management system. A very long wait is mandatory prior to obtaining a customer’s food. This facility utilizes a system very similar to that of the McDonalds, albeit working with a great number of people. After a customer has ordered their food, they must cluster in an area in order to acquire their food. This system is highly ineffective and often leads to long wait times. After a customer has obtained their food, the process of finding a seat and a table is rather easy. This is caused by many other customers leaving the facility prior to obtaining their food, after frustrated by the long waiting times. After a customer has sat down, or in some rare cases, take out their food, they may finally consume them. If a customer consumes items such as hotdogs or sandwiches offered in this facility, it is possible for them to finished the process of consuming rather quickly. This can be caused by the food tasting in such a manner that it pleases the customer during consumption. Some customers may avoid ordering such specialties offered in this facility. Other offers in the facility includes pasta, ribs and so on. The food may or may not please the customer as it depend on their preferences. This can make the consumption of such food rather slow and painful. The environment surrounding the area of food consumption can be described as boisterous.",1
670,Love this location. The staff is friendly. It’s clean. I recommend ordering online to skip the line!,1
671,"Whether you are here for Portillos or Barnellis your food will be satisfying. Customer service is good from management if an order gets messed up, but the regular service from the cashiers can be hit or miss. Your food comes fast, I recommend going in off-peak times for the optimal experience as lines here can get very long.

Suprisingly vegan friendly- you can order a pasta and marinara from Barnellis, or the ""Nudie"" (a Chicago dog bun with no dog!) from Portillos.

Non-vegan food- They have killer onion rings, Italian Beefs, and Chicago dogs. Difficult to go wrong with any ""classic"" Chicago food. I do not recommend the burgers, there are plenty of better places in the area for a good burger.",1
672,Great Italian Beef with hot giardinare,1
673,"2 chili dogs & cheese fries were good. Ordered 2 shakes to go for which we waited nearly 30 minutes. Attempted to ask someone at pickup section to assist but nobody even looked at me. Finally went to the cashier for assistance who told a girl about the order being 25min old. After complaining about the machines down for cleaning, one girl started making the shakes. When finished, she aggressively placed the shakes down for pickup not saying a word. No ""sorry for the wait"" or ""here you go"". As we grab them, my girlfriend sarcastically says, ""appreciate it"" and walks away. The girl then yells in our direction ""I know that girl's not getting smart with me...Come back here. I dare you."" To top it off, the shakes were horrible. The chocolate malt was gritty with powder and the strawberry shake was vanilla with the occasional strawberry clogging the straw. Should've went to the McDonald's across the street. Visiting from Charleston this was my first Portillo's visit and my did it leave an impression.",0
674,"You will get great food here no matter what.  If you are looking for a great example of a Chicago hot dog, then this is the place to go.  A Chicago dog has onions, relish, mustard, a pickle wedge, a couple tomato wedges (yes I'm serious), and a couple hot peppers (yeah...it's a lot).

Honestly, I'm not into the Chicago style hot dog, but it is good to try at least once! You can always pick off the big stuff later.  Just no ketchup. Never. Ketchup.",1
675,"First time visiting this market style restaurant. It's a fun atmosphere, but you have to wait in multiple lines to get different things.

Second visit, screwed up my entire delivery order, order took nearly two hours and I was only 0.6 miles away, left out items I paid for, food was all cold, bad experience all around. They also hung up on me 6 times while I was just trying to call and get some help.",0
676,"Yes.. Great as usual!! Actually,they got everything about my order wrong!. Then i called to let them know,and they put me on hold saying theywere getting a manager and waited for over 20 minutes.. I hung up and called back and finally talked to the both. Long story short, they made everything right the next day and it was great! And frankly even the messed up order was good, just not what i wanted. Overall, you're going to wait, n you're going to pay but Portillos is always worth it!.",1
677,"Not fast, fast food. Waited 30 minutes in a line where there are 3 lines... finally get to the front of our line and our register person warns, “ I will be zigzagging between your 2 lines”  The other 2 lines were not zigzagging, so of course I said something. The kind couple in the line next to us said go ahead. Finally the order, then there was further chaos trying to pick up the food. The couple with us got their order 20 minutes prior to us. It took 90 minutes in this place. Oh, they only ordered one of the 2 orders of fries, so still hungry.",0
678,"I've never had anyone serve an ""Italian Beef"" sandwich without giardiniera! I was really excited to take my wife out for an Italian beef sandwich on her first weekend in Chicago. What she got was a flavorless, soggy roast beef sandwich. The chili dog was underwhelming also. I feel embarrassed for talking up the food in Chicago. Next time I'll take her to Al's.",0
679,"Worst experience... it was highly recommended by a friend, but initial reaction seeing fries being stuffed in drawers with wrappers like if it was a garbage can... very poor customer service. the food was cold water dripping from the bag they ran out of everything... the only thing good their was the Sprite drink. Disappointed I see all good reviews yet we got a very bad experience. Dont eat here.",0
680,The Italian beef was delicious! The staff was helpful and cheery. Only gripe would be I really don't like soggy bread and asked for mine with gravy on the side and it was still soggy.,1
681,"I love all the food here, is great!!",1
682,"Chicago dog is ok but not as tasty as expected. Mexicali hot dogs are much better. Italian beef was good. Not great as I was told and had anticipated. All in all, I probably would not go out of my way again.",1
683,"One word: yum. We have tried everything off their menu and it’s all good, but you can’t beat the hot dogs or grilled yellow fin tuna in my opinion. Or the fries. Or the ribs. Or the beef. ITS ALL GOOD!",1
684,"Great Italian dishes and sandwiches. Simple but yet delicious. The prices are also reasonable. Stick with what they are famous for. My friend persuaded me to try their Italian tamales and they are awful. I think they use polenta, instead of masa, to make them. I don't know what they use for the filling but it's mushy. They taste like the tamales in the frozen Swanson TV dinners. I am used to eating the Mexican ones.
The ordering system is confusing and chaotic. There are two sides to order and two sides to pick up. My order was called on both sides.
Everything here is self serve.
The restaurant is busy at all hours particularly during meal times. Seating is difficult to find when busy. This place is extremely noisy.
The decor is quite cute.",1
685,I had a double burger with cheese combo-it was good-nothing spectacular! Ohhhhh but the beef dogs with the pickle was AMAZING (according to my husband) we were visiting from #ALABAMA😉,1
686,What can I say everybody has to try Portillo's in Chicago. home of the Chicago dog the Polish dog and the Italian beef sandwich. It is a hot dog shoppe. It is a fast food place! what makes portillo's popular is there topings.  Once you've tried it you've tried it move on. The atmosphere was busy it is a tourist spot really there's nothing to write home about on this place in my opinion.,1
687,"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY OR PICK UP - We ordered $232 worth of food for a get together it was a disaster! The orders came unlabeled and multiple individuals got food mixed up. We ordered Cheese Fries and it came with no cheese just the fries, they should aluminum foil wrapping for the beef burgers versus paper since they soak in the bread and when the order came the paper was dissolved and sticking to the bread.",0
688,"This place is what it is. It's where drunk adults go in the wee hours on their way home. I went after midnight and was a little toasted, and, although I was impressed with food based on its quality. It was still high-quality fast food. Would I come here sober? Probably not. Did I enjoy it? You betcha. Solid three stars.",1
689,"This ""restaurant"" is an absolute cluster. Whatever you do, don't order ahead, you will end up waiting longer than if you just walked in and waited at the counter. The employees are aloof and completely uninterested with helping with the exception of a new girl working the phones at the bar who was the only one who actually apologized and offered help. The place is a novelty and there are far better options for the same menu within minutes of this location. Or perhaps try the suburbs where the restaurant isn't filled with teens hanging out successfully ordering beer from the incompetent ""bartender.""",0
690,Uh!mazing taste!! It can get a little busy but totally worth it,1
691,"The best hot dogs in Chicago! Why we don't do hot dogs like this in the UK, I'll never know! Great atmosphere and such an interesting place to eat with lots of history and memorabilia.",1
692,"Great atmosphere! Lots of interesting sculptures, b scenes, and artwork to look at.  The Chicago dogs were great, but the Polish dog was burnt. The way you ordered and received food was a bit chaotic.",1
693,"Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the food was good. The staff is rude (think of someone going to the heart of south side and yelling ""who wants a job?""). Personnel here definitely need training and they should be reminded that they are lucky to even have a job.

I'm a visitor in Chicago. Will not be eating here again. Go somewhere else.",0
694,"Good restaurant
The hamburger was amazing",1
695,"Great Chicago style resteruant! they have a large menu that can please anybody, the service is fast! the milkshakes are amazing! they have a large dining area so you can always find somewhere to sit! i would definetly visit this place again!",1
696,"Yellow mustard, neon green pickle relish, onion, tomato, pickled giardiniera peppers, a dill pickle spear, and a dash of celery salt make a hot dog come from Chicago. NO KETCHUP! The most important ingredient, however, is the Vienna Beef hot dog, because it is all about the snap of the dog. At Portillo's you get authentic, delicious hot dogs. Wash it down with a beer, and you have a meal.",1
697,The best beef sandwich and Hot Dog in Chicago.  We were served quickly and the place was packed.  All of the Portillo’s have a unique display of items hanging from the walls and ceiling.,1
698,"Best Chicago dog around. And the place has a fun vibrant vibe. It's busy all the time but the lines move pretty smoothly, plus you can order ahead if you know what you want.",1
699,"I place an order at 1120pm with an estimated arrival  of 1154pm and gladly accept the terms and await delivery.  I wait until 1230am and my food still hasn't arrived. I call the ""dasher"" listed on your app and am told that they never received my food. I'm at a complete lost here. You charged my card over $20 and failed to deliver the goods. Completely  unacceptable! I expect a full refund and best believe  I'll be down to your location in person to dispute this matter.",0
700,"Absolutely the worst delivery I've ever experienced.  I've tried now multiple times, and each time they forget components of the meal.  When you try to call, you cannot actually get the location, but you get a general line.  I've had the phone ringing now for 30+ minutes.  I do not want my other components now, as the rest of my meal is cold.  I want a refund and I will never order again from portillo's.  My advice is you shouldn't either.",0
701,I like the plant based hotdog!,1
702,Great chicago staple. The beef and cheddar croissant is sooooo good and so is the cake shake. A place everyone should try atleast once.,1
703,"Employees rushed us to order our food kept yelling at us for the next person in line.

Asked what all came on one of the wraps. The employee didn’t know, so she looked at their menu which I didn’t know they had. She said if I would like to customize it I could. So that’s what I did, except it came out completely as what was on the menu. The lady that gave us our food was rude and had an additide so I hated to bother correcting them. It was seriously the most disappointing thing I’ve ever ordered from a sit down restaurant, I couldn’t even eat it it was so bad the chicken on my wrap was cold.

What a waste of money, on the food, time, and $15 for my Uber ride over. I would highly suggest looking at the menu before you go and don’t order the buffalo chicken wrap unless you want to set yourself up for disappointment as dramatic as that sounds it’s true.",0
704,"LITERALLY one of the most important restaurants in Chicago!

If you're thinking to yourself, ""nah man, Chicago style pizza places are"", go to the doctor as soon as possible, because something must be wrong.

Writing a review for Portillo's & Barnelli's is like walking into the perfect buffet and trying to decide where to start. Everything is delicious here. I know I sound like a fan boy, but I used to live a block away and I've tried it all. Surprisingly, I'm not a million pounds *results not typical*. Phenomenal burgers, hot dogs, CHOCOLATE CAKE, and even malts. Barnelli's is pretty great too. I mean its obviously not RPM Italian, but its fast & casual. The baked mostaccioli is so so so good. The outdoor seating is nice, especially when its hot and crowded inside.

If you go, and regularly, you can relate to the chocolate cake shake catch 22.
I think we can all agree that they're probably the best thing under the sun (also the unhealthiest).
If you don't get one, at the end of you meal you're sitting there full of sadness and regret.
However, if you do get one, by the end of your meal you feel sick, full of sadness, and regret.
Try one :)",1
705,"This is a must when we visit Chicago, we look forward to it so much. For the amount of people in the place they get the food out quickly. Went the day of the Christmas tree lighting parade and service was just as good as a normal day.",1
706,"Totally worth every penny. You can not order wrong here. I tried the normal hotdogs as well as the Italian beef sandwich with extra spicy peppers. I found the peppers to be the right amount of spiciness, but if you're not up to spicy, I would say try a small bite first.",1
707,"Best hot dogs around, and best roast beef.  When people visit Chicago, they have to try a Portillos.  It's all around the suburbs too but it's definitely a Chicago place not-to-miss.  Everything I've had here is good.  If you're a chocolate lover, get the cake-shake.",1
708,From the NYC metro area and am not usually a hot dog guy.  NY hotdogs are really different and I usually only eat 1 or 2 a year.  I ate 2 in one sitting at Portillo's.  Really good!,1

710,"I have eaten here twice. Chicago Hot Dogs and Italian Beef Sandwich. It was ok, not outstanding. I like the atmosphere though. I’d recommend it. Prices are a bit high but not bad.",1
711,"An institution, and a great stop for classic Chicago dogs and Italian beefs. Still, a long wait, a fairly crowded space, and prices somewhat higher than comparable offerings in the area. Definitely worth a visit, but maybe not as a mainstay.",1
712,Italian beef was pretty good but greasy. The atmosphere alone is worth the visit. They had Christmas lights and decorations up while playing old swing music. We loved it.,1

The dogs were good but not the best we'd eaten while we're in town. However, it was fun, just to say we'd been.",1
716,"It was okay. Ordering and getting your food can be chaotic especially during busy periods. I got the jumbo hot dog with everything, it was extremely bland, and the bun was super soggy.",0

This was the last decent location i knew of...I guess they all suck now. Bloomingdale, Hanover Park, Schaumburg, now downtown location! So sad to see you go! It was so crowded I didn't even have the energy to say something and wait another 25 mins for another. Nothing butt bad attitudes",0
720,"The ribs were very good,  but the strawberry cake was great.",1
721,"I'm writing this as I sit in the restaurant, fuming from the service. I'll start with the disorganized cluster of people that is supposed to be the two main lines to order food, pulling customers in no particular pattern left not only us, but other customers waiting in line 1 irritated by registers 2 and 3 only taking customers from line 2. Then, waiting for our food was where I began to lose my appetite as I watched less than enthused employees throw bags full of orders on the counter and stare rudely at all the waiting customers who were confused about what the guy with the radio was mumbling until I figured out that they were order numbers. Confused again at the layout of the different counters, my friend went to get a beer at the bar counter and I asked her to get me a Coke, apparently they don't serve them there. Thinking I had a Coke waiting, I walked to my dirty table where I was greeted by leftover food and trash from the day's previous customers and a message from my friend that's they didn't serve Coke at the bar. So rather than return to the cattle herd (aka lines 1 and 2) I walked to the sandwich/pasta/salad line to order a Coke, that's all, just a Coke. Simple right? Well not at Portillo's, I waited a good seven minutes before I just asked the girl, standing at the counter with her back to all of us, if I could just have my Coke. I got it, along with the only ""thank you"" from anyone in the joint.
We finish our dogs and fries, they were okay. Probably would have been better if I haven't let them sit for 15 minutes to get everything else we needed. Then I see chocolate cake, yum, I love chocolate cake... THEN I see chocolate cake SHAKE! ""Holy crap"", I thought. I walk to the dessert area, because chocolate cake shake, seems logical right? Well another five minute wait at an unmanned counter only to find out I was WRONG! ""At the bar or the main line"", I'm told... Well you already know my relationship with the main line, so I proceeded to the bar where a very grumpy old man just got finished pissing off the guy in front of me and takes me as his next challenger with a ""what do you want?"" attitude. ""Chocolate cake shake"", I tell him, and I kid you not, he rolls his eyes, disappears in a frenzy and reappears minutes later and slaps my shake with its lid half snapped on and mutters ""$3.90"" to me. I pay and make my way back to my trash heap, excuse me, TABLE, only to find out he was just as polite to my friend when she attempted to say ""hi"" to him when she ordered her beer. In conclusion, the makeup of the inside is entertaining, the food is okay, the service was terrible. Just get a street dog, save yourself the hassle.",0
722,The Italian beef dipped was amazing.  I almost ordered a second but I was stuffed from the first one.  Also the chocolate cake was amazing,1
723,"There are two restaurants under one roof. Portillo's for  hot dogs, beef, burgers, salads, fries and shakes. Barnellis serves more salads, ribs, sandwiches and pasta. We tried the beef sandwich, jumbo hot dog and jumbo chili cheese dog from Portillo's. Dessert was their seasonal lemon cake. They serve coke products, incredible shakes and malts. It's worth the stop on your foodie tour of the city!",1
724,"Went on labor day so this place was swamped. Don't know if the food justified the line/hectic nature. Hotdog was good with a poppey bun, but the other things we got were pretty greasy and gross (fries, shaved meat sandwich) but I still ate it so not a terrible score",1
725,"I'm honestly not a hot dog person but fell in love after taking a bite out of Portillo's beef famous hot dog!!!! They definitely live up to the famous Chicago dog name. The hotdog wasn't just a plain dog. It had relish and hot peppers on top. I had an order of fries for a side with cheese dip. Go big or go home!

The concept is, you order and pay for it. Then go to the other side to pick up your drinks and meals. It's kind of crazy in that area so listen carefully because your food gets cold. There are plenty of seatings! downstairs and upstairs and it's pack all through the day! Don't worry, people don't linger around after they're done.",1
726,"The Food is a solid 4.5 stars but the staff killed the experience for me. If you don't like your job than fake like you do or find another one. Maybe one that doesn't involve people. I was in Chicago for a business trip and my team was not from the states. I took the job of the food guide and tried to show them a little about Chicago seeing that it was my 5th time in the city. Portillo's not only has great food, it has great decor and atmosphere. I like eating there because the space feels thought out and on purpose unlike so many places I've been to. Past the food and interior decoration the experience falls apart. Rude, impatient and dismissive staff make you feel very unwelcomed. From the moment we step in line we are forced to deal with a woman who obviously hates her job or people or both for that matter. We needed a minute to decide on our order as I was explaining the menu to my foreign guests. There was no one behind us so there was no rush. I mentioned that they aren't from The states and need a second. The face she made was uncalled for. Relax and wait a damned second and be thankful you have a job. Why do we have to deal with your hatred for what you do? Getting refills or condiments was another fiasco all together with the staff looking ""too busy"" to do their jobs and when forced with doing their jobs do it with the least amount of enthusiasm or professionalism possible. I'm just happy I enjoyed my food immensely as that is the only thing that saved the experience.",1
727,Awesome food and customer service!,1
728,"My favorite fast food restaurant ever, sorry Culver's. Everything is good and be sure to order the cheese fries",1
729,"Just want to say that my last visit to this location was pretty bad and not sure I will revisit again. Would recommend anyone to select a different location.

I was craving Portillo’s for weeks, but I live up north so it takes some effort to get down the River North location. Finally I found time to head down there, looking forward to that amazing double bacon cheeseburger and fires.

When my buddy and I went to the counter to order our food, the waitress was pretty rude and made us wait as she talked about her plans for the weekend with another co-worker. She decided to wrap it up and take our order. It was a usual wait time and the lady&guy who rhyme about the I see numbers are awesome. Unfortunately when I get back home I was surprised to find out that the fries were half cooked, and the double bacon cheeseburger I ordered was missing the hamburger!!!!! How can this possibly happen, Portillos sold me a lettuce bacon cheese sandwich...are you kidding me! As much as I love Portillos, this is unacceptable and I’m not sure I will be back.",0
730,"The place was so busy looking, it was hard to concentrate on figuring out what I wanted to eat. I went to Portillo's on my birthday almost two weeks ago and I had a jumbo chili cheese dog. It was soooo good! The atmosphere is so lively, I will definitely go back.",1
731,A staple definitely worth trying!,1
732,"I find the drive through here super annoying.  One of my favorite things to get is a hot dog (or two).  Because parking is almost a no go in the area, one is relegated to drive up.  If you get hot dogs, however, they bring your food out and you sit behind other people who have more complicated orders and your food gets cold.  There is usually no way to get around them so you sit and wait and wait... and arrive home with room temperature food.  They need to bring the food out IN ORDER.  The food is good, however!",1
733,"Best hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches in the city. Don't buy into the hype of Al's and these other ""top ten"" places. Portillo's is a local place that has done well for a reason ... it has great fast food.",1
734,"WOW! Messy and Delicious. Busy place, tasty food, cool atmosphere. Must  eat.",1
735,"Took a group of 53 here Wednesday.  The staff was awesome, they never skipped a beat and handled the group plus their normal customers perfectly.  The food was great and I wish Momma T was everywhere I go.",1
736,Amazing food great prices.,1
737,"I was a fat kid in heaven.. The menu is outstanding remember to look at both menu's before making your choice. The Italian beef and cheese crossiant was outstanding, great hot dogs and big ol cold beer. The decor is awesome, staff is great and cool place to people watch. Yes I'll be back!",1
738,"Coming from VA and had never had an Italian beef sandwich, this place was an eye opening experience. I've spent the last couple weeks trying to replicate the flavor. Fun place and definitely worth a visit.",1
739,"First time visiting and loved it, great food and fun atmosphere. Staff was on top if it and fun as well.",1
740,"Beat dogs in Chicago, but in reality idk, I'm not from here",1
741,"It was okay but not worth the hype, the hot dog tasted just like any other hot dog and was not hot and the service ain’t that good coz it’s more a takeaway than sit in restaurant.",1
742,My server Deja seemed cranky and did not like her job.  First time ever coming and she began my experience with a bad mood:(. Food was ok but we make Italian beef at home so it wasn’t an oooh and aww experience especially dealing with cranky cashiers.  Not a try it again place or tell others to try kind of place for us.,1
743,"The food was phenomenal! However, Cherida has a very bad attitude she had a very bad attitude and rushed me to order my food. Not only that, she sent me to the wrong place to pick up my food. Very bad customer service.",1
744,"My wife & I are visiting Chicago for the first time & we were looking for the true flavor of Chicago.
Portillo's more than filled the bill. The resturant was so busy & vibrant with the local lunch crowd that we knew we were in the right place.
My wife & I had the Portillo's Dog, I had two plus a combo Italian beef/sausage sandwich.
With a couple of ice cold beers from the tap on my table, I was in complete heaven. The food was beyond good. My wife & I are in our hotel room with our mouths still watering from today's meal.
I had the pleasure to meet Mama T in the dining room. What a sweetheart!! We need more nice people like her in this world. She made me feel most welcome & she was very happy that we had ventured from Rosarito Beach, Mexico to visit Chicago. I told her with food like Portillo's we need to come back soon.
Thank you to all of the crew that made our taste of Chicago one that we will never forget.

Much Love,

Tony & Linda Gaines",1
745,"Visiting Chicago from NYC, I read that this was the spot for Chicago Style Hot Dog! So I took the train and walk like 15 min to Portillos, to find out that the SERVICE IS TERRIBLE! Employees there definitely hate their jobs, specially an old man serving in the alcohol area (beers and cocktails). I mean, I’m educated, so when I approached the counter I SAID: “HI, HOW ARE YOU?” This old man stared at me cold faced, no even a smile, no even a: “What can I get you?” He just muted waited till I had to order myself without any response, like a robot, he served my drink and the only thing coming out from his mouth was the price for the drink... wow! Even the guy behind me on the line told me: “How rude, he doesn’t even smile at all”. Too sad for you guys! I won’t ever come back!
Also the service by the food was terrible, everyone waiting for food around 45 min...
“Chicago Hot Dog” wasn’t bad, but I won’t spend my money on salaries for rude employees and bad service like this.",0
746,Really neat place. Good food,1
747,"Loved all of it...the place (well distanced tables!), the food, and the value.  Can't wait to visit again.  No wonder so many people love this place...count me one of them.",1
748,"Food is good, but I brought in a bus load of 50 kids, i was about 3rd in line to order (on the barnellis side).  I ordered a chicken caprese panini, fries and a coke...and damn near ALL 50 kids got their orders before mine came out.  Stick to the pasta or hot dogs if youre looking for something quick ....",0
749,"Food is great, of course, it's a classic. However, they looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for a normal fountain water instead of bottled water, although they gave me a small cup eventually.",1
750,"My family and I came here for our family reunion. The food was so good and fresh. Connie, Deja and Wesley worked our area and made sure we had what we needed and plenty of it. I am more then pleased with the food and staff. I will surely return when I'm back in Chicago.",1
751,"Best hot dogs in Chicago, really American style place with really good food. You can pick what you want, best hot dogs, burgers, sandwiches and even ribs. Highly recommended",1
752,"The staff are all very friendly. I think the food is really good, I have only gotten the italian beef and friends and chocolate milkshake. It is pretty overhyped I think but it's a good restaurant. I can definitely see why Chicagoans really like it.",1
753,My girlfriend and I got here around 12:30 and it was Valentine’s Day. Online it said it closed at 2 but the bouncers at the door were very rude and said it closed at 12. We have never experienced such rude customer service. We expected amazing service yet were met with iron doors of men who showed no sympathy.,0
754,"My wife and kids first time at Portillo's!! I had been raving about the one in Mishawaka!!

Same menu but there are two lines one for Portillo's and one for Barnelli's and the food comes out from different points!! A bit weird and my wife's ribs came out 10 mins before our dogs!!

The dogs are tasty and great value for money - I especially love the Maxwell Street Polish, but the regular is fantastic too!

The only thing I don't like is the hanging around waiting for your food, it seems a little chaotic!! I don't quite understand why it is all over the place, but it will not stop me going there!!",1
755,"Some locals inside could tell I was from out of town. They let me know-- in good fun-- that I was limited to dogs or Italian beef. I'm glad they did, because not only is Italian beef delicious, but it added to the really fun atmosphere is this really cool place.",1
756,Stopped here because of a recommendation from my brother in law and 😋😋😋! 10/10 a stop to make while in downtown Chicago.,1
757,"Drive through service has the attention and service of employees and they keep it moving.   Just check your orders. We were missing 3 small fries although they had them,  they just didn't give them to us.",1
758,"Nice, clean, kid friendly great food and service.",1
759,"Fun fair of Chicago foods with lots of sports memorabilia hanging on all the walls! NO loitering!!! Order at one counter and pickup from another. Eat your meals, bus your tables, don’t sit around once your finished so you can make way for the next diners.",1
760,"We went to Portillo's based on reviews and were very disappointed. Rubbery hot dogs and the cake shake was practically all cake and no shake. Not to mention the mass chaos waiting for our order.

Would'nt go back again. Overrated",0
761,The food is hot and fresh majority of the time. If you’re missing something the employees are very helpful.,1
762,"Stand in line, order your food, and sit down cafeteria style. Being it was my first time it was a bit confusing but the staff made up for it!",1
763,Granted it was busy but how long does it take to cook a hotdog and polish sausage? Check your order before you walk away otherwise you have to fight your way back through the crowd to get it fixed.  Visit the burbs for faster service,1
764,"Portillo's is the best value friendly restaurant in Chicago. The chocolate milkshakes, hot dogs, and french fries are AMAZING! The atmosphere is family friendly and the service is extremely quick. If you come to Chicago you have to try the Chicago style hot dog at Portillo's before you leave!",1
765,"I used drive-thru.  Their speed team that takes your order while your in the que is impressive considering the lack of space.
My order; A Portillo Hot Dog (running thru the garden), A tamale (a hidden treasure), and to balance the meal an Iced.Tea.
Everything thing was as expected!
F A N T A S T I C",1
766,"Smallest hot dog for a ""jumbo hot dog"" ate it in 2 bites. Line ups are madness, dont feel like lining up again for seconds. Had to have a second meal elsewhere. Chocolate cake was 7$ so not worth it.",0
767,"This is one of the places I always have to stop when I find myself in Chicago. The Italian beef is awesome! This location is great because it also has pasta, definitely recommend the meatballs.",1
768,"Bad tasteless food. Staff with a terrible Attitude, waste of money. Won’t ever come back! The hot dog was meh, Italian beef was real bad, burger was burnt, fries over-salted & cold & soggy, choc cake shake was too sugary & meh,, i just wasted 29$ wish i had eaten some place else.. we waited for the food for over half an hour.. :/",0
769,Do not order here for delivery! I ordered a chicken caesar salad and a cake shake but didn’t get the shake and there was no chicken on the salad. I was able to get a refund through the delivery app but I really just wanted my shake :(,0
770,I've been coming here since I can remember and it's for a good reason.  No matter which Portillo's you go to you can expect the same great food.  Not like some places that the taste varies from location to location.  Personally this is my favorite beef sandwich in the city and I never get tired of any of their food really.  I even have friends that moved to the west coast and have it shipped to them regularly.,1
771,I ordered the catered pan of Chicken Al’Diavolo for Christmas Eve and it was EXTREMELY DRY! I called to ask for a Manager she said her name was Emily and that she would find my order...she never came back to phone and the call mysteriously got disconnected!!! What a big disappointment for Dinner. I would prefer to give NEGATIVE STARS but it doesn’t allow the option,0
772,"At peak times it's absolute madness. The line's out the door and you wait in a giant crowd to pick up your good. We waited over half an hour for ours. It's just not set up for that kind of volume. That said, the Chicago dog was very good. But I wouldn't have bothered if I knew what a hassle it would be.",0
773,"Only one word comes to mind when describing Portillo's, amazing. From ""the old timey"" decor and busy yet calming atmosphere for eating. If you're new to Chicago and wanting to get a feel for the city, stop on by Portillo's Hot Dogs! I promise you'll leave stuffed and full of joy!",1
774,"Bad guest experience, waited an hour for a single hot dog. Poor job by employees to recognize this mistake and fill my order. I will recommend that any person visiting Chicago to not visit this establishment.",0
775,There were far too many employees behind the counter... It took 20 min for 1 Chicago dog. The lady calling out the orders could stop coughing. The 3 starts was only for the great look of the place.,1
776,"Fabulous cornerstone of Chicago's finest foods from hotdogs grazed through the garden, to sloppy beef sandwiches, to milkshakes. It's like stepping into an Americana wonderland filled with old school decor, road signs, and folk art. Always a must stop when in the Windy city.",1
777,"To be honest, I don't really get why everybody loves Portillo's so much. I guess it's kind of a campy, but fun atmosphere with all the weird hanging mannequins, eccentric things, old clocks, Cubs gate signs and all that... but their hot dogs are just meh--- there's no flavor to the actual meat, and it tastes like it came from one of the 8 pack Ballpark hot dogs you can get in the grocery store. But I guess the toppings make it somewhat edible and cover up the bland taste.

Luckily, I got the Char-Grilled Maxwell Street Polish dog, which redeemed this dining experience for me. It was grilled on the outside and extremely juicy on the inside, and I couldn't get enough of the grilled onions that came with it! I wish I had just ordered two of these, but next time!

If I have out of towners coming to Chicago again, I'll get the Italian beef next time... and the Polish dog again!",1
778,"First heard this place in Gabriel iglesias' special I knew I just had to go.

The chocolate cake shake is everything he hyped it up to be. The Italian beef and sausage combo is amazing to",1
779,"Be prepared.  It's like being in a restaurant in Disney.  It's a complete mad house. Then they forgot to give us half our order, after we waited thirty minutes for it. Then to get it fixed they make you wait in line again, another thirty min. Couldn't even say forget it and just get my money back without waiting in that line again.  And then after you wait there's not even an apology for your inconvenience.  Absolutely horrible customer service.  I know they're busy but that in no way should excuse the lack of customer service. Food is ok, maybe even good. Definitely not worth the wait.",0
780,"Best Chicago style hot dog I had in Chicago. Go for the experience alone and make sure to try their root beer, too. I had a blast in the hour I spent eating my meal and visiting with the Kinda Funny Games crew meetup.",1
781,Italian beef dipped with cheese was to die for!,1
782,5 stars isn't enough tbh,1
783,"Came here this past weekend after hearing that this was the place to come for a chicago dog.  Was confused by the ordering system almost immediately, but placed our order and my wife went and found a table while I waited for our food.  Probably 20 minutes to get 2 hotdogs, fries, and a drink.  Got back to my table and realized there was only 1 hotdog in the bag.  Went back to the counter and it took probably 15 minutes and asking multiple times for it to be corrected.  I have to agree that their crazy write on the bag ordering system does not work.  Bags of food were all over the place.  Also the lady at the counter would call out probably 10 numbers at a time and whoever got her attention first is who would get their food first.  Would never recommend this place or go there again.",0
784,"It's been waaay too long since I've had the artery-clogging meal that Portillo's does so well! I finally got a chance while visiting a friend. As I expected, the place was packed with a line towards - no surprise there. Once I finally got to the ordering window, I got my usual: a double bacon cheeseburger, large cheese fries and a small chocolate cake shake. Although the prices are a bit steeper than I remember, it was worth every damn penny! The staff is hella friendly and fast with the orders and it was only a matter of time until I found myself devouring this monstrosity of a meal in the dining area.

My burger was delicious - just like I remember with grease and cheese dripping off onto the wrapper. Excuse me while I clean up the drool off my keyboard. OK, I'm back - the fries were crispy on the outside and soft and velvety inside with the gooey cheese sauce, I dunno what else could be a better combination. I washed all this down with my super thick chocolatey cake shake. It's incredibly rich so make sure you order a water as a chaser haha!

All in all, I had an awesome lunch and can't wait until I can go back again!",1
785,"Great location for authentic Chicago hot dogs and sandwiches. I always stick to the classic, and it is fantastic. The fries are the best i have had.",1
786,"Blah.....I’ve dined at this location for years. Most recently the food has tasted terrible-cheese is not melted, fries are cold and hard, and the burger tasted like a true fast food burger. It’s unfortunate, but I guess this is the current state of affairs since the business was sold.",1
787,"Plenty of options for some good American-cuisine. Good place to come for a cheat day. I wouldn't not come here if I was looking for healthy options.

I was recommended (by my boss and Chicago food veteran) to get the Beef Dipped optional Hot, Everything Hotdog, Cheese Fries and  Chocolate Cake Shake.

One down side is that sometimes they take too long to get an order out and they forgot my hotdogs for which I had to end up waiting another 10 mins or so.",1
788,The dipped Italian beef is... Perfect. I would order that to be shipped to Florida so I can share with friends!,1
789,"Definitely lives up to its reputation. I did not get a hot dog, but the onion rings, burgers, and chicken tenders were good. The staff there was super friendly and funny.",1
790,"Food was good, very tight place to get into and your usually left in the street.",1
791,"Italian Beef Dipped. End of story. Get a Portillo's Style Dog if you're really feeling hungry. Fries are also delicious. Service is meh, but you don't go there for the service. You go there to get authentic Chicago food while being yelled at on a PA system that makes the numbers incomprehensible.",1
792,"A Chicago classic!  If you're from out of town, you should definitely stop in for an Italian beef sandwich or Chicago-style hot dog!  Even though this downtown location always draws a crowd, there's always a place to sit by the time your food is up.  I've had their food catered for events a handful of times and it was really good offsite as well!",1
793,Went to Portillo's for lunch today.  Impressed by the size of the place and how busy it was .  I ordered Polish sausage and other members of my family ordered beef sandwich and chicken portabella mushrooms sandwich and others.   The cashier DxShxi seems to be very tired and lack of energy.   She had 1 hand supporting her cheek and working with one hand only.   She wasn't very attentive and mixed up our order.  She missed 1 drink order and put in regular chicken sandwich instead of portabello mushrooms sandwich.   I liked the Polish sausage with mustard and also the Onion that went with it.   The sausage itself tastes just like the Polish sausage at Costco.  However the sausage casing was snappy and that was quite interesting.   French fries were soso.  I would recommend the Polish sausage over the regular hotdogs and make sure you check the receipt after ordering to make sure the cashier input the correct orders.  4 stars for food and deducted 1 for the lackluster front line cashier,1
794,Portillos Hot Dog's is a classic. Whether you get a Chicago style hot dog with cheese fries or a wrap you won't regret it. They have a great staff and good prices along with a want atmosphere.,1
795,This place is magic!!  The combo polish sausage Italian beef sandwich is the bomb!!!!,1
796,"2 words to describe this place. ""Organized Chaos"". This landmark has stood the test of time and remains one of the busiest eateries in Chicago. This multi-level compound is enormous but still get so packed that you might have to wait for a table, but definitely not for food. Portillo's has certainly mastered the art of efficiency.

Upon entering the building, you are immediately surrounded by different food stations which are clearly marked with bright neon signs. They have frozen custard, ribs, burgers, Italian sausage and of course, their signature Chicago style hotdogs. And that's what we came here for.

Despite the long lines, we got our food pretty quick so don't be discouraged. The staff will direct you to the correct line, writes your order on a paper bag, then hands them to the cashier. While you get funneled towards the pick-up line, you can watch the ""behind the scenes"" fast action from the see-through glass. This kitchen line really hustles to churn out orders with extreme efficiency. Just don't record because the managers don't allow it.

We both got the Chicago hotdogs and side of fries. Not sure if they were the best hotdogs but they were pretty satisfying. Great snap from the dogs too. Just sitting there in the middle room while checking out the quirky décor was entertaining enough. It's definitely a place that can't be missed especially for first time visitors.",1
797,A fun way to experience a Chicago style hot dog!,1
798,"Walked up to order and took about 45 minutes to get food. They forgot three items we ordered, tried to get those items at the counter and were dismissed by the cashiers. Didn’t get the food we ordered and no one would speak to us about our messed up order. Would recommend against this restaurant if you can avoid it.",0
799,Consistently good hot dog and fries,1
800,Easily one of the coolest restaurants I have been to. The inside is amazing. The food is also very delicious and fair priced considering its downtown. I ordered the Chicago style dog and let me tell ya... YUM!,1
801,"Wait time is too long.  But other than that, excellent.",1
802,One of my favorite stops in Chicago. It has a cool atmosphere and delicious hot dogs. And according to friends we missed out on the chocolate cake,1
803,"Great place for hot dogs and burgers!  Classic Chicago style hot dogs.  The onion rings are a must!  Also, the chocolate cake is amazing (even if it has mayo in it). Milkshakes are good for the heart and soul!",1
804,"A Chicago must.
Good price per serving. Might want to order online on your way there since the line could be something serious",1
805,"Ordered a chili dog n chocolate malt shack
Chili dog was classic lil messy but delicious. Chocolate malt was ok seemed like it wasn't mixed properly the bottom of my drink was looking drinking straight Hershey's syrup.",1
806,"The burgers are good and the milkshakes are also amazing. However, the main thing they lack is a divisive menu, which means they have very little food choices.",1
807,"For an okay hotdog it was pretty outrageous to have to wait 45 minutes between ordering and actually receiving the food, all standing! Definitely not planning on going back again and would recommend Devil Dawgs to anyone who is looking for better and more convenient hto dogs in the area.",0
808,"Awesome decision to place this next to a mcdonalds making the decision to either eat or choke on rat patties easy! For the same price (often cheaper) you can choose to enjoy your food and vow to come back.
The burgers are awesome, and for some reason I can't stop eating the breaded chicken sandwiches!!",1
809,"First time trying Chicago style hotdogs and I was convinced that mustard doesn't belong on a hotdog. It was so good I ate a second one, also truly iconic and the best part of my trip to Chicago. When the pandemic ends, I know will definitely be coming back here again.",1
810,It was just ok.  Servers didn't seem to know the menu or how to communicate. The cheese fries were just very ordinary fries with a side of nacho dipping cheese sauce.  Italian beef sandwich was decent but very pricey,0
811,Literally messed up the order multiple times. Slow as all hell and can't ever get a damn order right.,0
812,One of  Chicago's best places to eat. The Italian beef sandwich is the best. They have a huge salad and soup bar as well as a milk shake station. The staff is very helpful.,1
813,"I love the atmosphere of this place!! The food is great as well, good hot dogs and burgers. Even though the place is big it still feels cozy enough. If your visiting Chicago it's defenilty a place I recommend checking it out!!",1
814,"It was just OK, but I will caveat I'm from Texas. Ordered the Italian beef, wet, and it was definitely an experience. I would recommend getting the ""wet"" on the side rather than having the sandwich dipped.",1
815,Best place to eat in Chicago if your craving hotdogs,1
816,"The food is fine, maybe slightly overpriced, but the service is awful.  The rude slow folks behind the counter should switch places with the polite efficient ones cleaning in the dining room.  I guess the theory is that it doesn't matter if tourists are treated badly since they may never come back again anyway?",0
817,"There's something different and unique about the cheeseburgers that you can't get elsewhere. Other than a few standouts on the menu, it's pretty standard Chicago foods dressed up like a tourist trap (not that is isn't beloved by plenty of locals).",1
818,Thank you so much diane/diana for being the worst employee to have for my first time there! I know you'll know who i am since i made it very clear it was my first time there and apologized about the questions ahead of time. You made such a simple operation super difficult. Cant help but to think you had something to do with our food sitting for 17 minutes without our number getting called out..had to ask someome to check on order number after patiently waiting only to find out the bag was right in front of their faces. Food was super yummy but dont appreciate the hassle for it... Boyfriend and i havent decided if its worth going back yet.,1
819,"Always some of the best food in Chicago. No matter what you get though, You HAVE to get a Chocolate Cake Shake. It's a must in Chicago like Chicago style hot dogs and chicago style pizza.",1
820,"Great visit, loved the food! Just wish the upstairs seating area was open. There were no seats left for our family of 6, so we had no choice but to sit outside. Really wanted to enjoy the experience inside ...",1
821,"A Chicago must try.  Love the chili dogs, Italian beef and the chicken chopped salad (extra dressing) is a winner.  Chocolate cake is ridiculously good.",1
822,"I mainly love the downtown Chicago location (by HardRockCafe) due to my own personal story behind my first time there back in 2010 ..... me (a vegetarian at the time)  and my doggo (definitely about the meats)  on his first road trip and we're downtown after visiting the lake..... starving..... and I have no idea where to try and eat but I remember the big McDonald's downtown and really really really wanted fries.  That's it.  Fries.   And I found myself in a really long line that I thought was for McDonald's.
Duke was getting super excited as we edged closer to our destination...... and we pull into the drive and I realize we're in line for a hotdog joint!!    I couldn't believe I'd been sitting in this line in my car for as long as I had only to find myself in the wrong line and waiting for not McDonald's fries but a hotdog place.     But ahhhh well.   Get the dog a dog and get the vegetarian some onion rings.  And laugh.   Lol.
So now we stop by to get a hotdog when Duke and I roll through Chicago.
Thanks Portillo's 🥰

P.s.  the pasta and salads and whatnot from the place with it are delish 😋

P.s.s. Duke is always sleeping in the back seat while we're waiting in line usually",1
823,Italian beef was good. Hit dogs and pasta were good.  So we're the onion rings.  The place wasn't super clean...it was busy so understandable.,1
824,"Fast service, but had to walk back to get the rest of the food, they forgot several food items.",1
825,"Awesome classic Chicago food! The chocolate cake, beef sandwich and hot dogs are a must! The decor is really cool and the wait isn't long.",1
826,It was quite good and the atmosphere was enjoyable and different.,1
827,Sooooooooo good! My first time to Chicago and I took recommendations from Facebook friends. Many said to go to Portillo's. Glad I did. The beef sandwich. Simple. A little messy. But so good!,1
828,"I’ve lived in the city for a week, as of yesterday. Today, my friends and I drove to this Portillo’s, debating between Portillo’s and the Buffalo Wild Wings across the street. We pulled into the lot from Clinton Street, heading south, behind two other cars, making any possible signage on the 5 foot fence around the lot invisible. There is no other visible signage in the parking lot. After arriving, and parking, and searching for somewhere to pay unsuccessfully, my friend opted for wings over hot dogs and we walked across the street. In the 35 minutes we were across the street my car was towed. From a lot full of open spots. As I walked back to where my car had been, I watched two more tow trucks pick up cars in the lot. If you park there, you are not allowed to leave the premises. Super, but they should really put it on a sign I or anyone in the lot, could see. Called the tow truck facility, not at all related to the local police but instead contracted through Portillo’s who receives a cut for every car towed, cost me over $400 to get my car back. Looks like I’ll spend my first month in Chicago eating ramen, instead of Chicago dogs, as a college grad who really didn’t have $400 to lose. Glad that Portillo’s as an establishment cares more about their empty (at 6:00 on a weeknight) parking lot than the welfare of potential customers, or human beings in general, and are more concerned with making money. I won’t ever eat here, and just wanted people to know what kind of a place this is before they walk in the door. And if you’re nearby, don’t park in this lot because as soon as you turn around your car will be gone. Thanks Portillo’s! Really I had a great time.",0
829,"I ordered my lunch ahead of time and told them when I arrived as instructed on the website. They told me to sign my name on the catering sheet ? Didn’t even ask if I was grub hub or catering, just assumed. I proceeded to stand there for 10 min waiting and it turned out my order was ready the whole time. Absolute madness and zero organization at this Portillos. Don’t order ahead of time, you’ll spend the same time going in to order.",0
830,"Good service. Great food. It of course took FOREVER during the dinner rush but that is what you will experience at any portillos. They deffinitely get really busy during peak hours so be prepared to wait. They work very hard though, and are clearly doing their best to get everyone there food as quick as possible.",1
831,Foods soooo good and well priced! Excellent place to start and end a trip with! Thanks for the great service!,1
832,"Extremely busy. There must be tastier fares -- in the hot dog realm -- a middle of the road beef hot dog. A place that remains in tour books and guides but doesn't because of the food itself. If you're going through s to-do while in chicsgo, like we were (how lame!), your trip will be undiminished if you go to another joint and don't see Portillo's. Nonetheless, a fine time.",1
833,Best Chicago style dog we had! I could've eaten here the entire time we visited with all the options they had. This is a true must-do if you're in Chicago and not a vegetarian.,1
834,"I was referred to dine here during my visit. long wait time at restaurant,  so came back to hotel and order online. Delivery was fast,  but I wasn't impressed with the food",1
835,This is a very famous place in Chicago that is why I have been here. I can feel real American style in here.,1
836,If your in town visiting and don't go to Portillo's then you've done everything wrong. At the time of writing this review there are 560 reviews.... that should say enough. Born in Chicago and live three blocks away can be dangerous because I've never had a bad or mediocre meal and definitely go too much.  See you soon!,1
837,Great place for Chicago Style Hot Dogs. The chocolate cake is moist and delicious. I was there with a group from Canada and they went back for seconds and thirds. I enjoy the ribs.,1
838,"Definitely worth checking this historic place out while in Chicago. Don't expect a romantic dinner here, it is really meant for quick bites. Their polish dogs are to die for!",1
839,Best Italian beef I've ever had. Wanted it dipped in gravy but they didn't. Still the best. Service was weird. No way to tell them I didn't get exactly what I ordered.,1
840,"This portillo's location is great! it has a great decor, relatively large (at least bigger inside than what it looks like on the outside) and quick service. The food is amazing and at good prices. I would recommend the char-broiled chicken sandwich and a chocolate shake. There is no parking nearby so I would just recommend taking the EL or bus.",1
841,The food is very cold and not fresh,0
842,"2* for bad service. They forgot to give me my order. Had to wait for 20 minutes straight.

So I went back, during non rush hours, in an attempt to not draw conclusions from one visit, and was met with the same disappointment. They forgot my order again, even though I was one of the only 3 people waiting. I had to remind them to give me my order, which was just one cake shake, after which they got someone to make it for me. Really poor service",0
843,"Fast food garbage. You could get better Chicago style hotdogs from a kids hotdog stand in their parents driveway. The experience sucked. People who recommended this place are clueless. This isn't a museum, this is where you eat food and there are much better places to eat.",0
844,"OMG. The wait was soooo long, the drive thru lines were not clearly marked, they only had ONE carhop to take orders. People who were ""walking up"" in the drive thru received their food before the 8 cars that had ordered before them. THEN, the poor girl who was bringing us our food, Kept giving the wrong orders to the wrong cars. When we did finally receive our food, we got 3 onion rings, instead of the 2 that ordered,  I'm not complaining about that,  the Food was hot and great. They just move too slow and the setup Sucks.",0
845,"SERIOUS NOTE: wanted to add a short note preceeding my reciew. This is a busy fast food joint in a downtown area. This Portillos location attracts lots of tourists; tourists are targets. You will tend to see panhandlers and other people looking to make some easy money near the restaurant because of this. As with any place in this environment, you should protect and keep an eye on your belongings. Do not leave things on the table and leave for the restroom. Do not hang your purse on your chair. Take care to avoid bumping into people. Be aware of those who get close to you.

Anyway, that aside, this place is awesome. It has great charm inside and is deceptively large. Tons of seating is available. There are different counters for dessert, salads, dogs/sandos, and beer. This keeps lines short and things moving. The employees are courteous and all cooking is done right on the other side of the glass. No closed doors cooking here.

We got some Italian beefs, jumbo dogs, fries, sweet peppers, and beers. The food was all amazing. I'd go super extra sauce on the Italian beef next time, and lots of spicy peppers on the dog. The beertenders don't really know the beers so don't go up expecting them to tell you something like ""what lagers do you have?""

Our toddler had the regular dog with cheddar cheese and ketchup, some of our extra fries, and a milk. It was a perfect (if slightly large) kid's meal.",1
846,Cool place! Fast service considering how busy it was already at 10:45 am on a random Tuesday. Classic Chicago hot dog experience. Just what the vacation called for!,1
847,"Food was great as always. However, the lady taking orders in line 12/28/16 @8:40PM got impatient when our group was ordering and rudley told us to finish the order at the register because we were ""holding up the line"" as she rolled her eyes and walked away. She didn't want to do her job which ruined the experience.",0
848,"It's always busy but you should double check your orders. 1st time I went back they forgot 3 items in my order. 2nd time they made my Italian beef's wrong. Dry and hot peppers (got wet and peppers), wet only (got wet with hot peppers). Love portillo's but disappointed",1
849,Busy but quick service and food was good!,1
850,"I almost didn’t go to Portillo’s b/c I thought, it’s a hotdog, how good can it be. I was wrong! Definitely happy I got to experience the best dog ever! This will be a must every time I come to Chicago! Bonus: I got to meet Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) who was going to the drive though to get a dog of his own!!!",1
851,"This place lies about their hours. Their automatic message as well as google says they are open till 1am on weekdays, and upon arrival their doors were locked. I then called the store and the manager rudely told me that this was not her problem that they did not list their true hours and only their drive thru was open. This needs to be updated on your voicemail as well as on Google in order to be a reputable restaurant. Until you fix this issue me and my associates will NOT be visiting this establishment.",0
852,"My friend insisted on going here so we did. We arrived around 3pm and it was packed. There were multiple lines - one was for desserts but the other lines weren't so easy to figure out. I managed to order my food - a regular hotdog - and I moved over to wait with about 50 others for our numbers to be called. A simple hotdog took them 30 minutes to wait and it was one of the most underwhelming hotdogs I've ever had. My friend ordered an Italian beef sandwich and that ended up being much bigger, although very messy to eat. Needlessly to say, I will not be coming back here as this place is just way too popular for its own good.",0
853,"Great place to enjoy a Friday night with anyone. But be wary that you may wait a bit for your order. Recommend to avoid to come during lunch unless you order ahead of time. With that in mind, enjoy the view and have a great meal!",1
854,"Cheap food, yeah, super delicious. service is always excellent even when they have a full house. the staff was very helpful and observant. it has a great atmosphere. ambience reminds me of san diego's scene.",1
855,I ordered the new spicy chicken sandwich and I was not disappointed. The order was quick and easy and I enjoyed the chicken!,1
856,"Great food, Italian beef & sausage combo - yummy!!!",1
857,The Italian beef with sausage is great. The hot peppers really was the  finishing touch. I found a new favorite dish.,1
858,"Portillos is a must do in Chicago. The Chicago dog was fantastic! The peppers on there were a terrific bonus, just a tiny bit of spice. The italian beef & sausage sandwich was just ok. We've gotten similar at a chicago style restaurant at home and both taste the same, but a little bland. Will not get the italian beef again",1
859,"Tasteless beef. Not dipped as ordered & wayyyy too busy to get it fixed.  Snotty, bored girl taking our order in line. My first time at Portillos & I was so disappointed. They were definitely having a bad day.",0
860,"The best dogs in the city, yes!",1
861,"Definitely a must-go when in the Windy City.  If you want to get a famous Chicago Dog, this is where you have to go.  The Italian Beef here is also very very good. This place is also great to take kids too, it's super chill.",1
862,"Where do I start,  well first off it was absolutely a chaotic mess in there. When you walk in and give your order, you have to wait with about a fifty-seventy-five other people in a small area, for them to call your number.  There is no good system sit up to make it easy.  Then it took 40 minutes to receive our food and drinks, because they don't give you the drinks while you wait.  They pre make the drinks, so they sit and get watered down on the counter. Then if you walk up, (let's say because they called 108 and you thought they said 128 with the other 5-8 numbers they rambled out), the lady was very rude and tells you to get back if your number has not been called.  Might I add, she was not nice to anyone either.  So finally after fighting through the crowd to get our food when our number was actually called, the food sucked!  The chili dogs was a freaking mess, it was wrapped in paper and the whole entire bun was  a mess.  They did not put it in a container so that it could be eaten with a fork, mom was seriously disappointed!  The Italian beef was so greasy, the grease actually dripped through entire bun.  I threw it away after attempting a couple of bites, but got seriously nauseas because of all the grease. (not to mention it was very bland).  My daughter  did say the hot dogs (plain) were good, but nothing special!  Anyway, if you are walking to this place from say the navy pier, do not waste your time, like we did.  In fact, I would recommend eating at Mcdonald's before here.",0
863,"Portillo's is a Chicago experience like no other. You really need to try it to understand why. Make sure you LISTEN FOR YOUR ORDER NUMBER TO BE CALLED or you might go hungry. (Orders may not be called sequentially). Give their Italian beef a try or if you prefer to veg out, try some fries or a salad.",1
864,"I heard about this place from a friend, didn't realize that it gets pretty busy here. We waited about 10 mins for our hotdogs. The hot dogs were good, but it's kind of hard to mess up a hot dog a long as you have decent ingredients.",1
865,"Best hot dogs in the world!  The atmosphere is great as well, for a fast food type of place.  Beef is arguably the best in the city as well.  Would sorely miss this place if I ever moved.",1
866,I actually used to work at another location when I was in high school and nothing I saw made me want to stop eating their food. I can't think of anything on the menu I don't like. The beef and dogs are amazing. If you want a healthier option the chopped salad would be my recommendation.,1
867,Great place! Loved the hot-dogs and  the onion rings. I can imagine this in a Monday lunch. WOW. Too bad you have to wait in the line again to order if you want more. I felt like I needed to eat 3 more because they where awesome ;p,1
868,We tried the hot dogs here as part of our culinary tour of Chicago. They weren't anything special. We also tried the Italian beef sandwiches. It's much better at Al's Beef.,1
869,"Yeah, it's good. Daytime, nighttime. Anytime. Burgers, Italian beef, fries. Not sure what else anyone could need.",1
870,On time. So fresh. Very tasty!,1
871,"Very well known, this place is a must go to try and taste the famous Chicago hot dog.

The atmosphere is great and the sandwich really nice.

It's also not expensive at all so you can go there!",1
872,"Girlfriend and I had been going here a while, but had a recent experience that has deterred us from going back.  Gonna try to provide our experience as accurately and concisely as possible here, because I believe that management needs to read it.

We ordered 2 ravioli orders and a salad to share, to go.  We waited for about 20 mins, which is much longer than usual but it was a busy night so we didnt want to complain.  Our number was finally called and there was just a salad in the bag. We assumed the rest was coming, but 10 minutes later were frustrated. Had a hard time getting anybody's attention, and when we did, it took a while for a manager to come ask what our issue was. He then talked to others in the back, came back out to us, and asked if anybody had talked to us about the fact that they were out of ravioli. No, in fact nobody told is yall were out of ravioli, but would have been nice to know 20 minutes prior. The manager asked if we wanted anything else instead. We said no, we would be eating something else that night.  Mind you, im sure everyone thinks they are being polite, but we actually were. We arent very confrontational people, and were acting very understanding even though the problem definitely warranted us to maybe stick up for ourselves a little more. The manager took several minutes to bring us back our refund receipt. When he finally did, I noticed that this man had the audacity to not fully reund the entire order. He walked away before I could say anything.

Guys, if I come to your restaurant, pay for some stuff you don't have, and you dont tell me you wont be giving it to me until I ask 30 mins later, throw me a freaking bone. Do not make me pay for the side salad. I did not come to portillo's for a salad. I came for a ravioli, and waited much longer than I should have had to. Very poor customer service decision there, and it lost you two regulars.",0
873,"I HAD TO TAKE A MINUTE  & WRITE A REVIEW ABOUT THIS LOCATION... my mama and I came in at the last few moments of opening hours and from the woman taking our order ...to the sweet young lady beside her waiting to clock out ...to the woman wiping tables down with a smile on her face ...to the sweetness and extremely nice kitchen folk and manager still allowing us to eat the absolutely amazing chicken sandwiches and fries that we ate inside ... It was absolutely the best experience I have ever experienced in general at a restaurant especially... no doubt! they had home on their weary minds and yet they were absolutely perfect! You go go go the Portillo's crew, y'all know how to run & rock a Portillo's!
Psss... Mr. Dick ought to be proud of ya'll

-Jeremy Abbott- & My Sweet Mama, Mary Abbott!",1
874,"Portillo's is always a 5 - never had a bad meal there, they are flawless. It is one of the most under rated Italian beefs in the city....I'd give Al's Beef the title for that and Portillo's second. The chocolate eclair cake is unbelievable.  Great chicken chopped salad, with or without the cheese.",1
875,Portillos Cheese Fries. Crispy crinkle cut fries. Right as you stick your hand in the bag you can feel the steamy heat as the humidity created by the fries not only makes your mouth water but makes your fingers salivate as well. You grab an unprecedented amount because you’ve been craving them for months. The salt attaches to your fingers like Velcro. As you move the fries towards the hot-liquid golden cheese your nose catches a whiff and brings back memories of when you were a kid and would eat there with friends. Nostalgia ensues as you take the first dip of the salty crisped rigid potatoes into the well of heaven that is the cheese. You break a sweat in anticipation and imagining how rich it will taste. You pull the golden potatoes out of the liquid concoction and give a courtesy 2 shakes so some excess cheese subtly drips from the tip of the fries back into a melted cheese well. You pull the dipped and hot fries from the pond of dairy and towards your mouth. Your pupils dilate. It’s finally here. The fries enter your mouth. Teeth and tongues make contact at the same time as you bite and hear the crunch you’ve been longing for. Your eyes orgasmically roll back into your head. You’ve just cum. Your pants are now soaked and need to change. Portillos cheese fries.,1
876,"Long long long lines. Sorry 3 stars, not planning to come back. Hot dogs were meh I can get better hotdogs literally anywhere.",1
877,Everyone loves a beef sandwhich or a Chicago hot dog so this is the place to go! Their cake shake is also decent but you should fill up on the food not the desserts.,1
878,"OVERALL SERVICE UNSATISFACTORY-This place has lost its friendliness and family values.  Service was extremely slow despite that fact that I called in my order; my food was room temperature/nearly cold. This used to be one of the top places to bring my family when we visit home.  I will no longer be returning TO PORTILLO'S on CLARK & ONTARIO in Chicago, IL.",0
879,I can always go for some portillo's burger. That's like number one. As basic as it sound the meat is nicely cooked do r have to pay a whole lot of money for nice meat. And the pickles are thick and crunchy. There cake are a must! Now the only thing that makes me tale a step back is their pasta. Some of them can be greasy.  I could even finish my chicken alfredo. Aside from that all is good.,1
880,"The Portillo's hot dog is excellent, very tasty and super cheap. The Italian Beef sandwich is delicious, very tasty and juicy meet. The bar is a character in itself, with tokens from the city hanging out in the walls.",1
881,I literally can’t tell the difference between Portillo’s Hot Dogs and others... it’s not bad but nothing special besides its restaurant decoration. The old-school decoration and design is interesting.,1
882,"Great place to get classic Chicago Staples, an Italian beef or Chicago dog. This place can get quite busy so expect to wait a bit. There are two sides to the place once you enter. The side with the dogs, burgers, and Italian beef / other sandwichs is Portillo's. The side with the pastas and salads is Barnelli's. Each had their own lines",1
883,Well what can I say this is Chicago's go to spot! Everything from the beef the cheeseburgers to my favorite chocolate cake in the whole wide world pure perfection! Asked for french fries when your grabbing your order! Everything is great at Portillo's,1
884,"Food is subpar. It is no longer about quality, but moving people through in herds. They used to have great dogs and beefs that represented Chicago. Unfortunately that was not our experience this time. Just a lot of loud squaking of numbers through bull horns over a hungry mass of tourists waiting to eat dry Italian beefs.",0
885,"Let me condition this review because I don't intend to discourage anyone from visiting Portillo's, my only hope (and it's ambitious) is that someone internal to Portillo's will read it and utilize it as a teachable moment for the staff.

Ok, with that said, this was my experience: I ordered food for myself, my mom, and my son at 9:30 pm on Monday night (5/28). Even at that hour, the place was packed, but we moved through the line very quickly. I ordered all the things that were suggested we try. The hot dog and the lemon cake were at the top of that list. Then everything fell completely apart.

The counter where you pick up your food is a DISASTER. The young lady behind the counter refused to use the speaker phone because ""it made her voice sound funny."" So, to hear your order number you HAD to stand at the counter instead of sitting at a table. Several minutes went by and we got nothing. Finally, at 9:45 pm (remember, we ordered hot dogs and slice of cake that was pre-made), I asked the lady at the counter if she had a status update on our food. She said ""It's being cooked fresh."" Ok, so I'll allow a few more minutes. Then I see someone who ordered their food 12 minutes after mine, get their order. That's when I decided to visit the cashier to see if she could please check on our order. What a mistake that was.

For reference, there was no one ordering at the cashier, so I was not inconveniencing anyone in line. I politely asked the cashier if she could please check on our order at 9:55 pm (we are now 25 minutes in on some hot dogs). Not as expected, she gave me TONS of attitude. It took my begging and pleading, and asking her to please check for my 4-year-old son who was hungry. She finally agreed to go look for our food. At 10:05 pm, she returns with our food, but not all of it. She then accuses me of lying because she says the bag had been there the whole time, and that I should have just asked someone at the pick-up counter. I did. And for that matter, if it WAS sitting there the whole time, why did it take 10 minutes for the cashier to locate that bag of food? An unsolved mystery.

Here's what I gathered from this scenario. Do not take young children in here, it is not family friendly. The staff is rude and inconsiderate. Yes, the lemon cake is good, but its JUST hot dogs. And, finally, if you have to wait as long as we did, your hot dog will be cold and soggy thereby ruining the charm and appeal of even going here in the first place.

Thank you for reading.",0
886,"One of the best there is. This is where I get my Chicago dog. Just simple and they come correct every time. They also have a decent Italian beef, not the best in town but very good.",1
887,"Another unique Chicago experience. As long as you go in knowing it's going to be busy (especially this location), then you should expect an enjoyable experience. It's like chik-fil-a drive thru, the line almost turns you away, but everything actually moves very fast.",1
888,I placed an order online waited 26 minutes in drive thru. Food was cold. Asked if I could get hot onion rings all they did was drop back in oil which almost burnt them. Very disappointing. Never going back to this one again 🤬,0
889,"Can't go wrong at a Portillos.  Great food.  A bit busy but it's a busy location.
They could hire another person or maybe use a person there to maintain the trash cans a bit closer.  They were overflowing when we went.  Parking anywhere near here stinks so it would be great if they had a validation option for parking nearby.",1
890,"Foods pretty good, lines are long though, and the staff was less than pleasant. Which is kind of understandable after hearing how some of the other patrons were treating them. All that said, it's worth a visit if in the area for sure.",1
891,Fantastic Chicago hot dog add Italian beef! You sjmoser have to check out the delicious frozen custard (ice cream). The atmosphere is fun and it's a great place to take the kids.,1
892,"Food is great, but no one knows where to send people for call ins, online orders, or meal pals...not sure why all aren't in the most obvious spot: pickup area. And there's no ""hurry"" in these spots. I ordered ahead to save time...I might as well have stayed in line",1
893,"Food is good but wait in drive thru is terrible. Had large order for family. Made us wait at gas station next door. When we got home, part of the order (cheeseburger) was missing. Too frustrated to go back. Hope they enjoyed the cheeseburger.",0
894,Italian beef was so good.  The fries are nice and the chocolate cake was a winner.,1
895,If you don't go to Portillo's when on a trip to Chicago then did you really even go to Chicago. Italian Beef is as much  Chicago staple as a Chicago Dog which you can also get at Portillo's. My order today like usual was a Italian Beef (dipped) lt was just as good as it always is.,1
896,Very delicious food 👍🏾,1
897,Portillo's is great as always. Lots of really good menu options to choose from. I'd always recommend a beef sandwich or a hotdog with everything on it. Make sure to top it off with a chocolate cake shake every now and then!,1
898,Best Italian beef sandwich ever. It was $11 to park right across the street. Worth every penny for that sandwich.,1
899,"Had the dipped italian beef, fries, and a shake. Was great all around! Service was fast, tons of options as well.",1
900,Food was ok as expected.  The polish dog was much preferable to the regular hot dog.  Order pickup is a bit of a cluster but I guess that part of the allure.,1
901,The food was great but the service was TERRIBLE. The cashiers rushed us as soon as we stepped up to order. When my gf came behind me to order drinks the cashier sucked her teeth and sighed heavily. What is the problem lady? That's ridiculous. The cashier next to us gave the same bad service to another friend. So it's just their TERRIBLE service overall.,1
902,"WOW!!!! Portillo’s is a Chicagoland Must in deed! Great variety choices of food. Salads, deserts, sandwiches, pasta’s and even burgers. I totally recommend this place. Miss it a whole lot. Can’t wait to come back once again soon!",1
903,Good hot dogs and sausages. A good tourist place to experience Chicago food.,1
904,"I am a picky person and was often told that i am hard to be pleased, but i have to say this restaurant offers the best double cheese burger and ribs i've tried within the US. The burger patties have a nice smoky crust on the outside and is tender and juicy inside. The burger sauce and other ingredients (tomatoes and onions etc) all go well with the burger. Pickles inside are not too sour yet add a nice balance to the flavor. I like how they put inside small pieces of onions instead of a whole ring, that way the onions blend better with the rest ingredients and are easier to be bitten off in my opinion.

The rib is smoked to the right degree, and most importantly not too soft or soggy because of overuse of sauce or overcooking/overly marinading. I guess this is because they are willing to do some work to finalize the ribs after you order instead of serving already prepared ones to save time. So be prepared to wait for around 10 min after you order but i think it's worth it!

Their Italian beef sandwich is also very good, juicy and flavorful, which is actually the reason that brought me to the restaurant the first place. Remember to add peppers, otherwise the sandwich will be bland.

Also, i like the way they do business. Basically the place is operating like a fast food restaurant where you order at the counter and get your own food by yourself. Therefore, i dont need to deal with the out of control american tipping culture there. Yet they have nice restaurant tables you can sit in and the staffs would clean up for you once you finish the meals.

Things i dont like--- when i ordered the Italian beef and burger, i had to pay extra money to get the essential ingredients (for example, peppers or cheese). Although that money was definitely not a lot, i still feel like the price should include everything essential, even if that means they need to increase the price a little, which i think it's a better price strategy for the store, since those delicious items would be much less impressive if missing the extra price ingredients and thus some people would not have the chance to have the real good experience if they choose not to pay extra.",1
905,"Very fast service and good food as always. I recommend avoiding rush hour. It is a clean facility and good all around environment for quick food. If you are in the area, can't miss Portillos! I will definitely be back here",1
906,"This is hard to do.... give a low rating to Portillo's but it has to be done.  We LOVE Portillo's, but we attended a private event in the upstairs area and their catering was really substandard.  The employees were very nice, but the level of service was substandard... they were slow about refilling drinks, food, etc.  Running out of food at a catered event onsite is just not acceptable.",0
907,Amazing food loved it the beef sandwich dipped is a must when you go there,1
908,This place never disappoints!!! Amazing beef sandwiches,1
909,"Came on a busy night, waited a considerable amount of time but service was on point and kept the traffic flowing. After sitting down and finally getting to ingest this city-famous hot dog I will say it delivered, and had me wishing I had gotten a whole damn hot dog by myself since I just shared the half of one (me trying to diet ass). I then proceeded to come for the cheese fries and will swear on my life that cheese fries are frikkin everything and if you do not order them you can just leave. That's all I have to say lol.",1
910,Had the chili and cheese dog as well as the combo Italian sausage and beef sandwich.  Great food.  Long line that moves fast.  They could work on how the orders go out,1
911,"Well, it all looked good and service was very attentive, but it's really not geared for vegetarians. My Greek salad had surprise chicken. Probably a plus for most people.",1
912,Best chili cheese dog I've ever had.  Staff was sweet and friendly!,1
913,"I’m gobsmacked at the positive reviews of this establishment.  It appears to be a quintessential tourist trap and I can’t see many natives wasting their time waiting on line to order and then wait again to receive the food.

The entire process appears like utter chaos.  There are no clear signs posted anywhere on what to do or where to go.  The whole thing could be streamlined and made more understandable with boards explaining the entire process.

In this day and age to have people shouting out your number seems utterly anachronistic.  You could just as easily have displays that state which orders are being processed and what orders are ready for pickup.

To have to wait in chaos only to revive a mediocre wiener with salad on top is not my idea of a enjoyable dinning experience.

In protest I will begin to carry my own ketchup packets to put on every subsequent Chicago hot dog I eat.",0
914,Amazing dogs and Italian beef. Will be back anytime I’m in Chicago,1
915,Best hot dogs in Chicago! Loved this place. I highly recommend you come and give them a chance. You won't regret it. Try their traditional.,1
916,"My favorite Portillos.  Though I will admit it can be confusing inside with all of the different registers and windows.  Just look for the other people waiting for their orders, and you'll know where to go.  Very fast, and you can't go wrong with either the dogs or the beef.  This location is handy because it's near the downtown attractions and a short walk from the Grand metro exit on State Street.",1
917,"Used to be a 5 star joint. Last several times I've not been impressed. Barely any beef on my sandwich- used to be a nice serving, seems like they've gotten stingy.",1
918,"Fantastic Chicago style hotdogs. I’ve been eating these hotdogs for years. I could easily eat a dozen but, I don’t because I want to stay in shape. It’s very difficult to stop after eating two. Messy but wonderful.",1
919,The best hot dogs I didn't buy enough should've took 2 next time 3,1
920,"Im not sure if this is just the location; But the costumer service was terrible. As i know how tedious it can be to be a cashier and cook , sure , yet  my experience shouldnt have been dealt how it was. The cashier was fast,a little too fast due to the fact she didnt listen to my order and called out ""next"" before i could change my drink order & even when i went back she never changed it to what i wanted. They got my order wrong which it was just simple no biggie , i was just missing cheese for my cheese fries but it was like pulling teeth for them to be attentive as there were workers standing around. The lady told me to go pay for the cheese instead of handing it to me like she did the lady before (she had the same issue). I understand it was due to closing maybe, everyone was tired , done with the night But Portillos has such a High name , why not own up to it? The burgers were amazing tho!",0
921,Omg...why haven't I visited here sooner. Went during an extremely busy time. Lines were out the door. Food was great. Shakes were awesome. My family and I will be back or at least visit the one in the Indianapolis area.,1
922,"Was disappointed there was No lemon cake no chocolate and they charge $2 extra for a crossaint sandwich!!! But despite my pouting, enjoyed my meal.",1
923,"Portillo's is a Chicago staple. You can't come downtown without experiencing it. Whether you want something simple like a hot dog and cheese fries, a hearty salad or their signature Italian beef and/or cheeseburgers--it will not disappoint. Quite efficient getting through the crowds. There's never a time it's not busy.",1
924,Delicious hot dogs and ribs,1
925,"The food here is very good no doubt about that but it is very hectic at times. The place is very loud and lines can be out the door which can turn out to be a 20 minute line just to order. When my family and I went we were stuck in a crazy long line just to order and to get our food was another 50 minutes. The place is very crowded at times and it can be extremely hard just to find seating. Decent food, just kind of crazy.",1
926,"First things first, the Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers was to die for. Don't think twice, let them use the standard amount of Au Jus. Is it going to be messy? Yes. Are you going to need extra napkins? Absolutely! Is little Jimmy going to spill it all over himself? Oh yea! Just let this sandwich blow your mind. The milkshakes are also on point, but don't hold a candle to the Italian beef. The reason I can't give Portillo's 5 stars? The food pickup method they use is horrible. I was here on a weekday night, it was pretty busy, and I was in a mass of unorganized people waiting for the overwhelmed girls behind the counter to announce numbers as fast as they could. It took a hot minute to get the food sorted out, and even longer for the drinks. Don't let that put you off though! I'll be dreaming of that Italian beef the entire flight home.",1
927,"i hate to even set time aside in my day to write a review but I feel as if this is justified. I was in the drive thru at 9pm on Thursday October 18th. The line was pretty empty (surprisingly) and I was able to pull all the way up to the first drive thru window. Typically there is a cashier waiting to take the order. This was not the case. Cars began to pile up behind me. There was probably about 7 cars behind me when a cashier finally came out. The cashier accidentally skipped me not knowing my order had not been taken. I made my way all the way up to the 2nd drive thru window where the food is handed out to the food runner. My order was still not taken. I informed the food runner the cashier has accidentally skipped me. Mind you everyone behind me had their order taken and was actually getting there food. I spent 35 minutes in the line before my order was even taken. I would have never waited in line if my girlfriend didn’t request I get her food. I informed the manager Josh of the situation and he didn’t seem to care at all, he said that everyone had been waiting behind me even though I waited 35 minutes. I worked at portillo’s for 1 year at the oak lawn location back in 2010-2011, never in my life had I had a manager treat their customer the way josh treated me. I know what’s expected of portillo’s managers. Josh is not a leader, he’s a boss. Talks down upon his employees. Absolutely ridiculous.",0
928,Did not disappoint born and raised in rural Illinois had to get me a classic chicago dog family had a blast Vacation from Wichita Kansas,1
929,Good food. Good prices. Didn't even have to leave my car. My date was not impressed. Called me cheap and disrespectful just because it was only our second date. Just can't please some women these days.,1
930,"Food was ok, ribs were great as well as the chocolate cake shake. Do not get the breaded chicken sandwich its not good at all. Most the staff is nice, but there is a few rude employees. Manager is nice.",1
931,"LOVE Portillos! I never get a salad....Cant resist the gut bomb polish sausages and burgers. So tasty, but you'll gain 5 pounds! LOL Cornerstone to the Chicago land area now, you gotta have it!",1
932,"I love everything about this place! The food, the friendly service, and the reasonable prices. I always avoid the busy times because it does get pretty chaotic in there, but it is one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago!",1
933,Great food and atmosphere!,1
934,Not too expensive. Good fries. Probably a good place to grab a casual dinner with a sizeable group of friends or family. Not a place for business dinners tho unless it's just a lunch with close coworkers.,1
935,"Delicious food, but come on. Half of the time they miss an item for my order. Happened tonight, so I called in to speak to a manager. Manager put me on hold, and I stayed there lmao. I'll call again tomorrow and get my money back. Make sure to check your bag before you leave!",1
936,Great place to grab a quick bite - hot dog was great and full of flavor. Staff are friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend for a great Chicago-style hot dog.,1
937,Very good hotdogs. It had a nice bite to it.,1
938,"Ordering from this Portillo's was an awful experience unfortunately. I was charged for my items but upon delivery, about 1/3 were missing. The delivery boy was outsourced and not an employee of Portillos so he was unable to remedy the situation. He confirmed that everything from my order was given to me.

When I reached out to Portillos online, a manager sent me an email apologizing and asking for an address to send a coupon. Not only did a coupon never arrive, but the manager has not responded to any follow ups I have sent. (2 followup emails about 2 weeks apart).

Poor packaging (which it was), late delivery (which it was), and a terrible ordering process (which  it was) are all things I can put up with.

But paying for food that was not delivered and not getting a refund is THEFT. Extremely disappointed here and so were my guests that did not get to eat that day.",0
939,"Get in line to enjoy the food. This very popular Portillo's with a roaring 20s theme serves quality Chicago fast food: Italian beef, Italian sausage, hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken sandwiches, salads and Italian pastas. Everything is sold separately.  So maybe skip the usual fries and Coke because, in the back left corner, they serve wine and beer at reasonable prices ... and, finally, to die for, is the absolutely delicious fudge frosting chocolate cake!  OMG!  People line up just to buy the chocolate cake on Valentine's day, when it comes in the heart-shaped red foil pan.  For many out- of- town-ers, Portillo's is actually a destination restaurant  Come in and enjoy.",1
940,"I think it might be a chain, but the one on Clark has got to be the mothership. It's extremely kitschy inside, set up like a food court with a fake red brick facade where the ordering windows are. It's a great spot for a quality classic Chicago dog. They  take some getting used to, but I'm now a fan of the fresh ingredients and the neon green Chicago relish. Even with a long line you can have your food in about fifteen minutes from walking in. They do much more than dogs, too--burgers pizza, panini, pastas, and various other things. Oh, and frozen custard. There's lots of seating on 2 levels. There are also clean bathrooms.

And it's a much more worthwhile fast food experience than the rock and roll McDonald's across the street.",1
941,"Garbage customer service from the manager. I called regarding a refund that never processed. and without asking my name, order number, the date I ordered, etc she told me they had no “recollection” of any transaction. She was very rude and unprofessional and I’m not sure how she could confidently discuss an order when she hadn’t done the bare minimum to locate said order. I enjoy portillos, but I’m very disappointed by this experience.",0
942,"I honestly got really bad treatment from the cashier, dirty toilets, no ketchup, would never go back again, or recommend to friends",0
943,Amazing place for Italian beef sandwiches and shakes.,1
944,"Super good food, fast service, busy, cute interior! I had the Italian beef.",1
945,"A Chicago staple! Tasty dogs & fries, and super cheap! Yes, they serve alcohol (and at a reasonable price). Cool vibe all around. Definitely worth checking out.",1
946,"Portillos is second to none for authentic Chicago fare but the service and experience have really gone by the way side.  If you head to the river north location, be prepared to wait in long lines, get a lot of attitude from the staff and clean your own table before dining.  Take out is the way to go but give them 30 minutes longer then they put on the invoice re service is a major issue. Nevermind, give them 45 minutes longer than they say on the pick up. Their pick up process is the most incompetent program in the land.",0
947,"-Best burger in town.Yeah i said it!
I don't know about you but i have never tasted a better burger than the one at Portillos.

Almost every-time i go out of town and 3/4 of the places i go to eat i usually get a burger of some kind. Still have never had better meat than Portillos. Now i get allot of static about this comment and i still must stick to my guns on this.

I cant say the same for the beefs and hot-dogs although those are arguably the best they have to offer outside of the Chocolate cake.Hots dogs and beef are not bad and the cake is really good but Burger wins in my opinion!",1
948,"Great food, great atmosphere, overall an excellent family restaurant. It can be intimidating if it's your first time, but as long as they aren't trying to serve 100+ people they'll help you out.
Try the cake shake!",1
949,"Rude service and substandard food. The cake tasted like canned frosting, not homemade. Beef sandwich was tasteless, I threw it away. Go to Chicago Dog House instead for a delicious hot dog.",0
950,"Saturday night drive through, waited over 40 min and our order was still wrong. Fries were getting cold by the time we got them. This is the first and only time I've been disappointed by any Portillo's location.",0
951,"Can't tell if it's good or not. hot dogs are all the same!!!
Well, this is more salty to be compared.",1
952,"Is a review even necessary for this place? Quintessential Chicago hot dog chain... although I come for the cheese fries. Uh oh, now my mouth is watering. Chopped salad, Cheese fries, and a large root beer. I don't know what it is about Portillo's that makes me want to drink the stuff - I don't do it anywhere else. The drive through is a bit difficult to navigate if you're not familiar with the area, but they move quickly and have never messed up my order! Can't speak to the inside, cuz America - I only drive through and take it to go.",1
953,"Had the beef sausage combo sandwich. Both parts of it were delicious! The atmosphere is fun, full of strange/funny things to look at. It is full, busy, and very noisy.",1
954,Inside the amazing selection of food choices can be overwhelming. I enjoyed the classic chicago favorites at the counter for hot dogs and more. I also enjoyed a strawberry shake and the service was very fast.,1
955,Definitely worth visiting at least once as a Chicago landmark.Both the hotdog & the beef sandwich were good but not exceptional. They seemed to be having  issues with the  staff which translated into some rudeness & incorrect orders.,1
956,My first time being able to enjoy this icon hotdog and all I can say is that I wish there was a place where I lived. The atmosphere was wonderful and the staff very helpful. The food was probably the best hotdog I've had to date.,1
957,"I make sure that when I'm in Chicago, I stay in a hotel around Portillo's because it's that good.  Now, it IS a chain, it IS decorated to be super touristy, and I wouldn't try to pass this off as the best food in Chicago, there are plenty of other fine dining options that surpasses them.  What Portillo's brings to the table is a down to earth sandwich/hot dog that's as iconic as the Hancock building or the Sears/Willis tower.  Every city has ""their"" hot dog.  Seattle adds cream cheese and grilled onions, New York keeps it nice and simple, but Chicago dogs are by far my favorite with their hot peppers.

However for an even better time, nothing beats their Italian beef served with sweet or hot peppers, and if you like, served with cheese and/or their au jus (personal favorite: Italian beef, hot peppers, dipped).  If you're feeling extra hungry, go for either their Big Beef or Italian beef & sausage, you really can't go wrong.  Just know that whatever you get, it's a mess to eat, but it's just as much fun licking your fingers after.  I was in Chicago for a long weekend and ended up going back 3 times...not because there isn't other great food options in Chicago, but when I'm in the mood for a meal more for the common man, Portillo's is sure to hit the spot.",1
958,Loved the Chicago Beef Dog and chocolate cake. The lines are long but move quickly. The menu has so many more things I want to try!,1
959,"complete chaos . My friend and I went for a hot dog and a sandwich, and we waited and we waited. After 30 minutes, my friend asked  when his sandwich could be expected. No one knew. Then he asked for a refund, and the cashier reluctantly told a supervisor. The supervisor then expedited his order, so that he finally got his (mediocre) sandwich.

There was nothing special about the food, and with the utter chaos in the kitchen, I cannot possibly recommend this place.",0
960,"I don't get the whole love of Portillos. The food is OK, slightly better than other fast food chains. This location is super busy but they do a good job of getting you in and out the drive-thru quickly.",1
961,"When your DT you know its going to be traffic, but for an Italian beef I CAN WAIT! Its so bomb I love it",1
962,"Effin terrible! I usually have a great experience but tonight was the worst. Terrible customer service, botched order, all bad. Why hire people that have no customer service skills, cant greet or smile and dont even CONFIRM THE ORDER in the drive thru. So of course when I got my food I had to pull to the last window to receive my missed items. Only to come back to my hotel and realize they screwed mt sandwich up. Thumbs down for the Portillos in Ontario!",0
963,"OMG, their food was so damn delicious. My family and I enjoyed this spot, have to come down and try this food!!!",1
964,"My order was not properly prepared.  My order was simple.. an reg. Italian Beef w/ Sweet Peppers & Giardiniera Peppers, Cheddar Cheese and extra dipped.  The sandwich alone was over $8.00. I was staying at The Godfrey Hotel and when I reached my room and was ready to eat, I was in Awe. #1. No Cheddar Cheese.
#2. Wasn't Dipped. #3 No Sweet Peppers. I ate possibly a sixth of the sandwich and threw the remaining away. Wasn't up to walking back, nor did I call over an $8.00 + bill. I chalked it up as lesson learned.",0
965,"Great Hot Dogs and Italian Beef sandwiches! Too gimmicky for it's own good, which really slows down service. If the service was better it would be a definite go to all the time.",1
966,"Classic Chicago establishment with all of your burger, hot dog, and pasta needs. This location does get very busy at lunch time during the week so come early or order online.",1
967,Hot dogs taste good but most do. The Italian beef sandwich is good but the portion is way to small for the price. Drive through good but don't be in a hurry .,1
968,I was visiting Chicago by myself from Denver. I was told by friends I absolutely had to go to Portillo's. So I visited. The service is efficient and the food was just amazing! I'll be back next time I'm in Chicago!,1
969,"Nice place, but not the best food I've tasted in Chicago.",1
970,"This review is for Portillo's own online ordering,which was simple to use but chaos at actual pick up. If you must fix the portillo's itch, suck it up and bet on ordering in person. The to-go lines are a disaster between all the third party delivery pick ups and their own.",0
971,The combo beef and sausage tasted really good!,1
972,Excellent food and a really cool restaurant. Going there is definitely an experience. It’s organized chaos ordering and getting food but it’s absolutely worth the wait even when it’s busy. Highly recommend for anyone visiting the city.,1
973,Loved it. Great mega diner atmosphere.,1
974,Great food and a great price.,1
975,Amazing cheap vegan dog,1
976,Their food is always great and their services usually aces too. Their spicy chicken sandwich can't hold a candle to Popeyes though 😋,1
977,Long wait to pick up food and then learned that non-food orders sometimes required asking for the order separately. Then another 5 to 10 minutes for the order to be fulfilled ... someone was being trained to make a certain flavor drink.,0
978,"A trip back in time, with a well recreated atmosphere of the 1930s. The food is quite common, but the looks of the place is not. Music is well chosen to send you back in time, as well as the decorations. Worth a visit!",1
979,Too busy to take care of customers,1
980,It was very good . I have had the chocolate cake shake there and it was pretty delicious .,1
981,"Definitely a must do when in Chicago. Cheap tasty food. Get the ""Combo"" which is a sausage dog topped in beef. Chili dog is also bomb. Both kinda messy but delicious!",1
982,"Portillo's is known for their hot dogs, burgers, and amazing milk shakes--which is all true. But one of my favorite things that I have to mention on the menu that never gets a lot of reviews is the HOT CHICKEN CEASAR salad. It's amazing, and everyone should try it out.",1
983,I love it I get my beef super wet I mean dripping wet I mean wet really wet ..delicious. five stars all the way  son and  cheese fries for an appetizer and if I'm feeling frisky a piece of chocolate cake.,1
984,Great place for dogs! The Portillo's Hot Dog was the first time I've ever tried a Chicago dog & loved it. Maxwell's Street Polish was also pretty great & flavorful.,1
985,"If you're visiting Chicago this place should be on your list.  Food is good, service is friendly and efficient.   I didn't see  a parking lot, we used public transit to get there.  Even though it was very busy there was still plenty of seating.",1
986,Food speak for itself. Super delicious! Great service. You can’t come to Chicago and not eat at Portillo’s.,1
987,Absolutely in love with there hotdogs. My family and I traveled all the way from NJ to try there hotdogs and cake shake. Best best best I had!!!!,1
988,Iconic place to eat while visiting Chicago.,1
989,"Lived up to expectations and beyond.   Italian beef and Chicago hotdogs both were delish,  great service and 50s diner atmosphere with lots of Chicago memorabilia.",1
990,"Fast, friendly service. Exelent dogs, sausages, and Italian beef. Great fries. You cannot go wrong eating at portillo's.  Just don't park in Walgreens parking lot. They WILL tow you. Towed me before I even had my food. $218.00 later. You have been warned.",1
991,"Portillo's food is just good,, but this review cant say to much cuz i went thru the drive thru in the morning after grocery shopping downtown Chgo. So the drive way very narrow but there were cones so maybe they open up during busier hours. The worker outside was very friendly and service was quick.",1
992,"I had been to Portillos once before and was staying at a hotel nearby, so was happy to have the opportunity to grab a bite of dinner there.  I arrived just before the dinner crowd and placed my order.  The crowd arrived almost immediately after I ordered.  Since I knew they were extremely busy, I waited patiently for my number to be called, but after 20 minutes, I walked up to the girl calling the numbers and handing out food and asked about my order.  She walked around to check on it, then went back to calling out numbers and handing out food, but didn't say a word to me.  I tried getting her attention, but she ignored me. I waited another 5 minutes and said HEY, really loud to get her attention.  When she looked at me I asked what she found out about my order.  She said she didn't know where it was and couldn't leave her post.  Wow, really helpful.  For a minute, I thought maybe I was on Candid Camera, or something.  After wiping the dumbfounded look off my face, I asked if there was someone that could help me, at which point she turned around and tapped another employee on the shoulder.  When he turned around, she just pointed at me.  Really?  I explained my situation again.  After another 10 minutes, I finally got my order.  Unfortunately, I wasn't really all that enthusiastic about eating Portillos by the time I got my food.  I ordered chicken tenders and fries.  They were decent, but not worth the wait.",0
993,Busy place but very streamlined service. The hot dogs and italian beef are really good.  The chocolate cake shake was delicious.,1
994,"Iconic restaurant, high traffic location. Great food, whether you are looking for the well known Italian beef (get it dipped and with shredded cheese) or Chicago dog, or a chopped salad. A local favorite.",1
995,Dream came true with chocolate cake shake,1
996,You have to visit. Amazing food fast service even under all the chaos of people. Have never Ben so impressed with service in my life. I for one give all the employees a 👍.the pressure you all work under and still flawless.,1
997,One of( imho )the many places to visit for good food if you are vacationing or been here(living under a rock)😄 give them a try.,1
998,The Maxwell Polish is delicious.,1
999,"If you want a simple affordable meal head to Portillo's They serve up great hot dogs, burgers, other sandwiches, salads, shakes, fries, of course, and more. And what's so great is that it's like 2 restaurants in one so if you'e with the family or a group and some folks are craving burgers, dogs, and fries but others want a healthier or more substantial option this is the prefect spot. I absolutely LOVE their chopped salad. It has been a favorite of mine for years and years.",1
1000,"Went there with a friend first the first time. It was a good hot dog. Maybe not the best dog I've ever had, but the restaurant had a great atmosphere and you could feel the energy of the city.",1
1001,Always great when we're in Chicago. Be sure to grab a piece of chocolate cake!,1
1002,"This place came highly recommended for local hot dogs.  Had a vibrant atmosphere and the place was packed and rowdy.  The hot dog itself was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had.  I will be trying other spots.",1
1003,"I went to Chicago on a business trip, where a colleague recommended we have a hot dog or sandwich at Portillo's. We had lunch there, leaving me with a mixed review. It was definitely different from standard fast food chains in many respects, but I still came away with the heavy feeling of having eaten a very heavy, greasy meal. A word of warning, when they say ""gravy"" that does not mean the thick, brown gravy you see on roast beef and mashed potatoes (the association I made, since I was ordering a beef sandwich). Instead, my sandwich was dipped in ""au jus"" (why couldn't they just call it that?). It tasted OK, but was a mess to eat.",1
1004,Everything it should have been for a Chicago Hot Dog at Breakfast.,1
1005,"Ordered several times from the with one simple request: make my burgers without just beef and cheese, nothing else. No onions, no lettuce, no tomatoes, and no sauces. Four times, the food arrived over an hour later than predicted on GrubHub, and always incorrect. Like how hard is it to *NOT* add things to a burger?",0
1006,"Ordered from here on Postmates. How do you mess up an order this bad?

The entire order was wrong. Both beef sandwiches were missing their gravy (the point of the sandwiches), and the beef combo was missing the sausage (the item that makes it a combo), the cheese fries were missing the cheese and the fries were cold, and the burger was missing the the tomato (which it was ordered with) and had lettuce (which it was not ordered with) AND it took an hour and a half. Also the onion rings were a pathetic quantity.",0
1007,The best place to eat when in Chicago. I always have to stop here at least once when I'm in town. So much to chose from. I always try something different. But...always get a chili dog. They have the best ever.,1
1008,"For tourist, if you want to eat some Chicago style fast food, this is the place, form a hot dog to a italian beef sandwich, everything is done with care and made to order fresh. With my cholesterol and hypertension I cannot afford to eat here too often, but when I want to treat myself with good cheap eats, this is the place I go.",1
1009,"Hot dogs are good, but small. It's a bit in the insane side. If you're going, order ahead and pick up, avoid the craziness of the food auction that happens at the pickup counter",1
1010,"Yes, yes, and yes! If you're in the mood for some genuine Chicago style hot dogs, this place is a must stop. You walk into the doors and it immediately feels like you stepped back in time. The Jumbo Chili dogs are to die for! They accidently charged us for an extra and didn't know it until we sat down. Needless to say, I didn't care after I took my first bite. Another thing to notice is all the signed celebrity pictures hanging around the place. Love this place!",1
1011,Was very slow brought 6 jumbled up bags called out names did not put any sauce or sides I ordered. Not organized and customer service was not the best,0

1013,"Place was packed! At 3pm! Very good dog (Jumbo with Everything), though I must admit of all the Chicago foodstuffs I experienced, the dog was my least favorite. ... Except maybe the Malort.",1
1014,Great location. Walk distance from nearby downtown locations. This place gets busy during lunch hours. Always double check your order before leaving. Sometimes they can forget due to the high level of customers,1
1015,"Whenever I go I enjoy their chocolate cake shake. It's but so is all their food. Be warned, it's not healthy food. Just good food. Also it constantly is packed especially on weekends and around lunch or dinnertime.",1
1016,"We ate here three times on our first stay in Chicago. We first had the hot dogs. Amazing! Then ribs! Amazing as well. Our second visit we had italian sausage, hot dog, and pasta. Was amazing! Third visit we had the italian beef and cheese burger. Amazing as well! Every visit were never disappointed! Great tasting food and great price! Parking costs more than both our meals at Portillos! Definitely highly recommended! Will be back again! Thanks Portillos and keep it up!",1
1017,"These reviews are crazy. The food is good fast food, I'll give them that but it's definitely not worth the terrible service. The whole process is a nightmare and the staff couldn't care less about serving customers. I would not recommend eating here. Even the mobile ordering system is terrible.",0
1018,"A group of us were visiting Chicago, we came here for the first time. My cousin and I ate the first hot dog and got back in the line for a second, so freaking good! I will be back!🤤👌🏽",1

1026,It was good to go back to my first portillo's experience. The food is great. Everything on the menu❤️it!!! The only problem parking and the drive thru.,1
1027,Food was ok wasn't how expected nice customer service,1
1028,Pick up counter can be a little forgetful. But the food here is awesome. One of the best coleslaws I've ever had. And definitely try a cake shake!,1
1029,"My first experience of portillos on recommendation of a friend. Would suggest everyone try the Italian beef sandwich, very very tender beef cooked in gravy, for the volume of people it was fast services.
The cake really is as good as it's reputation.",1
1030,I waited outside for about 20 minutes and there walgreens crossed the street as I got in it was packed only one line there paper menu which isn't much on there you eat inside or on go All I said was it was slowly I wish more restaurants open earlier like this. 5 star 🌟,1
1031,"The drive-thru is a well oiled machine- they have it down to a science! Italian beef is always a solid choice.... literally I’ve had over a dozen from this location, always legit. Ahhhh- delicious!",1
1032,"Food is as good as always. The only major downside is the service: it's stressful af. I've been screamed at less at The Weiner Circle and they suck. Tell the screamer at the pick up area not to treat everyone like they're at the TSA line. I'm not a child kicking and screaming at an amusement park. But again, the food is great :)",0
1033,"Come for the hot dogs and to cross it off your Chicago bucket list. This is the quintessential Chicago touristy food spot there is.  Food is unmemorable. A very interesting layout, always super packed.",0
1034,"Portillos doesn't have the best hot dog nor the best Italian beef. However, if you're in a rush and you need something that is really good, you should come here and get your fix.

Prices are on point and can't say i've ever had a bad meal here.",1
1035,"Had Italian beef for the first time. It was tasty. The bread was a little soggy, but a native told me you should specify the dip level to have dry bread.",1
1036,I can’t go into much detail about a hotdog but it was great. Very flavorful and crisp. I will definitely come back to Portillo’s the next time I’m in Chicago.,1
1037,Pretty good Chicago area favorite. Beat chocolate cake I've had which makes a pretty good cake shake as well. Good for a quick bite if you're looking for some classic Chicago cuisine.,1
1038,Mama T was so much fun! She really made the restaurant feel alive. I will definitely be back to enjoy some of those great signature hot dogs.,1
1039,"This place is definitely a Chicago classic! I ordered the big beef sandwich with a sweet peppers and mozzarella cheese, large fries and a tamale. What an awesome lunch!!!",1
1040,"BEWARE!! Food was as expected but during our meal my wallet was stolen out of my zippered handbag while we were at the table. Tried to talk to a manager, approached three associates asking for a manager, none responded. CALLED twice, no management ever picked up. Beware and find your hot dogs elsewhere!",0
1041,Have to try the beef sandwich and fries. Best beef sandwich ever. The kids love the hot dogs and the wife like the burgers. Everything taste so fresh. Friendly service every time we come here.,1
1042,"Famous Portillo’s. Nice Italian beef, Chocolate Cake Shake is amazing. Don’t make the mistake I made and order a burger; order what they’re known for",1
1043,"I was waiting for my chicken salad for 20 minutes and when I got it there was no bread and no strow for my drink, I didn’t wanted wait anymore so I just took off worst service ever on Oswego site",0
1044,"Great food. But the drive thru in this location needs a bit improvement.  It gets busy, and the line goes quite slow.  So if you pull in expect at least a good 15-20min wait in the drive thru line. Worst thing about it is that there is no way out, cars will block you from the back and you're stuck. Gotta wait it out.",1
1045,My first time in Chicago I wanted to try the Chicago dog. 5 stars all day. Would highly recommend this location.,1
1046,"So, I don’t want to be mean but I ordered my food through Postmates and I live 20 minutes away. When my food arrived it was not even close and missing a few items. I called the restaurant multiple times and no answer so I had to drive to the restaurant to correct my order because Postmates was still “reviewing “ my order. When I arrived levante I believe his name was was extremely sweet and helped me with my order and got me a manager and the manager was nice but didn’t take anything g seriously. I get that people mistakes but what annoyed me the most is the cashier I think her name was Joseline said when Levante went to get a manager she stated “none of customers are ever happy”. I’m seriously right in front of you and I was extremely respectful. I don’t get why you are working there if you are going to have an attitude.",0
1047,"Outstanding. The hot dog exceeded my expectations for a Chicago dog. Chili dog delicious too. Great atmosphere, helpful staff, reasonable prices.",1
1048,"I don't understand why this place is so popular. Nothing is good here and the spot to pick up your food is sooo chaotic. We tried the burger, beef sandwich, chili dog, and regular hot dogs. Didn't like anything.",0
1049,"If you want a classic roast beef sandwich, I'd definitely recommend Portillo's over ""that other place"". For one thing their giardiniera is higher quality and the whole sandwich will taste way better anyway. oh, and don't eat these in the car and I'd recommend lots of napkins too.",1
1050,"Was in chicago for the weekend and portillo's is a must. Didnt realize we went after a Cubs game got out and waited a while and our order was wrong, my Italian beef wasnt dipped and had no giardiniera. Wasnt worth the wait to try and fix it. That and all the drunk kids( not portillo's fault but still annoying) are the only reason for 3 stars.",1
1051,"I am so glad I had the privilege of visiting this fine establishment on my trip to chacago. Mama T managed to greet us and the other 50 people who walked through that door to assist us in out orders. She showed us which line to stand in to order (there were several) and where to pick up (again, several places) THE. FOOD. WAS. AWESOME. The price? CHEAP especially for chicago. I was sad I didn't get to go again before I left. It's very busy, and very hard to find a table..... if you ask an employee they will help you find one.",1
1052,"Better than I was expecting!  This is a neat place, with options for anyone and everything and all appetites! From a light lunch to a massive dinner, you can get it all here. It feels very family friendly and the staff are friendly and helpful.",1
1053,"The chocolate cake a la mode was delicious, and the server was friendly. It was a nice late-night snack stop. It was busy but not as crowded as I had expected.",1
1054,This is the third time I've come by in a month (ordered catering for 2 different days and entertained done out of town guests) and every time its so unorganized. Employees vocally don't want to be there and everyone is stressed out not knowing what to do. This place used to be much better than this.,0
1055,Nice place great dogs and wonderful shakes.,1
1056,"Personally I think the place is over rated, I mean it's just hot-dogs and beef sandwiches...
They're always busy, your order might take a little while and always check your bag- last time I waited 20 minutes for 3 hotdogs and 1 beef sandwich.. C'mon everything is ready its not like you have to cook anything or wait to slaughter a cow!
They still got the order wrong, but I ain't mad a'cha..",1
1057,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. It is dirty, unorganized, and the staff is EXTREMELY rude. When placing my order the girl taking my order looked annoyed. Now, if you can’t handle customer service, THEN GO WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE. I ignored it because I thought “you’re nasty attitude is what doesn’t let you move up in life and you’re stuck working here you low life piece of trash”. When my food was ready, it tasted jorrible. The bread was broken, the condiments were not on the hot dog, they were on the wrapper, it was just gross and a mess. Don’t waste your time or money coming here, worst experience ever.",0
1058,"Always busy, but that’s when you know the food is great. If you can withstand the long line, this place is an excellent choice.",1
1059,Google time is WRONG.  Got to the door at 10:55pm on a Thursday. They locked the doors because closing is 11pm. Simple change of time on Google would many a trip.,0
1060,This place was amazing. They even have drive up in a crowded city! I really enjoyed the fun atmosphere here. I do think they're ordering and pick up areas are odd but the food was worth it.,1
1061,"Was after a Chicago style hot dog, and found it at Portillos. It is a big dining hall with plenty of seating. The hot dog was very tasy, but actually a bit small (I would recommend ordering two or the jumbo hotdog). There was a dessert counter as well where I got some frozen custard which was pretty good. The food was cheap and service fast.",1
1062,"Delicious and affordable. Known for it's Chicago style hot dogs and and burgers, Portillo's offers a wide range of items and makes a surprisingly good salad.

The service is quick, the staff is polite and the seating is casual. If you're dining with people that enjoy this kind of food, you can't go wrong.

Most visitors drift towards deep dish pizza, the Rainforest Cafe or the massive McDonalds - all within a few blocks of Portillo's - but the smart move is to head to Portillo's.",1
1063,"Atmosphere is great. Hot dogs are ok, nothing that will blow you away. The famous chocolate cake was alright, again nothing that will blow you away. I prefer the lava cake from chili, Just comparing.",1
1064,"I'm not really big on busy touristy spots, but you MUST visit this place.  It's a staple for downtown Chicago and it really doesn't disappoint.  I love the chili cheese dogs!",1
1065,"One word 2 sum up dis place. Iconic

If you wanna get a real hot dog come here",1
1066,"Absolutely loved it,  wait times were a little long but that's perfectly fine because the quality of the food is absolutely stellar, the employees are super nice and the ambiance is amazing. I definitely reccomend coming here regularly.",1
1067,Waited for simple burger 35 min,1
1068,"Definitely an experience to bring in when visiting Chicago. It was the first place we went for food. Affordable, fresh, and pretty easy. They definitely have a system here and do a good job for the amount of people they serve.",1
1069,"Get an Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers and asked for it ""dipped"". Then order a small cheese fry and pour half the cheese on the sandwich. SO GOOD. Also a chocolate cake shake is a must. 10 stars if I could",1
1070,"Good food! When I went, there was a huge crowd and it took quite a while to get our food, and the way it's set up, we had to push our way through a throng of people to get to the pickup counter, but the chocolate cake was delicious",1
1071,"Hand's down the best Flame Broiled burgers in America! I will not go to Chicago without going here at least once, twice if I am blessed enough! Wish they had one in Indianapolis, I would really be broke but filled with love from my family and and Portillo's incredible hamburgers and rootbeer.",1
1072,I thought the Italian Beef was very good. The crowd was a bit overwhelming and honestly the experience felt a little over hyped. The staff did a really good job of moving a lot of people and product.,1
1073,Best place ever. So tasty and delicious,1
1074,"Great place.
service...............burger and stake sandwich not the best. the sandwich bread, comes out  very very saggy to the point it was impossible to eat",1
1075,"line its a nightmare paying in one place to drop he bag for our order on another.
we order two hotdogs our order came with just one but somone help us to receieve our second hot dog.
hot dog was cold not good at all at least e fries were hot.",0
1076,"Classic Americana covers the walls! This place is adorable and quirky and smells awesome, the Chicago hotdog is pure joy! We're definitely going to head back as soon as possible",1
1077,I love Portillos but they couldn't handle the crush of people and it ruined it a bit. Had to wait way too long and seemed quite unorganized. Italian Combo was amazing as always! I'd hope that it was just World Series traffic that threw them off their game.,1
1078,"I went to purchase a chocolate cake for a friend's retirement party - it's her favorite!
While there was a wait for a table,  I was able to get in and out in 5 minutes with my purchase!
*The caveat is that parking is nil: I joined the foolhardy ""blinker cars"" in front. .. lucky us: no ticket!
BTW: THE CAKE WAS DELICIOUS!",1
1079,"Very cool vibe in the building , awful food , and service . Took 15 min to fix the mess up on my order by then my food was soggy and grose ..  Needs more than meat and bread on a sandwich  guys. My son said his dog was good so I was content with eating some meat off the bun and threw the rest away.",0
1080,Great environment. Old fashioned. The combination of food and environment was really great!,1
1081,This place has been so hyped. I was visiting so tried the Chicago dog which was average. The chocolate cake was average at best. I'll try something else just to see if it really does hold up to the hype.,1
1082,"I have to say, even though I dont get excited about hotdogs, Chicago style really does bring something new to the party. Went with a Chicago classic at Portillos, and it lived up to the hype. I recon it to be how Delesandros brings a new order to the boring plain of overcooked meat and melted cheese that is the Philly cheesesteak; the Chicago style dog energizes the pallet to what is otherwise a gastro atrocity.",1
1083,Chain restaurant that’s lost it’s touch. The Italian beef was dry and not at all what one imagines. Onion rings were good though so there’s 3 stars.,1
1084,I've never been and I live in Utah. But I saw something on YouTube about the Cake shake and had to give them 5 stars.,1
1085,"Awesome hot dogs, but the star of the night is the italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers. Delicious. The chocolate cake shake was amazing as well",1
1086,"This is the worst Portillo’s location I have ever been to. The employees aren’t fully trained on the menu and frequently mess up orders. They were not sensitive to my allergy request and were unaware of ingredients. You have to stand to wait for your food for over 20 mins, or more. I’ve never experienced a worse location or wait time at other restaurants. I am a regular at Portillo’s but I will never go to this location again. They are not accommodating or polite. Poor customer service.",0
1087,I had to wait 30 minutes for them to deliver the half ribs that I ordered. My family had to start eating to keep the hot dogs from getting cold so I finished eating Alone. I have ticket 52 and I saw them delivering ticket 112 with Ribs(i suposed that only could saw the aluminum foil).  Sorry for my bad english I use google translator,0
1088,For those that have never heard of the comedian Gabriel Iglesias I highly recommend you go look at his bit on this restaurant. He speaks equally as highly of this as I do myself. I don't have anything to add that he didn't or dimension of how amazing it was.,1
1089,"First Chicago dog experience - Portillo's is the classic go-to and did not disappoint. Would go back in a heartbeat for more sloppy, overflowing goodness. Also, chocolate cake shake. Yeah, I could consume those exclusively for the rest of my life.",1
1090,"Get yet hot dog and move on not a ""hangout spot"" streamlined service great for a quick bite but it's a busy place.",1
1091,"I love Portillos!  When I have friends that come to visit Chicago from out of town and want the classic Chicago dog, I take them here!

The classic Chicago dog with pickle, hot peppers, onion, mustard and relish is awesome!  I'm also a big fan of the chili cheese dog!

Besides the hot dogs my favorite thing at Portillos is the cake shake!  It's like heaven in a cup!  If you love chocolate try it your life will be changed forever!",1
1092,"Jumbo hotdog is not really ""jumbo size"". But it has good taste. The fries did not impressed me though... It's a traditional place and kind of a must in Chicago.",1
1093,"Incredible food.  This place is the taste of Chicago!   I recommend the combo with hot peppers and gravy on the side,  it's an Italien beef with a polish sausage inside.   It's a delectable masterpiece.",1
1094,A must visit place while in Chicago! Lots of great dishes. Loved the Italian Beef sandwich. Parking is very sparse on the street. Plan to look around for parking.,1
1095,Famous Chicago hot dogs served here. Crowded most of the time. Their service model is to order and pickup by number. There are many windows serving different options. The whole thing can be a bit confusing with the large crowds.,1
1096,"Came to this place the recommendation of many people from Chicago. This place was overwhelming disappointing. I got the big beef and it had no flavor and was extremely soggy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Save yourself the trouble and go to McDonald's,or grab a hotdog off the ground and save cash.",0
1097,"Employee Ciara was extremely rude to my husband and I , didn’t even greet us as we approached her to the register to order our food.  She just gave us a blank stare didn’t say how can I help you or anything , so awkwardly we just started ordering our food.  Just had an attitude the whole time she was taking our order, had nothing friendly to say or anything .",0
1098,"Good hot dog, amazing venue",1
1099,"This is one of few downtown restaurants open late that isn't super high cost. Hot dog, beer, and downtown Chicago. Nothing better.",1
1100,I was on a work trip and found my hotel to be a two minute walk from Portillo's. It was a fun place to eat. I went there twice on my work trip for lunch. The Chicago dogs are delicious!,1
1101,"Good chicken sandwich, the pasta was not good. Beware parking across the street at the Walgreens parking lot, I saw 4 cars get toed in minutes that were eating here.",1
1102,"The food is always great, you can't go wrong! The employees at this location were super helpful and very nice!  The restaurant looked clean, and there were a couple employees thay kept walking by to make sure of it.",1
1103,Great chili and cheese hot dog. Hot fries and cold beer. Love the atmosphere.,1
1104,"Busy as all ways, reason being. . . Portillos is AWESOME! Can't find a better Italian combo or Double Bacon Cheese Burger with grilled onions. Don't forget the onion rings and large strawberry shake.",1
1105,"For fast food, it's really a great place. Food is super good and they offer tons of different dishes. The interior equipment is actually a quite nice corporate design, I liked it.",1
1106,"The fact that this place is across the street from a McDonald's and a Hard Rock should have been enough for me to keep walking.  Being that this place is a ""must-see-and-do"" while in Chicago, I couldn't.

Full disclaimer: I have visited the location in Buena Park, CA.  I expected the original to  look less like an ""amusement park"" and more like an authentic Chicago eatery.  I was wrong.

You walk in and it is a daunting task to figure out how and where to stand in line.  I counted at least eight different lines and they all seemed to go in three directions simultaneously.  Confusion.  I walked to the far right and stood in line.  There is a staffer waiting to take your order.  She was standing about 10 feet from the register.  You take the order the order taker took and you hand it to the cashier.  She confirms the the order.  Not sure why the two-step process, but ok, it is putting people to work.

Then it is a mad dash to get a table.  Tables everywhere, but none available.  You are eyeballing hot dogs covered in chili and cheese and half-eaten pickles on soaked napkins to see who will be ready to go.  You look at feet and knees and hips.  You are ready to pounce on the next available seat.  You don't care that it is dirty.  You spot the tourist.  They are frantically zipping and unzipping, folding and unfolding, and patting themselves down.  They are ready to leave.  They might need another minute.  Meanwhile the table with the locals, or so they appear, cleanly throw all their used paper goods into the bag that had their order written on it.  They wipe the table and before the last person in their party stands...I sit in an available chair as though the music had just stopped and I get to stay in the game a little longer.

Order numbers are called out.  It feels more like an auction house than anything else.  Numbers are being called, yelled really, into a microphone and out of speakers that were set too loud too long ago.  While you wait for your number to be be screamed out you stop and look around.  Two restaurants seem to share this address.  Or is it three restaurants.

The sports memorabilia lines the walls.  Chicago Pride on display.  You can google the various ""art"" that hangs here.  I won't bore you with it.  Let's just say that all three major sports are represented.  The decor seems disney-lite and the sports-stuff seems as though displayed by a hoarder.  To each his own.  To. Each. His. Own.

Was that my number?!??!

I can't wait.  The expectation is much to high.  Can so many people be so completely wrong?

The short answer?

Uh huh.  They can.

I live in L.A. We have a place that is just as overrated and just as packed.  It is called Pink's.  They slang these snappy, warm-but-cold-but-warm, meat sticks (they call Hot Dogs) into bread.  You can get it plain or with the works.  Cover it up so you don't taste it or get it naked so it can't hide.

Portillo's is exactly the same.  They slang these snappy, warm-but-cold-but-warm, meat sticks (they call Hot Dogs) into bread.  You can drown out the ""snappy"" with chili or cheese or chicago-style-stuff.  It is still a snappy, overpriced, warm-but-cold-but-warm meat stick that lacks all the flavor you'd think it might considering the adjectives used here.

The fries were good.  A little salty, but crunchy.

Would I go back?  Pfft.  Should you experience this place for yourself?

You could walk in. Stand in line for three minutes. Listen to the cacophony of tourists, workers, cooks, etc... and then walk a few blocks and get some decent food.  Up to you.  You've been warned.",0
1107,Super cute looking restuarant the food is good too! We had three hot dogs 2 pops and the strawberry shortcake. I would come here again for sure!,1
1108,Best hot dog n town. Love it. U have to visit this place if u visit Chicago.🌭🌭,1
1109,My visit occurred on 10/16 at around 8:39 I placed my order I didn't receive my food until 9:05 the wait was reasonable. I finished what I could and went back up to the pick up line to get a refill on soda and containers to go. I first was avoided by multiple employees that seemed more entertained in conversating with each other. They were not working on orders just standing around and talking amongst each other. The girl passed by so I asked her for a refill. She seemed upset that I was asking. She said they need someone standing here. I said I'm sorry. She repeated they need someone standing here. She said yeah you want to work here sarcastically. I told her I'm good I have a job. She then said it's always good to have 2-3 jobs. I then repeated to her I have a job. I also needed containers to go. I asked for that and once again she had an attitude. Horrible customer service experience ever. I will not be coming to this location anymore. The only reason why I came to this portillos was for Barnellis pasta. The service was TRASH. I would give no stars for the service but in order to write the review I need to put one.,0
1110,"Best Italian beef wit hot,sweet pepper's DIP and cake shake in the city and best of all is there was no long lines  DELICIOUS",1
1111,"We had the classic Chicago Dog, chili dog, Italian beef sandwich, fries, and chocolate cake.  Everything we had was great!  We visited twice while we were in town on vacation.",1
1112,The theming in this one is by far the best out of any of their locations and their food is on par - can be crowded so not always as fast as the other locations but definitely a must. PS. Some of the best cheese fries imo.,1
1113,"Spent a good portion of my lunch break waiting on my food.  20 minutes after ordering, no food.  It was heart breaking to see half my food sitting in the counter and the staff not getting the other half ready.  It was even more upsetting to watch 20+ people who were in line after me get their food before me.",0
1114,The best hot dogs in Chicago!,1
1115,The food was delicious which maked this place worth stopping by but we had to wait longer than expected.  And they didn't get half our order right. They were a little busy I wouldnt have expected to wait 25 minutes and still get half our order wrong. My suggestion is to definitely have your sandwich dipped. Can't go wrong there.,1
1116,Always a fun time to bring a group of friends. Service is quick but do send a scout to find a table - AFTER you order your food. Holding a table prior to ordering is rude.,1
1117,I really like the theme inside the food court.,1
1118,"I’ve been coming here for years, the service is the worst no matter what time of day. Always missing items, always wait in a 50+ minute line and end up sending back items multiple times, to not even end up with what I ordered. I just give up sending it back and take whatever they give me. Doesn’t matter if I order ahead or not, go inside or drive through. Replace everyone at this location immediately.",0
1119,"Fantastic sandwiches, wish they would open one up in Texas!!",1
1120,"Best place to try Chicago Style Hot Dog and Cheese Fries! My favorite place so far. Other menu looks great as well, plan to try in in future...

Thank you Portillo's!",1
1121,The drive thru speaker may not work but when you have a guy outside who knows his menu why would you bother fixing it. The Chicago hotdogs are pretty good but don’t forget to double check you get your dressings before you leave the drive thru.,1
1122,"Nothing special, just burgers and 🍟",0
1123,"I wish I could have tried everything, literally. This place is amazing. Hot dogs - perfect, Italian meat sandwich - incredible... As a tourist in Chicago I had to try this place.... twice.",1
1124,"Yum yum yum
Cool place and vibing atmosphere , tasty food and fun experience

Some of the staff need to follow the older gentleman calling out numbers , hardly hear some of them & watched some food sit there for quite some time..

Only other thing there seems to only be stairs to get up to the rest room, which makes it a bit of a struggle lugging a baby up to change them.",1
1125,"Really solid unhealthy food. I had an Italian beef dipped with hot peppers. Solo delicious yet unhealthy.

Decent price.

It was hella crowded during lunch on a weekday. Recommend avoiding busy times.",1
1126,Me being from Texas i would expect there food to be decent but turns out Chicago can hold it down with the dogs. The environment makes you feel like your back in the 80’s-90’s with its unique art style and great food.,1
1127,Great food. Fairly fast service. They left things off our order and when I asked they told me they didn't. Had to go back. Super friendly workers but the fast pace is difficult to keep up.,1
1128,"This place is terrible. The food is OK. And the management and employees are so rude. I ordered food, then went to order a beer and they denied me because my license was "" vertical "". I'm 22 years old going on 23 and had 7 different cards in my wallet with my name on it and was still denied. Not only that, but the manager could not be more rude.   Not a bad idea to skip this place in your trip to Chicago.",0
1129,"Great grub, decent prices",1
1130,"I ordered a turkey panini. After 30 minutes of wait, I ask for my order, nothing happens. 35 min later, the manager comes and tells me they don't have any more turkey for my order. AFTER 35 MIN WAITING they realized they never paid any attention to my order, made me wait and the manager didn't even apologized. He did nothing to make it up or even felt bad about it. HORRIBLE SERVICE.",0
1131,Ordered online three days in a row. Continued to have problems with receiving my food. It never showed. Gave them the benefit of the doubt. Will NEVER order from them again. It’s hard to get in contact with a manger. Now I must physically go to the restaurant for a refund.,0
1132,"Very busy. And chaotic. Wasn't clear when we'd get our drinks. Had to go ask for them otherwise they would have forgotten it seems.
Good food. Decent prices.",1
1133,"get. the. italian. beef. it will change your life, i promise. they also had great onion rings and fries. great price for delicious food! and such speedy service!",1
1134,Well bottom line that if you are looking for the beta hotdog you will ever taste in your life or Italian beef then this is the place . Portillo hotdog in Chicago is the best local restaurant wether it's for the food or the decor or the service . The only reason I gave them 4 stars because their grilled tuna sandwich is horrible and they need to take it off the menu.,1
1135,Messed up my order. I got home called manager who started would give me credit when zip had a chance to come back. When I did none knew what I was talking about. Did not put hot or sweet peppers on my beef. 2 bbeefs were not dipped and  up of cheese missing. How dumb is this staff.,0
1136,By far one of my favorite resturants since I have been here in chicago my favorite is their bacon burger which I believe is one of the best on their menu's Ive also had there delicious shakes. the resturamt itself is themed making it very family friendly.,1
1137,If you want to try the Chicago's hot dogs you should come to this place. It's fast and delicious. I ate with two friends and we paid around 20 dollars. I highly recommend this restaurant,1
1138,"Nice place once you get past the kitch. While in line, a staff member approaches you and writes your order on a paper bag. Get to the register, and your order is rung up. Stand by and wait a few minutes while trying to decipher your order number out of the nearly unintelligible noise being called over the PA. I got the wet Italian beef, which was wonderful.",1
1139,"Do NOT order from the Barnelli's side. Worst customer service ever. The cashier disappeared for 10 mins, had us waiting for 15 mins. The manager didnt seem to came. Another crew member told us to step to the Portillo's side and when I explained my situation she turned her back to me. If you want good Portillo's, good service I'd recommend going to the location in Summit.",0
1140,"I am giving this place 5 stars for two reasons:
1) The Italian Beef sub is probably the best thing next to mashed potatoes, and
2) The lady calling out the order numbers has a great sense of humor and likes to rhyme the numbers.

Portillos gets a large crowd and for good reason: the food is reasonably priced and unbelievably delicious. I didn't think $6 subs still existed, let alone one with spicy pickles completely dipped into gravy.  One might say ""hey, that seems like it would make the bread soggy"", but nay! It is magical and stays rather chewy while it melts in your mouth with goodness.

Friends, this is the real deal. If you're visiting Chicago, come here around 3PM and split an Italian Beef with spicy peppers dipped and a Portillo's hotdog with your friend. I bravely ate both of them and walked out of there stuffed, but extremely happy. My tastebuds thanked me profusely as the beef melted in my mouth and the light spicy peppers really added the extra flavors needed for a beautiful meal.

For the Chicago dog, it may not be everyone's thing. They put a salad onto a quality hotdog on a toasted sesame bun - it's definitely not a nyc waterdog. There is literally a spear of pickle in the center and no ketchup. I know someone who likes to put ketchup on her ketchup, so this is definitely not her jam (er... ketchup).

All in all, I'll be here again the next time I'm in Chicago. I'm currently in the search for something similar in NYC. I guess I'll just have to settle for Katz.",1
1141,First of all the food was amazing. Considering the crowd the line was fast and the service was amazing. Mama T was the nicest employee and helped everyone out. Mama t needs a promotion and is one of the best workers I have seen in the restaurant industry,1
1142,First time in Chicago. Met a friendly local in line who suggested the all beef sandwich. It was delicious! Great atmosphere and great food. Can't wait to go back.,1
1143,Excellent food and atmosphere!! Chi Towns finest,1
1144,"This eternally busy spot is always neat as a pin if you are eating ""in"" which is a remarkable feat.  Most of my meals are picked up at the drive through window, though, where they are efficient under challenging circumstances.  The staples are yummy, but the real secret special is the grilled tuna sandwich -- unusual and delicious!",1
1145,"Get a Chicago-style hot dog with everything and some cheese fries on the side, and enjoy it for the first hour (then regret it an hour later when the heartburn hits).

Drink water, not a chocolate cake shake.",1
1146,"An incredibly good beef sandwich with hot jardinera,  the char dog hot dog is excellent.
I wish we had more Portillo's in the Los Angeles area.
Good fast food.",1
1147,"Outside food coordinator was a delight even with covid crowds in the Chicago winter. Classic portillo's quality, always recommend the Chicago dog!",1
1148,I love this place's idea of having different foods in the same place as a food court. It is really good when you are in a group with different people. Also the pasta is great and I am willing to go back there to try all the options that they offer.,1
1149,"We are from out of town, I called to place an order and in the middle of taking an order was placed on a hold just for someone else to get on the line to say that she cannot take our order and I would need to contact some center. She was rude and dismissive without any effort to help.",0
1150,Incredible and very filling food. I recommend the chocolate cake shake.,1
1151,Please restructure the service.    You have to order in two different places.  At 3 pm had to wait 20 min for one order and 45 min for the other.  Visiting from NJ for a Italian beef by the time it got to me it was soggy and gross asked for peppers on th side came on th sandwich.  They also forgot part of our order.   You wait wait wait .  Kills the experience ...and in my case the weight killed my food !,0
1152,"Awesome food and atmosphere. No matter what you order, get a cake shake for dessert. Best shake of my life!",1
1153,"Food is great, cool place with some neat memorabilia.  Not the best Italian beef but worth a try.  Chocolate cake is famous for a reason.",1
1154,"If throwing in half a cucumber and other huge chunks of vegetables into a hot dog bun is how Chicagoans enjoy it well great, but not me. New york still hot dog stand is my fave",0
1155,Hot Dog Restaurant - Wonderful tasting Hot Dogs in a fun and laid back atmosphere.  Every bite keeps you craving for more - this is a must visit place for those who love their dogs!,1
1156,Our usual to-go place when we run out of groceries and have to grab something cheap and filling. I absolutely love their Chocolate cake.. Chicken Caesar salad is my favourite.,1
1157,"The food here is mostly average but my wife was obsessed with the chocolate cake shake here, said it was ""the best shake she has ever had"" and would probably make me sleep on the couch if I gave them anything less than 4 stars.",1
1158,"If your order doesn't get lost, it might be worth the wait. Honestly mediocre food for a good price. Took an hour to get our food and then everything was wrong. But at that point we didn't care. Wouldn't repeat.",0
1159,"Phenomenal Italian Beef.
Fries:  nothing special and dulled the sensation of the sandwich.
All you suga' lova's:  the chocolate cake shake teems those veins with sucre in no-time.
Decor:  cool hodgepodge of  Chi-town salvage.
Staff: terse and seemingly overworked; however, service quality is good despite the constant flux of orders.",1
1160,The staff was very accommodating. We had a large group on our class trip and they gave us the upper dinning room for us to all sit together. Definitely recommend,1
1161,Meet expectations. Excellent food.,1
1162,"Don’t order delivery. Tried to order online on their website twice. Their app failed both times. Ordered online via Uber Eats. Took three hours and they got the order totally wrong.

Chicago staple. But go in person",0
1163,"Portillo's is always fire, you already famo 💯",1
1164,My go to places I at least eat here 2 times while I'm in Chicago. Love the beef hot dogs and the Custard. Never had the bbq hear it's great,1
1165,"This Portillo's location is rapidly becoming the worst Portillo's of them all. I can complain about all my last 5 visits, about the drop in quality of food - but the absolute worst part: is how clear as day it has become on how much the employees clearly just do not care about their jobs, the food, nor us the customers - at all.  Portillo's should be embarrassed with what this location has become, but I am done going here completely.  I will spend my money at all the other food establishments that surround this place - that do care & appreciate their customers.",0
1166,"Food is good, wait time not good. Thankfully I grabbed a table while my husband ordered or we wouldn’t have anywhere to sit, wait time for food was long. Hot Dogs were good though.",1
1167,Great place for some Chicago style eats. Recently hosted an event here and it was very well done. The food was excellent and the service was top notch. Great prices too!,1
1168,"My Italian Beef was a soggy deliciousness masterpiece. Thank you for the amazing sandwich!  Excellent Service & Speed!
I be back 1000x!!!",1
1169,I thought it was awful. The dog was so tough. The onion rings were so crunchy I had to tear them apart to even eat some of them. No onion flavor left after they were done with them. Won't be back.,0
1170,"Solid good ole American fast food. I only had the classic Chicago hot dog and the chicken noodle soup here. Both were solid, I really enjoyed the soup, actually.",1
1171,"Everything was great.  Awesome menu selection.  At certain times it could become quite crowded, but it's well worth the wait.  I'm a Chicago native and I can't wait until construction of Portillo's is finished",1
1172,"I was amazed, this place was delicious. The Italian beef & salad was recommended & terrific. Their chocolate cake was in great demand when we took it back to our hotel!",1
1173,"Employee nags you to put mask on. Was waiting to do a refill and she also thought i was waiting for food and try to have me wait in a different section. Other than that the food is okay, pretty expensive.",0
1174,Long lines but great chopped salad!,1
1175,Today for lunch I stop by to Portillo's on Ontario. The line was a little bit too long but the chop salad was worth the weight. I recently started a diet and you know just as well as I do it's hard to find food that taste good especially that's fast food. So Portillos chop salad was the perfect way to go for anyone who wants to lose weight and still eat something that taste good.,1
1176,"Portillo’s is a great option for hot dogs. Their Chicago dog is great, the prices could be better but the menu has plenty to try. Much of it should not be skipped.",1
1177,"The food at Portillos is great, specially the hot dogs... the decor makes the experience better...",1
1178,"On a recent business trip to Chicago I decided I was going to eat a Hot Italian Beef for lunch and dinner each day, from a different place (which worked out to be 8 meals).  I have to say that this was only okay.  The service wasn't any better than you'd expect at McDonalds and although the sotto aceti was good, it was really all I could taste.

When I go into an Asian restaurant, I want to see Asian folks making their food.  When I go into a Latin restaurant I want to see Latinos making their food.  When I go into an Italian restaurant...well, I didn't see a single Italian working here.

With that said, I only ate one menu item here and they had several that looked good.  But if I'm going to pick any one menu item to rate the whole of Chicago restaurants, the litmus test is going to be Italian Beef.",1
1179,They only gave me 2 out of the three things I ordered and it was too packed to go back and ask. 4 stars due to the really nice guy directing people. I wish he was able to sit with us,1
1180,"A must for even a short visit. The polish hotdogs or the beef and Italian sandwiches are highly recommended! And to top everything off, frozen custard sundaes right next door!",1
1181,An employee threw me out over having a McDonald’s milkshake inside the restaurant.,0
1182,Great local food at awesome prices. A must try when you’re in Chicago.,1
1183,"Everyone I talked to when I went to Chicago told me to eat at Portillo's Hot Dogs because they were supposedly the best they had ever had. They were right. The good was really good and next time I am in Chicago, I will return.",1
1184,Eat here. Dont look at any other reviews. We ate here everyday while we were in Chicago. The burgers and chicken sandwiches are cooked perfectly and the hot dogs are out of this world.,1
1185,"Ordered food at 9pm, their website said it would be 25 minutes to be delivered.  I get a notification from Door Dash my delivery would at 955pm. 1055pm I get a call from Door Dash and Portillos said my order was picked up by someone else and they would have to remake it. It's 1140 right now and I still don't have any food. Portillos will not answer my calls but yet they still charged me $50 for my order.",0
1186,"A poor man's Arby's. I've never had a less flavorful and more soggy sandwich. Never coming back, so disappointing.  I asked for the best thing there which apparently is the Italian beef, but honestly I'd rather have a homemade pb&j than this again.",0
1187,"No nonsense Hot Dog place in Chicago, this is the place to eat. It's a true high quality fast food joint. Lived their jumbo chilli dog & strawberry milkshake.",1
1188,"Horrible service.  Food delivered more than half hour later with cold food and missing items.  Customer service not responsive, was told they cannot reach manager and there is nothing they can do.",0
1189,"I have never eaten here, but do Postmates deliveries here. In particular, Portillo's is the epitome of fast food, except that the sheer volume of patrons means that the food isn't coming very fast. It usually very crowded, and takes at least 20 minutes to get an order finished. Not my cup of tea at all.",0
1190,"Great food there, we had the Italian beef, hotdogs and some pasta. The place is great as well even though we could not dine-in because of Covid restrictions.",1
1191,One of the best hot dog spots in Chi Town,1
1192,The jumbo Chicago dog here was great but the pricing for fries and a drink to go with were a bit high compared to the price of the dog. Very busy with open seating.,1
1193,Awesome hot dogs!,1
1194,Best beef in Chicago. If you don't know Portillos then you aren't from Chicago. The Chicago classic hotdog is always good here- make sure to get it charred. And of course Italian beef- get it dipped and with peppers.... You can't go wrong.,1
1195,"Stand in line. Order your food. Pick in the crowded area to the left of the register. Beef with hot and sweet peppers dipped is the way to go. If you want a decadent experience, get a cake shake.",1
1196,"Portillo's french fries are the best fries ever- do not forget to order them with a side of tasty,melted cheese. Yammy! My second favorite to order here is the beef brisket sandwich- so tasty.I never leave the place without ordering the tasty Tiramisu!",1
1197,"Coming in protilos for two decades.....I have never have had a problem with them. Well a Sunday afternoon arpund 4:17 pm it was utter chaos, i understand the rush hour time....but watching workers fighting with eachother and the organization of everyone working was terrible. Its just food.....but portillos is always known for great service. I received my chili cheese cold french fries cold and never received my pasta salad......sad day for me.",0
1198,"An absolute must place to visit if you're visiting Chicago.  It's iconic for their Chicago hot dogs, which I love as well as their Italian Beef sandwiches with giardiniera peppers.",1
1199,"Italian beef, Xtra gravy.  It's the only way to go.",1
1200,"From the hot dogs to the Italian beef, the food is delicious and the quality is high. The wait can be a little long, but it's not unreasonable, and it's so totally worth it.",1
1201,Disneyland for hotdog. Might not be the best in town but will not disappoint you. Great for hangout. You can have some time to meet and eat although you don't have to eat the dogs,1
1202,I love portillos  !!!!!¡! But I can't believe that drive through finally got my order right for the first time in over a decade I usually don't do the drive through but finding a place to park in downtown Chicago at that location is  fuuuccckkked up as much money as they make they should buy the damn gas station next door they will get more customers,1
1203,Food was OK but their was a long wait and by the time we got our hotdogs they were soggy.,1
1204,"Some employees not happy to attend. Jumbo is not a definition for a bit hot dog. French fries are ok. For Brazilians, don’t waste your time, our hot dogs are better",0
1205,"Really nice hotdog with good price range. Four hotdogs, one soft drink, one sliced cake cost less than $30
However table wasn't cleaned well.",1
1206,If you visit Chicago and didn't try these place did you really even visit Chicago?  The strawberry shortcake is to die for! Be sure to get an Italian beef dipped and you can thank me later!,1
1207,"Beyond awful! I wouldn't give any stars but I had to put something to do the review.  No organization,  incompetent service,  no leadership whatsoever.  It took 25 minutes in the drive thru.  Once you got in the lone - you were stuck and couldn't get out.",0
1208,Stuck in the drive through for over 40 minutes so far because some guy has a big order and won’t go around!?! And they won’t have him wait away from the drive through because the employees aren’t allowed to go on the street?!?!,0
1209,Been a customer forever.  The Downtown location has pasta which was good for picky kid. Sadly the upstairs seating looked like there was mold on the table cloths.😕,1
1210,"If you like Chicago hotdogs this is the place.  Of course, wide selection of other Chicago favorites, like Italian beef and hamburgers.  Boiled hotdogs on steamed poppy seed buns, though are my favorite.",1
1211,Portillo's is my favorite restaurant and I love Italian beefs and they have the most best quality meat you can ever taste and stick your teeth into.,1
1212,"Worst drive thru I have ever been through. They thought that they lost my order, but no it was sitting there the whole 30 minutes I spent sitting in the sun waiting. They call themselves the speed team what a joke. Stay away.",0
1213,"Best Italian beef I've ever had. Plus the chocolate cake shake is amazing! Seriously, get it. You'll thank me when you do.",1
1214,Should not miss the Chocolate Cake!,1
1215,"hard to rank this place against other sit-down places on food, service, etc., but put simply Portillo's is the champion of hot dog/beef sandwich places; all others wish they could do it as well as this place has for a couple generations; visitors to Chicago should not miss this place.  simply heaven.",0
1216,"Major tourist attraction. Crazy busy. Lots of food options. If you want Chicago Dogs, find a smaller place and spare yourself the wait and the fight for a table.",1
1217,Atmosphere was great 👍 food was very good.,1
1218,Love this place.  Beef is great and the chocolate cake is just like moms.  It's always busy and be prepared for a little shock the first time you stop in.,1
1219,Portillo's made my first Chicago dog experience incredible. I look forward to round two in the future.,1
1220,Its ok i have been there three times they were out of baked potatos all three times.  Out of ribs one day.  The beer is great and the chocolate cake you must try.,1
1221,This place is amazing the food is fresh and the beer is awesome ! The only bad thing is the sitting situation they had a whole second floor empty and no seats or tables available on the first floor. I had to share a table with some thankfully nice people .,1
1222,"I'm not an expert on Chicago dawgs or Italian Beef but this has always been one of my favorite spots, as a visitor to the city, that I love going to eat at and take friends to.

get two traditional Chicago dawgs and split a large order of fries with a friend for the best bang for your buck.",1
1223,"This place was AMAZING when I went in Chicago,IL. They had LEGENDARY food and their shop was massive and HUMONGOUS. I also LOVED their SWAG and PRANKSTER GANGSTER photo booth. It was the most PRANKSTER GANGSTER place I have ever been to.",1
1224,"Chocolate cake shake
Need i say more",1
1225,Took a while to get the order but it was worth the wait. Great place to pick up lunch and just have and overall good time. Huge menu and fun atmosphere,1
1226,Great experience! We brought a group of 42. Michael welcomed us and made adjustments to the seating area to accommodate our large group. Ashley took charge of the orders and our group enjoyed the Portillos experience!,1
1227,We order for delivery my coworker and I. The food was ready on time by portillos. Unfortunately the delivery got to us late for over an hour. Doordash (they are the ones that handled the delivery) were horrible with dealing with us regarding their driver. They kept us on hold for 25 min and then hung up the phone. I cant blame portillos because they did their part perfectly and on time.,1
1228,"Look, if you're going to run a tourist trap this is the way to do it. Giant space full of memorabilia with fast moving lines. Stop by, grab a Chicago Dog and a cold beer and enjoy a unique regional taste.

Just whatever you do don't get the mai tai - it's so criminally bad I wonder why then even serve it.",1
1229,"Over hyped! Very disappointed overall. I thought I’d be eating Portilio’s every day that I was in town but after the first time, my suspicions were unfounded and I was left wondering what all the excitement was about. Bland shakes and average food. Pass.",0
1230,"The food here is soooooo good. The only problem is every single time I've gone, the service was exceptionally slow. The line was almost out the door and I usually had to wait 25+ minutes to just order my food. Then I had to wait another 30 for the order to be ready. By then, it would be so crowded that there would be no where to sit.",1
1231,"Chicago must-have.  If you are in Chicago, you must go to Portillos's.  It's quick, pretty cheap and most importantly, mouthwatering lay delicious.

Service:  the staff walking around the dining area are really kind.  They take your trays and anything you are done with if you are sitting there a whole so definitely thank them!

Food:  If you are looking for tummy filling burgers, sandwiches and hot dogs, this is the perfect place.  But I would say the highlight of Portillo's is their chocolate cake shake (which has actual chunks of chocolate cake) and their strawberry shortcake (which is so light and fluffy you'll think you can eat 10 of them).  Barnelli's is also connected in case you want something healthier...",1
1232,We ordered food for 6 coworkers (including me) for a pick up. A coworker picked the food up and when she arrived we opened the bags and one sandwich was missing. We called portillos and we literally stayed on the phone with them for almost an hour just to deliver a sandwich. This is nonsense. They don’t double check what food they put inside the bags!,0
1233,My bread was soggy and order was wrong. They did correct right away. But the youg lady giving orders out was super. She is the reason for 4 stars or it would be 3 stars,1
1234,"This place has burgers, dogs, salads, pastas, sandwiches, alcohol and much more. The price s are very reasonable. Very clean place and restrooms are clean too. It is very casual and kid friendly. I highly recommend this place.",1
1235,Hot dogs are amazing I don't think I'll ever be able to eat a hotdog without pickles ever again,1
1236,Yum Yum. More than just hotdogs,1

1242,"Good as usual.  Consistency is the key.  Our party of six enjoyed the classic Italian beef, Beef Sausage combo and some pasta.",1
1243,"Good food made to order (that deserves 5 stars), TERRIBLE DRIVE THRU!!!  You have people waiting in front of you who haven't gotten their food and yet you get yours but can't get out of the lines because for whatever reason they haven't gotten theirs.  So you wait and get hungry and eventually say the hell with it and start eating and by the time you do get out of the drive thru you've already finished your food.  People want to go home or work with their hot food, not wait in some drive thru line starving because some fool ordered a complicated order or ordered everything in the menu.  Get them out FASTER!!!",0

Currently there are seven drivers in line waiting for there orders, and there is one person behind the counter attempting to service all the drivers. They are ever prepared for high volume take out orders. They have workers standing around and doing very little. Very disappointing experience every time I’m here.",0

My daughter & I were not disappointed!!! And you better not forget the chocolate cake....YOU WILL TRULY BE MISSING A TREAT!!,1
1252,I was told to go here while traveling and it did not disappoint. All I got was the cake shake but it was SO GOOD and I want to try their hotdogs next visit back.,1
1253,Italian sausage on croissant was tasty. Chocolate cake shake was the best!,1
1254,The food here is simply AWESOME!!!,1
1255,Best Chicago dog ever! The place is always hopping and with great people. We went to the Hard Rock Cafe and they are the ones who suggested it.,1
1256,What's not to love? Great Italian beef and Chicago Dawgs.,1
1257,I give it 4 stars and not 5 because I don't love italian beef. This place is a chain and truly does NOT feel like one. All these places are awesome and probably have the best italian beef in the city.,1
1258,"Side salad is a meal.  Chicago dog was beyond excellent.  Wasn't huge on the chili cheese dog, but that might be personal bias",1
1259,I Loved Portillos ! Delicious Variety of Food ! Great Atmosphere and Old Fashioned music.We will go there again for sure!,1
1260,The food was awesome and filling,1
1261,A Chicago classic and a must-go. Get your hot dogs dipped...trust me...it's amazingly delicious.,1
1262,"Terrible experience this time unfortunately.  We always expect to wait, but this time we waited for a wrong sandwich, 2 forgotten cheese sauces, no straws or ketchup or napkins, and cold fries. Not worth the 30 bucks for fast food dinner tonight.",0
1263,The food was good. Very crowded.  I think the amount of beef on the sandwiches is less than it used to be. Someone said that's due to the new owners.,1
1264,"Same quality it always has , you’ll most likely see a long line but it moves fast and they will get you order correct.",1

Pro Tip: Drive thru looks like a mess, but they are really organized in getting you in and out. Just go with the flow.",1
1269,"The food was good. However, we had to wait over 35 minutes for our two hot dogs to come. Very bad attendance. It is not worth it.",0

Ordered Chicken sandwiches the lettuce was brown not green, the delivery service was 1 hour and 1/2 for disgusting food to arrive. Items missing from my order.

1272,All I can say is gosh dang this place is serving up some tasty savory foods. The Chicago bowl was something else. Will need to be back to Chicago soon.,1
1273,My husabnd likes it but I'm indifferent. While the dogs are fun it would be nice to have some lighter options. Ordering and seating are chaotic but it's touristy so that's to be expected.,1

1279,This place is usually busy.  Don't park your car without paying for park you will be ticketed nearly instantly.  The drive thru is probably your best bet but be prepared to be crowded by other cars in a two lanes.,1
1280,"As others have noticed, surprising how juicy is the Italian beef, and the signature hot dog was really good !! Note: this is a tourist visiting first time in Chicago.",1
1281,"Best Chicago street food. #1 Hot Dogs, Italian Beef & Sausage, and Cheese Beef Croissant. 1 of the best Pepper and Eggs sandwich served on Fridays during Lent.",1
1282,They serve a wide variety of food.,1
1283,Very loud. Constant announcing of order numbers is very annoying. They need a new system. All food was soggy. Poor service and rude staff. If you get water to drink they give you a tiny cup and you have to fight through the sea of people waiting for their food to get a refill. Place is very overrated.,0
1284,"I had the Beef combo with cheese and dipped in the hot broth, and a Vanilla milkshake. That was the bomb!!",1
1285,Food is great but the Employees are the worst of any Portillo's restaurant in the whole city. The restaurant can have a line going out the door and you'll see one employee working while 3 others are just standing around talking to each other. And the attitudes are extremely bad!!!!,0
1286,Best Italian beef in Chicago.,1
1287,"Great interior design, but the hot dogs were barely average",0
1288,"It looks like a total tourist spot. The chicago hot dog is nothing to brag about, but the prices are fair.  There was lots of seating available in the afternoon.",1
1289,"Always a must in Chi-town...best Chicago Beefs.  Chop salads are awesome.  For a chain restaurant, it's among the best.  Highly recommended if it's your first time to Chi-town",1
1290,Had the combo sandwich and it was so tasty but definitely not recommended for anyone with high cholesterol haha. The frozen custard was delicious as well.,1
1291,Great dogs and get cool interior.,1
1292,"Heckin good dog with a whole danged dill spear on top of it. Is this what a genuine Chicago dog is? Because I’ve had plenty things called “Chicago style” and it’s some flamboyantly sloppy mess of a thing, but at Portillos they were simple and pure and fantastic. You’re one cool dog, Portillos.",1
1293,Great food  awesome and fast service,1
1294,"Italian beef sandwich was delicious, but the restaurant as a whole is very confusing. There are multiple different lines you have to wait in to get your food, and everyone told us a different line to get in to buy beverages.",1
1295,Love their cheeseburgers and chili dogs,1
1296,"A must-visit if you're coming to Chicago. Different spots in the place order different sorts of food, so make sure you're walking towards the sign above you that shows the style you want. Also, try the cake shake; it's just worth it.",1
1297,Talk about a must see spot for any tourist. Their menu is massive and reasonably priced. They crank out the food at lightning speeds. Glad this place was on the list during our vacation.,1
1298,"Lots of options.  Hot beef sandwiches, chili and hot dogs,  even pasta dishes and full dinner salads. Everything was good and we would eat here again.  Only 4 stars because when it's busy it's hectic and unorganized if you don't understand how their lines work.",1
1299,"Italian beef, salads and hot dogs do not disappoint!! Taste of Chicago indeed 😋",1
1300,"You can always get a good Italian beef, a Chicago dog and a Maxwell St. polish which I had on National Hot Dog Day.  Consistently good food.",1
1301,One of the slowest portillos ever. Also the fries were so bad…normally theyre the best part!,1
1302,I liked the food and the theme is nice.,1
1303,I had a great experience there The food was fantastic and the service was excellent !!!,1
1304,I got the Italian beef sandwich. Best damn sandwich ever. I never review things but here I am telling the world how great this is. I will go back to Chicago for this sandwich,1
1305,"Finding parking nearby was brutal when I went, but the food more than made up for it!  Too bad we were just passing through.  Would be a regular here.",1
1306,The polish Hot dog it's mandatory. You should not go away without taste it.,1
1307,"Food was good, service was slow",1
1308,Food was very good ---- the restaurant was VERY busy but the staff was able to maintain and control the crowd. Definitely worth the wait. Food was hot and fresh. Clean faculty as well. Will definitely go back again!,1
1309,Better than the average fast food chain. The food is very tasty and can get a bit crowded on the weekends especially in the evenings.  Reasonably priced and nice atmosphere,1
1310,Best beef sandwich anywhere.,1
1311,No line at the drive through when I was there for lunch (somehow). Got an amazing Italian beef sandwich.,1
1312,"I have been to Portillo's many times.  Worst service ever.  45 minutes to get my food.  Staff unwilling to help.  Repeatedly was told it was coming soon.  When a manager finally looked for it, they could not find it.  So, the manager rushed to make it.  NO ONE EVER APOLOGIZED.   Extremely poor customer service.",0
1313,"EVERYTIME I visit home this is my first and last stop! Get off the airport, indulge. On my way home, stop, indulge and repeat. Very helpful, very clean and needless to say the make a mean Chicago Dog and Italian Beef!",1
1314,"We just loved the atmosphere, the food offerings... Easy order& pick up.  A do again.",1
1315,Food was off the charts. Best hot dog we’ve ever had.,1
1316,Gotta say it was a great hot dog. However having to wait for 25 munutes standing next to the pick up counter was not a good experience. You could improve the delivery method,1
1317,"As an out of towner, this place has delicious italian beef, nice to be able to get different sizes to suit your appetite and calories!  Sausage was just ok tho",1
1318,The best Italian beef in the city. Their chocolate cake and custard are also very good. Everything else is decent but not worth the hype.,1
1319,"We came here to get a classic Chicago dog, some Italian beef and something fried. All were delicious, the dipped sandwich was a decadent treat and the servings were generous!",1
1320,"Most people recommend Portillos for their hotdogs, but for me, their shakes and Italian beef are the best! ... Want to take it to the next level... Get the cake shake, toot can't go wrong with that!",1
1321,Check out the back room. The photo on the wall has a time traveler on the top right. Salad was fresh. The portillos famous hot dog was very good.,1
1322,"Portillos is a great classic ""Chicago Food"" restaurant, with great burgers, hot dogs, and fries, as well as a good beer list. Try their chocolate cake shake! It's the best.",1
1323,Can't go wrong with the Classic Hot Dog and Italian Beef. Also the cake shake its delicious!,1
1324,Maxwell street polish hotdog is so good!,1
1325,Anxiety inducing crowds on a Saturday morning.  The restaurant has devised an ordering system that guarantees no eye contact and made this customer feel like a cog in not very efficient machine.,1
1326,"Great Burger and a perfect Location....
A must when you're in Chicago...😎👍🏼",1
1327,"Amazing Food! Friendly and exciting workers! A little wait can be expected on busy nights but worth every second.

Get the charbroiled bacon cheeseburger 😍",1
1328,This place has the best beef and cheddar croissants! I love coming here the atmosphere the food. Yes the food can be pricey but it is sooo worth it  come here every two weeks as I try and watch my diet but I cant help it.,1
1329,This place has the best chocolate cake and custard,1
1330,Best hot dogs in the world! This is my first stop anytime I come to Chicago. Chocolate cake shake - get one!,1
1331,"Love this place. I just can't not love it. Fries awesome. Cake delicious. Hot dogs, chicago style, my style. Chopped Salad. Everything is delicious. And the staff is delightful!",1
1332,"So we came for the italian beef sandwiches, as one does in Chicago. We ended up coming back for more, especially the caesar salad! Who knew the best caesar salad of my life would be from Portillo's. I would have eaten every meal on my trip at Portillo's if my family agreed.",1
1333,"If come on a weekend, get ready to stamd in line! Love their Big Beef dipped!",1
1334,"We asked a friend for a recommendation of where to eat while passing through Chicago and this was the immediate response.

Hands down best sandwich we've ever had.",1
1335,Such a unique restaurant experience with an outdoor market feel.  The Portillo's dog was easily the best thing I ate while visiting Chicago.,1
1336,"So Yummy! Tons of variety, excellent food. The Cajan chicken pita was great, and their chocolate cake is worth all of the calories.",1
1337,"I don't really like the hot dogs there but if you have a cake shake, man those are killer I love them so much but I wish they had more heath choice for shakes",0
1338,The Italian beef sandwich with hot peepers and wet. So huge and so good. The chop salad was delicious as also huge. My friend and I split it and barely touched the salad.,1
1339,"Every time I come here my food takes a very long time, much longer than a normal fast food place, and something is always wrong with my order. It’s probably one of the busiest locations but they really should find a better process to accommodate.",0
1340,"Worst experience ever at a Portillos, over 25 mins to get our order, horrible service then went to get ice cream another 15 min with 2 people in line.  Aweful!  Staff was crabby and not helpful except for the nice lady helping clean tables upstairs. This was not what we expected from Downtown Chicago",0
1341,"I waited on my order for about 30 minutes! They were really busy, so I didn’t complain ! One of the employees realized I was waiting longer than usual . So she checked on my order ! Apparently someone else got it ! Well they remade my order took another 10 min .... I finally sat down to eat and my order was not right ! I went back and let them know ! Waited another 15 min ... still nothing ! So I just asked for a refund !",0
1342,Over-rated dogs. The buns here are always soggy and everything falls apart. Gives tourists the wrong impression. Cake shake was good tho!,1
1343,The best Italian beef sandwich on earth,1
1344,"Always enjoy stopping by Portillos, but the downside is that their queue for getting your food can get pretty long and congested. Friend of mine literally ordered a jumbo dog and he never had his number called",1
1345,Dude this place and all the locations I've visited are legendary. The only problem is I live in Tennessee and we don't have em here! Portillo's if you are listening please open a location in Nashville!!!,1
1346,"Too LOUD!! Chaotic! Order at one station, salads/ drinks pick up at another station and sandwiches at yet a third!! Long lines confusion at the order counters and who goes where - to order. I wouldn't visit it again. Even though the food was tasty....service was nonexistent, unfriendly and too raucous of an environment !",1
1347,Portillo's was one of THE cleanest and friendliest hot dog places  I've ever been.  They have a variety of other food besides hot dogs and a great atmosphere!,1
1348,"Food is good, but not great. Although it gets crowded they do a good job getting your order fast. I think it's a bit expensive for hamburgers and hot dogs though, and no meal combos.",1
1349,I spent 13 minutes on the phone with a lady at this location she had a hard time spelling Rose in the city name Roseville.  Both times the customer service over the phone was disappointing.  I would pay 30% more to communicate with someone that had some sort of intelligence.,0
1350,Italian beef is the ICON of Chicago I feel like we had THE WORST sandwich at Portillos their meat has absolutely NO FLAVOR. Unfortunately we walked a block away and stumbled upon Al's beef and regretted stopping at Portillos :(,0
1351,"Visiting from Michigan, my new favorite restaurant in Chicago. Food was the BOMB, atmosphere was amazing. Pretty clean place for some many people walking in and out.",1
1352,". I would give them a zero if possible, but unfortunately u can't. I order here about once a week and today I called in a order at 10:33 and they hung up on me so I called again at 10:34. once I got to the restaurant at 11:12 the security (whom was very rude) open the door and told me that they were close. Adam the store manager told me they threw away my food without any notification, no one told me what time they vlose, what time I had to be there or called me to let me know they were holding my food. I was extremely disappointed and I got the young lady who took my order Tamia who did not inform me about the time they close .",0
1353,"Italian beef sandwich and strawberry milk shake. Match made in heaven.

All items are pretty much good. But beware of huge crowds on weekends and special occasions.",1
1354,"Best Chicago style hot dogs in the city! Really nastalgic, cafeteria style set up with pasta and the best Vienna beef in town!",1
1355,Hot dogs were severely overrated.  Ordered online and the pick up area was an unorganized mess.  The hot dog was packaged sloppy and the bun was soggy.,1
1356,"From Detroit, love Coneys, but had to try a Chicago Hot Dog in Chicago. It was pretty good. I'm very happy to have tried it. Ladies, there are hot peppers on it!!!",1
1357,Fabulous place. Food was amazing. Ate there three times when visiting.,1
1358,"Chicago staple. Literally one of the main things I would miss about Chicago if I moved away. There is nothing more to say than this: chocolate cake shake, beef and cheddar croissant, hot peppers, cheese fries, and chopped salad. These are a few of my favorite things... cue The Sound of Music. Seriously though if you've never been to Portillo's, it is a MUST DO in Chicago.",1
1359,Chicago Dog was OK but the Italian Beef with hot peppers was delicious.,1
1360,Went to Portillo’s on family suggestion. Well checked off my Chicago bucket list to do. Definitely not worth coming back. Stick with my NY street dogs anytime!,0
1361,Food is amazing but this place has to figure out how to get customers through faster. Today it was a 1-1.5 hour wait to get your food. They did not tell customers that when they order.,0
1362,"Visiting Chicago from Apopka, Florida and ate at Portillo's for the first time and ordered an Italian Beef sandwich and Polish Sausage. The food was Great, and will be back.",1
1363,Deep dip grill beef is a must try!,1
1364,Sure the food is great but the wait in the drive-thru was nearly 30 minutes tonight??? We carry out several times a month and the wait has gotten progressively worse in the past year...just can't do this anymore...,0
1365,"Yo, CHRIS, IS THE BEST EMPLOYEE THERE! I came by with my family and i ordered a BACON cheeseburger. I take a bite and no bacon. I take it back and chris goes above and beyond to correct my order. He was polite, accurate and professional. Thanks. CHRIS! 👍🏼
P.S Five Stars are for chris ,not portillos.",1
1366,If you are from out of town and pass in this place you are a fool. Their Italian Beef beats out any deep dish pizza you can find in the city. Not to mention they have a shake made from chocolate cake.,1
1367,"I am a delivery driver. I went in to pick up a order for a customer. After waiting in for about 15 min I just asked is the order for customer name ready? she replied to me learn English if you stay in America. Just because I am a food delivery driver I was treated such a way I buy so much food them I never got treated like that when I am a paying customer but if I am picking up a order for someone else and I am a legal immigrant to this country I have been ask to learn English. I have already posted a complain online for which I got a call stating that they will do the investigation upon this matter and will reach back to me. Its been more than a week now and now I am bringing this matter in social media. Being such a big franchise, you should train your employee how to treat your customer/drivers. No job is small/big. Learn to respect and train your employees to respect. I can do a whole lot worse than this by reaching out to your customers at your store about the behavior if I don’t get a reply on immediate basis. I just wanted a written apology from you guys. As stated in my previous complaint.

100 w ontario chicago",0
1368,"Chicago favorite! Satisfies every crave! Beefs, Dogg's, burgers and cake?!?! Inside looks dope but I prefer the drive thru! Simple, fast and delicious!!",1
1369,If you're looking for a really good hot dog experience in Chicago this is the place to go to. Also the onion rings were good as well.,1
1370,Their roast beef is the best!  Get the chocolate cake as well.  I always buy a full cake to take home to my family in Canada!!,1
1371,"First time in Chicago and this place was amazing! Food was fantastic, service was great and to top it all off the chocolate cake had me drooling for more! Would recommend!!",1
1372,"I ordered through Doordash for a whole chocolate cake and when I was eating it I found a piece of glass on the cake. I called them to share my complain and they hung up on me. I have called two more times and now answer, horrible customer service.",0
1373,"Everything at Portillos is quite delicious, but don't anything healthy from here. I would give 5 stars, but when I was there my soda was regular when I clearly asked for diet multiple times!!! Portillos almost caused me a medical emergency due to high blood sugar (I am Type 1 Diabetic). Hope to visit again soon, but I will be mich more wary when eating here next time!",1
1374,Really neat environment. Retro Chicago with interesting memorabilia. Organized chaos at the pickup line. Staff seems to handle the onslaught well. Dogs not bad.,1
1375,The best beef hot dog will be my go to spots while in Chicago for Chicago style hot dogs,1
1376,I'm pretty grossed out by the expose on the news uncovering the bug problem and showing the video of the creepy crawlers scurrying around the shake machine and the prep area... I will never go back to this location. The upsetting part is that I had actually eaten there that same night the expose came on the news... I'm appalled. They should just tear the place down and rebuild it.,0
1377,The shake definitely stole the show,1
1378,"Nice authentic American food court.
Hotdogs are not bad, but I've expected more.
Try salad with strawberry, nuts and chicken -- it is really good.",1
1379,"Just order, and then add cheese fries.  You won't regret it...unless you missed the combo or at least 1 Chicago style dog.. best if you start with all three",1
1380,Italian Beef Sandwich was the greatest thing I've ever eaten. A must try if you are in Chicago and wanting a quick delicious lunch.,1
1381,Good hot dog and nice place,1
1382,Pretty empty but i like getting my food quickly and if you haven't gotten a cake shake you need to start the new year with one🤤,1
1383,"I really like the food, the energy of the place too, it’s crazy that place.  I like the food, how everything works, and the speed of service, the decoration doesn't even have to be too much, and the options are many.  I will be back many, many times!",1
1384,It was opened but they said it was closing so the bulldog at the door was kicking out everyone. So Google check the opening times or Portillos make up your mind. We went to McDonald across the road that is probably the same quality,0
1385,Best hot food ever!,1
1386,"Great atmosphere, great shakes.",1
1387,Eat here every time i visit Chicago. The lay out of this place causes confusion. Could be more efficient an quicker service. Great food. Great value.,1
1388,"You can't go wrong with Portillos. Hot dogs, Italian Beef, good salads, its a good place for quick food.  This location draws a lot of tourists, so its good if you want someone to experience a ""Chicago Style Hot Dog"" - but its also good for locals who need to drive thru- late.  :) Love portillos!",1
1389,"For my kitchen countertops, I couldn’t decide between quartz and granite. The contractors helped a lot with the decision process. Ultimately I chose the granite countertops for their accessibility ad durability.
Having kids, the decision to have low maintenance granite countertops was the deciding factor. This company did a great job on the installation and it was quick and efficient.",1
1390,"I think it is one of those things you have to do.  The food is good but the process isn't as organized as I would like.  Order in one line after waiting, then wait to get your food then yet another wait to get drink.  it was lesd than 10 minutes but just wasn't clear on what to do and where to go.",1
1391,Incredible food if u want fast food that is not the traditional fast food. Has the traditional fast food staples but you can also find a healthy alternative. Not a chocolate fan but their chocolate cake is like grandmas chocolate cake.,1
1392,Great hot dogs. Must show covid card in order to dine in.,1
1393,Best hot dogs in Chicago,1
1394,Best hotdog I've ever had! Felt like a family first restaurant with good food. So easy to relax and enjoy good company here.,1
1395,"Portillo's has all of Chicago's iconic foods and every bit of it is awesome!  Hotdogs, shakes and beef sandwich's are some of the best around!!",1
1396,"Service is ok, food is tasty, but this is the second time they overcharged me at the one downtown Chicago on clark. The manager didn't even have the decency to act concern. Warning make sure to check your receipt.",0
1397,The food was very good. Walked across the street immediately after eating inside to Target for tops 15 minutes and our vehicle was towed (cost us $200+) Which would not happen if this establishment did not allow it to happen.,0
1398,"It was terrible, they didn't even get my order right and they charged for what I didn't get.  Ordered chocolate cake for my son's birthday and didn't get it paid for it.  Order a cheese fries no cheese but I paid for it.  Very disappointed go there a lot not anymore",0
1399,"Lived in Chicago all my life, and Portillos still has some of the best dogs. I always end up getting the Chicken Diavolo pasta dish though. So so good!",1
1400,"Portillo's and Barnellis pasta is America's favorite fast food joint. From burgers to hot dogs, to salads and pasta, there's something for everyone. I love the ""big beef"" italian beef dipped in au jus. Their cheese fries are excellent and you can't go wrong with the chocolate cake, or shakes or combine the two for the ultimate treat, a chocolate cake shake!",1
1401,Portillos river North Chicago downtown Illinois is one of the best restaurant you can order and stay in the resturent with family and friendly atmosphere the cashiers are excellent and the the people who prepare the food work very hard more than one or two shifts and the people who deliver the food are awesome 👍 👌 😁 the food menu is sooooo good for afternoon and evening I didn't try the morning shift I tell you the truth 😉 I always order sandwiches like Italian beef with sweat peaper it is energy bulit and also chicken caprise it is a mixture of many tastes and also oh my goodness gyros with extra tomato and onions ..... I will tell you more about pastas and salads next review,1
1402,The food here is excellent. However this particular location seems to be plagued recently by a current spate of thieves. My friend had her purse stolen a couple of weeks ago from this establishment. Management here was very prompt in handling the issue,1
1403,"Oh my goodness, great food! That Italian beef sandwich and Chicago style hotdogs were the best ever.",1
1404,It was amazin the bread was so soft it felt as if it melted in your mouth,1
1405,The Italian beef and Portillo dog was awesome! This was definitely one of the best spots we ate at while visiting Chicago.,1
1406,"Delicious! Service was very unorganized though. Someone cut me and took my cake shake, so I was upset. The whole meal should have been given to me at one time to avoid confusion.",1
1407,"An utterly disappointing Portillo’s. It’s absolutely packed to the brim, mostly with tourists, and my Italian Beef was poorly constructed and dipped into oblivion. You’re much better off going to the Al’s Beef on Wabash in the Loop.",0
1408,If you don't like soggy bread do not get your sandwich you dipped. The selection was cool. The staff was fun and the smoothies were awesome.,1
1409,The Italian beef was awesome. Chili dog was ok. I wish it didn't have beans but good none the less,1
1410,Fast service. Great hot dog,1
1411,Horrible Experience! Accused me of stealing a drink when I clearly ordered it and the cashier forgot to add it. Then the employee started yelling at me and giving me this attitude. Plus I asked for barbecue sauce and they forgot it.,0
1412,"Staff was not very organized and took a long time to get our food even though they were not busy. Once we got it, it was very good! Cake shake is a must",1
1413,"I guess you gotta come here and get a dog if you're visiting Chicago. The hot dog was good, but not out of this world. It's a very casual place and affordable so I can see the appeal.",1
1414,Best fat kid food in the world. Good bless America! You'll never forget your meal.,1
1415,"Must do when in Chicago! I am a plain dog eater, but my boyfriend convince me that when in Chicago, you must eat the hot dog their way. And no joke...it was incredible! #noregrets",1
1416,"Just don't go there, I had ordered for Italian beef, Waited 20 mnts in drive through while only 3 cars ahead of me. Drive through Mike and speakers were not working properly.",0
1417,"Great atmosphere, great variety of excellent food, fair prices.",1
1418,"Best food spot in downtown Chicago, I mean they have everything you could want here!",1
1419,Italian beef combo.  Meh.  The sausage was good but the beef was pretty tasteless.,1
1420,Fantastic Chicago dogs! The chocolate cake can't be beat! Italian beef is outstanding and make sure to get the bun dunked for a true Chicago experience.,1
1421,"Absolutely the worst portillos I have ever had to deal with.  They forgot an item when we ordered for delivery, and when we called them they put us on hold for 20+ mins.  We had to call back 3 times, and they hung up on us.  The lady was exceptionally rude.",0
1422,"Very good. I actually had a soup as well which was even nicer. I wonder if it's named after Michael Portillo, a famous English aristocrat, travel aficionado and financier.",1
1423,Portillo's is a great place to go for late night eating or for a meal with a group of people. It usually ends up being one of my go to places to take out of town guests as there are options for all people. Make sure to save room for the chocolate cake:),1
1424,"The quality service was awful,  the wait was insane and the bread with the salad was from like 1956 it was a brick.  I wouldn't recommend going inside drive thru my order was like 71 by the time I got my order 93 got theirs before me",0
1425,So good!!,1
1426,"Portillo's was my first stop of eating everything Chicago tour. I yelped for chicago style hotdog around me and Portillo came out top with lots of reviews. It turns out  SoCal also has Portillo's but that didn't stop me from having that first bite of that hotdog. I actually liked it a lot. Unfortunately, I do not have very many experience in Chicago style hog dogs to compare with but I enjoy it very much. In fact, I may go visit Portillo's nearby and enjoy other good food there.",1
1427,"Here you can find the famous hot dog from Chicago ,but also you can get burguers and the french fries with cheese on it.. yummy.. if you are vegeterian you can also get a good salad... the place has a really stuff around it. ,so you can enjoy watching it..  you will always find spoot in it,..",1
1428,"The river north portfolios charges for large fries but mostly give you a small in large cup, won't be going there anymore. Happened way to many times I can get ripped off somewhere else",0
1429,"Awesome place to stop and grab a bite to eat.  I personally cant resist the combo (Italian beef/ Italian sausage) with hot peppers, but anything you choose on this menu wont disappoint you.",1
1430,Food and service was great. We timed it just right there was no line and found a table right away. Loved all the historical items in here. I wish they sold souvenirs in the store rather than just online.,1
1431,"I am PISSED, I just spent $22.00 and you should see what I was sold.....utterly ridiculous! I went through drive thru and got home got COMFORTABLE and opened my Italian Beef Combo w/ Sweet and Hot Peppers (Me) and Plain Italian Beef for my Son and on my sandwich I got an oh that's not supposed to be a combo with sweet and hot peppers cause I got a slither of beef on it and one jalapeno pepper and one slither of sweet pepper and my Son's sandwich barely had beef on it and I have been on hold for an hour now. Iam so PISSED. Portillo's gets entirely too much business to serving this type of food and they s/b ashamed of THEMSELVES, I just want my money back and  NO MORE PORTILLO'S FOR ME. I AM STILL HOLDING FOR A MANAGER.",0
1432,"This is a must for a tourist. It is basically a Chicago institution. They have a passable Italian beef, but their vegetarian options are very limited, which is important since my wife is vegetarian.",1
1433,"Great Italian beef. Lines can be long, but worth the wait. Have your order ready. Adult beverages are a separate line.",1
1434,"This is an amazingly busy Place, full of activity, noisy, standing in line not only to order but also to pick up your food but overall this is actually a good experience, not a bad experience. Definitely a place I will go again",1
1435,Pretty underwhelming,0
1436,Can't go wrong with anything on their menu..prepared to order and fairly quickly even during rush hours. love their Chicago hot dog!,1
1437,Best italian beef in town.,1
1438,The beef is unlike anything ever tasted!! Fast service and great food.,1
1439,Get the infamous Chicago dog here. The chocolate cake and custard are amazing as well. The atmosphere here is fun and unique and prices are quite reasonable.,1
1440,Fun atmosphere. Friendly people. Yummy food. Chicago dog and their famous chocolate cake. So good. Chocolate shake too. Mmm...,1
1441,"Delicious burgers, hot dogs, pastas and who can forget desserts? I ordered the cheese fries with a Bacon Cheeseburger and strawberry shake when I went to visit for the first time 👌 Very good and fast service",1
1442,"I saw the video of the infestation and Im really disappointed, to say the least. Ive spent a nice penny per visit and can't believe what Ive saw. Still has the greatest Italian beefs, but gross is gross. Sooo disappointed Portillos.☹",1
1443,"While in Chicago, we had to get a ""Chicago Dog"" - this was recommended by our hotel and was within walking distance.  Excellent dog!! and another one checked off the Bucket List!",1
1444,I liked everything about lunch.  My son and I enjoyed it.  The way three lines to order fed to two cash registers didn't work so well.,1
1445,"Delicious! I wasn't even hungry but the food was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating. I had a wonderful experience eating their A1 food.",1
1446,A MUST when in Chicago. The best location at that.,1
1447,An authentic place to go for a tasty Chicago style dog. The line up was quite long but moved very quickly. Friendly and welcoming staff.,1
1448,"Great food, great place to get that Chicago dog...",1
1449,"Great new favorite, prepare to wait, but we'll worth it..I'm hooked on Chicago dogs now",1
1450,"There's nothing quite like a portillo's hot dog.  I love their selection of hot beef, salads and tamales.  My personal favorite food there is the cheezy beefy crossiant.  It is sooo gooey and delicious.  It's one of the reasons I moved to chicago from the bay area actually!",1
1451,"I think they have the best Italian beef in Chicago but I admittedly haven't tried them all. You have to get it dipped though, it is the only way to have it in my opinion.",1
1452,"The service was okay…I didn’t get the correct chicken sandwich I wanted it though and it seemed as if staff was rushing the line, which is why my order came out to be incorrect.",1
1453,Had an intense experience in this insanely popular spot. Come prepared to line up and jostle for position at the pick window. Full contact Chicago hot dog experience.,1
1454,Best fast food in Chicago.,1
1455,"The food is pretty good but we ordered four items when I was there and two of them took more than 20 minutes to be ready, during which time we had to stand around in the incredible noise.",1
1456,"Best hot dogs in the world!!! Chicago should be famous for those ,not pizza ..... Chico's pizza in moses lake ,wa. Is known for the best pizza!",1
1457,"Slow and unorganized carry out process. Got order wrong. Missing items.  Was told curbside pickup when I called and when I got there,  there is no curbside, only walk in pick up.",0
1458,"Meh....anticlimactic...a bit confusing having to figure out where to order and having to pick up food from different locations and a beer at another spot, then finding condiments and something to eat with...was rather frustrating and exhausting by the time you get to try and find a clean table to eat at... I can say I experienced it, but wouldn't be interested in going back.",1
1459,"Hot dogs are bomb, chocolate shake and fries to die for!!! But wasn’t impressed by the beef sandwiches.",1
1460,"Had a chance to visit this Iconic Hot Dog Establishment but it is way more then just hot dogs. They have a pretty wide variety of food items to select from. We were in search of a Chicago Hot Dog and decided on coming here.
Glad we did. The food was freshly made and had a great taste.
We ordered a Portillo’s Beef Hot Dog (Reg Size) with all the toppings along with a Maxwell Street Polish. Both had great flavor and did not disappoint. I also ordered a small fries along with a Garden Salad. The side Salad is pretty large and is served with a pretty large piece of Ciabatta Bread. My daughter and son-in-law split a Beef Hot Dog and an Italian Beef Sandwich. She said it was really tasty. If you want a good quick meal visit Portillo’s!!",1
1461,"I really liked this place. There are really long lines, but very quick. I was waiting on the order for a couple of minutes, but hotdogs only. Those were ready before I ordered a beer :) also, they serve a beer in an ice-cold glass! Awesome! A lot of space, 2 floors, easy to find a table. Definitely recommend if you never tried Chicago-style hot dog 🌭!",1
1462,"The seasonal salted caramel shake was delicious! The hot dog was something I have never experienced with all the different veggies and specialty peppers. The hot dog itself did not seem to have you to have a lot of flavor but all the toppings made up for it. The sandwich was a little dry however they did have a gravy option maybe that's where we went wrong in ordering it dry but the meat was tender. Bathrooms were clean, employees constantly walking around keeping the tables clean.",1
1463,"This is one of those places you are told to go to while in Chicago.  The food was great.  The hot Italian beef sandwich, hot dogs and chocolate cake are all amazing.  The line was pretty long for around 3 in the afternoon, but that is expected.  The main reason that I gave them four stars is the state of the bathrooms and general lack of cleaning.  They had a few employees walking around to clean, but they obviously needed more.  I am hoping that this was just a one off situation.  Overall, I would go back, since the food was very good.",1
1464,"The chocolate cake was my absolute favorite dessert of all time. It was so moist and not too sweet on the frosting. Absolutely divine!!! The hotdog was also excellent, I wish the peppers were a little more spicy but they had a kick. The restaurant itself was very cozy, lots of seating and things to look at. The staff could be a little bit more friendlier but what else do you expect from Chicago.",1
1465,"Very popular, casual, neighborhood restaurant on N Clark & W Ontario. You can walk in, place your order and pick it up within minutes.  I was surprised  by the spacious food court feel when I walked in.  But way cooler.  Service was quick and we enjoyed our first classic Chicago style beef hot dogs. It hit the spot. We had a side of onion rings too.",1
1466,"One of the best hot dogs I have ever had! Beef sandwich, even with extra gravy was a bit dry but also pretty good. Atmosphere was awesome! The shakes are to die for!",1
1467,"Food was great, truly a taste  of Chicago. The ambience of the restaurant captured the old style Chicago. Toilets weren't the best. While we were about to eat and we needed to combine 2 tables because we were 7 in total. We wanted to enjoy our meal and experience as a family. Until this service lady came to us and told us to rearrange back the tables after we ate. Paying customers rearranging back tables? It was past lunch and there was not enough customers to make her job busy. But NO she had to come to us and make us feel uncomfortable. Like she was the one paying for our meal. She was rude and management should look unto this kind of customer service. 2 stars for the bad and rude customer service!",0
1468,"Cool building, large eat-in cafeteria style. Wait in line, order food, wait for food and sit. It was a pretty long wait, even one of the employees behind the counter agreed. We also got the popular cake shakes, they tasted like they sound...crumbled up cake in a shake. Nothing to rave about but not bad either. I got the Baked Mostaccioli and it was delicious! Another in my party got the Italian Beef Sandwich and wasn't impressed. Not terrible, but not great either.  I'd go again, but not sure why all the hype.",1
1469,"Came to this place cause it’s pretty famous according to other reviews, although I have seen a few things that made me feel I should say that if you visit this place, it should be for the sandwiches or hot dogs; the salad ingredients did not look fresh and one of the workers was leaning in the food counter facing her co-worker and shaking her hair on the food, she had gloves on but was not practicing the cross contamination process, hopefully she gets better training. Usually I don’t like to complain about things like this but seeing this really bugged me, I hope no-one gets sick cause it’s a very busy restaurant… now on the good side of the story the steak sandwich was not disappointing, if you like juicy sandwiches order it with the gravy. I wish I could give it the 5 star rating but I deducted one because of the salad bar.",1
1470,"First day in Chicago & I was referred to Portillo's. I was hungry & it was close by so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the regular Italian beef, with extra gravy, & the Greek salad. I was expecting the Italian beef to be juicy, bcuz I asked for extra gravy, but it was super dry. The only thing wet was the bread, which was soggy. The Italian beef was so dry I had to take a sip of water after the first 2 bites. I eventually added salad dressing to each bite to get the rest of it down. I would NOT order it again! The salad was pretty decent, much better than the Italian beef!",0
1471,"Both times we went during our recent trip to Chicago, the wait for food was every bit of 20+ minutes. The staff was not rude, but also not friendly, with the exception of the manager that walked by to warn me not to hang my purse on the back of the because they've had a high number of purse snatchings in the restaurant recently.

Restaurant was a wreck both days we went and the bathrooms were filthy. Food was good. During our 2 visits we ordered the following:
Chicago dogs, chili cheese dog, Char-Grilled Maxwell Street Polish Sausage, Italian beefs, fettuccine Alfredo, French fries, milkshakes, and chocolate cake. The Char-Grilled Maxwell Street Polish Sausage was by far the best thing we ordered. Everything else was good, but nothing special.",1
1472,"Not 5 stars because they call your order number using the microphone, so while your are eating you continuosly hear numbers. On Sunday for lunch there was a long queue for both orders and pick-up.
Hot dog and Italian beef sandwich were excellent. Price is also good.",1
1473,"Hot dogs are great!
Beef sandwich is ok...maybe just not my thing.
Chocolate cake is amazing for price...super moist!
Strawberry shortcake also amazing for the price..we real strawberries and tons of strawberry flavor!
Their dessert items were shockingly good for the price...would go back just for that!
The only 1 star off was BC of the crazy wait ...for order to pickup was 45min on a Thurs evening at 5:45pm.
Best advice is go earlier or later",1
1474,Loved the food here!  I don’t think my wife and I were expecting the food and atmosphere to be as enjoyable as we found it to be.  Loved the old time historical decor and the staff was fun and pleasant.  The hot dogs were excellent and my wife enjoyed the onion rings.  We shared a chocolate cake shake and it was really good!  We might stop by Portillo’s on our way to the airport today before our trip home!,1
1475,"We went here three times in a span of three days. Overall it was really good and had good value, but sometimes it wasn’t as good as the other.

Pro tip to order-get the cake! Get the shaved beef with cheese in the crossing
This place also always seems to be very busy so order ahead or know it will take a while!

Food-good food and classic Chicago. Super extensive menu which should cater to a wide audience
Staff-friendly and can help you out! They always seem very efficient",1
1476,Always excellent food when I treat Myself to Portillo's. The Beef and Cheddar Croissant is Amazing! Try it with a French Fry and drink and will not be disappointed. Also if You are interested in cake? Try the Chocolate cake Milk Shake. It's one of the best things You will ever eat in Your life! Nothing but praise for Portillo's.,1
1477,"Loved it! The best hot dogs EVER!!!! IF IN CHICAGO, THIS IS A ""GOT TO""!!!!! I always wanted to eat a Chicago-style hot dog. This is the place to stuff your face. Classy, historic, ambiance, and great set up.",1
1478,"The polish sausage was probably the best thing we ate… ribs were average with a nice sweet sauce, hotdog didn’t have anything distinguishing.  Italian sausage a decent spice kick and I’d order that again. Overall it was “fine”.",1
1479,Staple and tastes like a staple - amazing hot dogs! The famous Italian beef sandwich wis a gem too. It’s a fast food style place and could be a bit cleaner but apart from that super!,1
1480,"When you walk in you can tell this place is full of history and your gonna get a taste of it. The line was long but moved fast.The Chicago dog here is amazing, it’s got the poppy seed potato bun, Fresh crunchy pickles peppers and the dog is on point! It’s amazing. The thing to get is the Italian beef with the gravy and peppers this sandwich will make you feel taste bud euphoria. The meat melts in your mouth with the gravy omg so damn good. I got both and was so stuffed but it’s worth the heart burn, there’s a cvs close by get some tums.",1
1481,"Neat pllace to visit with decently good food and atmosphere. The food can be a bit heavy (burgers, hot dogs, cheese steaks) but they also have other fare such as pasta and salads. The food was tasty nonetheless.

Only 3 stars because the staff, when we visited were cold, if not less than friendly. For example, when I asked for a drink refill, the girl manning the station acted very annoyed, I couldn't understand what she was saying, and she was just waving her hand at me. After I left, the person behind me was trying to get a refill as well and she knew he was there, but she clearly ignored him until he made it a point to get her attention. Maybe that's just how people are in Chicago?

Still worth visiting and giving it a try regardless. Maybe the staff when we visited we're just having a bad day.",1
1482,"Love it! A must see if you are visiting. Classic Chicago style eats in a fast casual environment. Serving Italian beef, polish sausage and even chicken fingers for the kids. Portillo's has a pretty good sized menu with pasta and salad options, dessert a few beers on tap, served in a frozen goblet. I highly recommend for a quick inexpensive, tasty meal.",1
1483,"I would put 6 stars if possible. This place is amazing! Massive establishment, great atmosphere, and most of all tasty food and drinks. They have signature Hot Dogs and Italian Beef Sammies. Huge servings of Beer on tap with awesome chancellor cups. I was in Chicago for fours days... I ate at Portillos 4 times. Will come back here every time",1
1484,"Yum! When in Chicago, ya gotta get a dog right? We asked some locals for their recommendations and got pointed in the direction of Portillo's. The line was bonkers so we ordered online and ended up getting our order a bit faster that way than standing in line (even though they didn't bring each to go order out individually - they waited until they had 5-6 orders bagged and ready then came to the counter to hand them out. Maybe more efficient for them, but a little annoying to wait for a batch of orders rather than just our own.) We had a big meal planned later in the day so we just got a Chicago dog apiece and some fries to share. The fries container wasn't filled well so it felt like we got fewer fries than we should have, but they were hot, crispy, salty and tasty. The Chicago dog was SO good though! The hot dog itself was delicious and the fixings made it just right. I loved the sport pepper! Not only was the food we tried really good, but the decor and music and feel of the whole place was very cool and nostalgic. Great experience!",1
1485,"A Chicago icon. Very busy place! Chaotic. Can be confusing and intimidating at first; but once you figure out the order process and pickup location, it’s pretty easy.

Ample food selection with Chicago classics. Very reasonably priced items. Chicago Dog and beef sandwich are must try’s for any tourists.

Ample seating on the second floor. Table turnover is quick.

Great place for family with kids. A must try when visiting Chicago.",1
1486,"Came here for lunch and it was surprisingly good. It does get busy but the lines are quick, just make sure you know what you want before you get to the cashier.

I ordered a jumbo hot dog with pickle, onion and ketchup. Standard hot dog, would get it again!",1
1487,"The hot dog was yummy. Not the best I've ever had, but worth the venture out to complete your Chicago must do list. The atmosphere was really cool. Definitely ask for Giradinera sauce.",1
1488,Fabulous! I had the Italian beef sandwich and a Chicago dog. Both were delicious. I will be back often.  Expect a line at lunch. Around 20 people in line but it moves quickly.,1
1489,"Portillo is a fast food joint that does not feel like one. We ordered a basic hot dog, Italian beef, and fish sandwich. Everything was great and not super salty. We loved the restaurant atmosphere and the service we got! It was our first meal in Chicago.",1
1490,"Loved it! Gets crowded some time and messy. Loved the hot dogs, not so much the beef and sausage sandwich. Chocolate eclair cake was also good. Reasonable prices.",1
1491,"Great and friendly staff!

Food was good and hit the spot after a long day checking out the views Chicago has to offer. Way better treat than McDonald's or any other fast food joint around.",1
1492,"I was very excited to stop at Portillo’s on my trip to Chicago with rave reviews from many friends and acquaintances. However my experience did not live up to the hype. The classic hot dog was good, but nothing crazy, and the fish sandwich was similarly fine (which we ordered because they were out of the veggie dog). The real disappointments were the Famous Chocolate Cake and the Chocolate Cake Shake. The chocolate icing in both was sickly sweet to me and had a weird chocolate taste that did not agree with my stomach. That’s not to say there was anything wrong with it but, for me, this taste did not hit the spot and I will be skipping out on this meal during future visits.",0
1493,THE BEST HOTDOG EVER YUM YUMMY. Sorry Chicago I hate mustard on my hotdog. It’s a thing here they don’t like ketchup on their dogs. Honestly I love it. Beautiful historic pieces inside. It’s like walking into a history museum. Love from NC.,1
1494,"Good experience! The restaurant is really nice, have two floors and tables outside. A lot of people at lunch time but they are fast in the service, the food is good for the price (is fast food), I would recommend the beef sandwich!",1
1495,"Their polish is still one of the best. Recommended over even their hot dogs.

Always good, but their customer service has been dodgy lately. My last visit, I ordered a big beef- they rang in a regular. After I waited on line to correct the order, I eventually got my… regular beef. I think they just gave me the original order, which isn’t a plus. Still good food.",1
1496,"The atmosphere was amazing because the art was so cool. The line was long but quick to move and we also got our food pretty quickly. The hotdog itself was OK. It seemed a little undercooked, and the flavor was just OK. It could be personal preference.",1
1497,Enjoyed the hotdog which was fantastic but the Italian beef was just ok. Even dipped in the au jus the flavor profile was just flat. The gardiniera/hot peppers were average and the sweet pepper completely disappointed. Very one-dimensional flavor.,1
1498,"Wow!  A nice place to see, nice ambiance.  I love the way you they did it, nice decor, you can see in the kitchens, well organized.  Moreover, the hot-dogs are VERY tasty, highly recommended !",1
1499,"Ordered online and was told 10 mins to pickup. It took about 50 mins. Only one person was working the pickup counter and also had to prepare drinks for all the takeout orders. They didn't utilize the shelves at all or the microphone, instead keeping bags behind the counter and calling names about every 10 mins. The original hot dog was on such a soggy bun. The polish sausage was burned.",0
1500,"Service was fast and friendly. Definitely a must have if you want a quick meal while you're in chicago. I love the Chili it's my favorite item on the menu. The shakes are pretty good, I've definitely had better but this specific location did mix my two shakes up when I had ordered some. I ordered a lemon cake shake and a strawberry shake. I was in the drive-thru when this happened and as a busy body I didn't have time to check my order completely, so I took a sip of my lemon cake shake, and boom there were strawberries in it. The other shake I was given was a vanilla. They had mixed together my lemon and strawberries :/. Not the best experience I've had there. I wouldn't say this happens often but it's more than likely you'll get something messed up on your order the next time you go especially through the drive thru where most people don't even have time to turn back around and have it corrected.",1
1501,"Chicago dogs were good, but there are better places. The lines are super long, so I recommend ordering online pickup. Crinkle fries were pretty bland.",1
1502,"Great place to get your Chicago staples: Hot dogs & Italian beef sandwiches. In between a take out/fast food joint and a restaurant.
Lots of original Chicago memorabilia on the walls. Fun atmosphere. Not a proper restaurant but enough tables to eat your ordered food. Wide selection of food and drinks.",1
1503,"I was so excited to try this place because it's so well known and a to do in chicago.  However I wasn't impressed.  It's a hot dog. And for us, a very soggy cold one.  They forgot to call out order or son because we waited over 25 min for 2 Chicago dogs and one fry. Even one of the bus boys said to come back. They were short staffed so they were behind. So maybe round 2 will be better...",1
1504,"This place was a hit! Glad I came and tried their Chicago style beef hot dog with all the good ole toppings. The fries were hot, crispy and just the right amount of saltiness.

Loved the classic American diner vibes inside. I’m so happy I came here. My only complaint was how slow the wait was for the online order of fries my hubby placed. This place was packed on a Sunday night.",1
1505,"The wait is worth it, it is definitely good iconic food! The place is fun, and it's neat to look around and take everything in. Definitely a place I would recommend to tourists, but the lines and wait times can be up to an hour or more before your food is in hand. We recommend get there during ""off times"" - so before noon, after 2, before 5, etc etc. They messed up part of our order, and it would have taken so long to fix it that we just let it go. They are good, delicious, but busy! Be prepared to wait.",1
1506,"A friend ordered a delivery of dogs, all the trimmings and the beef. It was all amazing!!!! Shipped 1,000 miles and was perfect when we received it. Best dogs on the planet!!! Beef is unbelievable!!!",1
1507,"It’s Chicago iconic hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches and whole lot more! Arrived and everything was quick swift and plentiful! A bang for the buck indeed! And the indoor decorations are a nice touch!!",1
1508,I now love Chicago style hot dogs! So good! The Italian beef and sausage sandwich was great too. Fun place!,1
1509,"What a beautiful venue with some quality fast food. We ordered the Italian beef and sausage combo sandwich and portillos beef Hot Dog both very delicious, especially the sandwich. I also recommend getting the side of Portillo’s—Giardiniera sauce. Very tasty.",1
1510,I never had a Chicago hot dog so I decided to check them out. I loved the hustle and bustle of this place.  The hot dog was pretty good. The chocolate cake was delicious!,1
1511,"The hotdogs notthing special,just another hotdog a warm soft bun,pepers were pickled and spicy.
The chocolate cake is a generous portion size,moist soft and delicious. The frosting is a tad too sweet for my liking.Overall a good way to finish off a meal.",1
1512,The lineup was crazy and they forgot my order completely but it was worth the wait for a true Chicago staple. Hot dog was fire and the best item we tried was the cheese and beef croissant. That was worth the drive from Toronto.,1
1513,"I really don’t know how to feel about this place. Came here with really high expectations cause of all the hype and the fact that it is an iconic spot in Chicago. The place is really cool, loved the decor and has a lot of seating available. But the food was really just bland. The chocolate cake milkshake was not as expected; the cake pieces got really soggy and mushy, not a pleasant feeling with the milkshake. Really tried liking the place but won’t be back on my next visit.",0
1514,Portillos is a Chicago staple and this one is especially unique. The decor feels very American with a slight Western feel. The queue for this Portillos is quite long but it is worth the wait. For those new to Portillos the menu is huge but don't let that intimidate you. Without a doubt the Chicago dog and the cake shake are the best combo with the cake shake being the highlight of the meal.,1
1515,"The best Chicago style hotdog in the city. If that’s not your thing, the menu is full of other options… just don’t skip out on the chocolate cake shake! The location itself is full of history and such an enjoyable experience.",1
1516,"In town for the weekend and everyone recommended we come here for the food. Grabbed an Italian beef and sausage sandwich, a hotdog with everything, and a cake shake. Food was phenomenal and the establishment contains a lot of history on the walls! Best of all it's affordable!

Highly recommend if you're in the area.",1
1517,"My husband and I visited this place a couple of times during our weekend trip to Chicago. Although it's busy, the lines move quickly. They have a wide assortment of meals (burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, sides). Our favorites were the hot dogs and their chicken noodle soup (great on a cold day!). Highly recommended!",1
1518,The atmosphere is great! It's almost like stepping back in time. The service was great! We had very little wait time to place our order and our order was ready for us in a timely manner.,1
1519,"I heard that this place was known for their Chicago style hotdogs and so I knew I had to check it out since I'm in Chicago. Their Italian beef sandwiches were the most highly recommended item to me though. The hotdog was just okay in my opinion but I could definitely see why the Italian beef is so recommended.

Food
The chili cheese dog was just alright. I was hoping it would have a good amount of chili and cheese ontop, but I barely had any cheese on it. I got mostly chili and onion taste from it. The bread was unique since it had poppy seed on the outside.

I also got a chopped salad. The salad was a hefty portion and I couldn't finish it all with my hotdog and shake. The salad dressing was the best part.

The cake shake was something I wanted to try since my friend recommended it to me. I hadn't ever had it before but it was definitely interesting. It tasted like I was drinking birthday cake (probably cause it's made using cake batter). Would get again but only once in a while since it's about 1000 Calories!!

I had a bite of my friends Italian beef and it was super good. If I came back to Portillos I would skip the dog and get the beef.

Atmosphere
Casual environment to just get a quick bite. It's got tons of neon signs on the inside and the counters still give off a feeling that you are standing at a hotdog stand.

Pricing
Not too expensive, but that's what I would expect from a hotdog and sandwich chain.

Service
Stand in 1 line to get your food, and then wait for your ticket to get called at the other window. The line went by pretty quick and it was around 8pm on a Saturday.

Other
I walked to here since I was staying downtown Chicago but didn't look like there was parking around. Look for the huge Portillo's sign!",1
1520,"Best burger in town, the place is packed with cool stuff all the way to the ceiling ...and nice ambience ...great burgers, also the Maxwell street polish sausage is killer!!! Decent prices, staff is super nice and kind , thank you Portillo, love the  restaurant decorations, good place to take the whole family for a bite ..  Gracias Portillos, definitely recommend this place, also is a Chicago Landmark",1
1521,"This place is famous for a reason and worth the hype. I got the chicago dog, italian beef with hot peppers, and the chocolate cake shake. Highly recommend all 3! It wasn't as heavy as expected with the hot dog oddly refreshing",1
1522,"I had to head over to Whole Foods on Chicago today, so thought I'd stop and grab a to-go beef. I have been a Buona Beef devotee for so long, I forgot how good a Portillo's is.

It was not yet lunch hour, so not too busy for a Saturday afternoon. I ordered a large Beef to go with extra ""au jus"" on the side.

Large 9"" Beef $9.39...$10.49 out-the-door.

One thing Portillos does that Buona needs to improve is the art of wrapping the sandwich. It was so secured and had inner wrappings. It was just very well done. Although both places put then in plastic baggies, which I appreciate.

The beef sandwich itself was already cut in half, so I don't eat the whole thing.

The taste was delish...it's Portillo's , so I mean... come on. I'm a Buona Beef lover, but lately I've not had the best beef sandwiches there.   it's been kinds disappointing. This sandwich was insanely good. I was gonna get a piece of their cake too, but almost $4 for a piece seemed  a bit pricey. I guess it might be a big piece, but I'm not that hungry, so I opted to skip it. Plus, I need to find out about potential allergens due to my own food allergies.

There's a reason people come to Chicago looking for Portillos. It does not disappoint.",1
1523,My kids and I loved Portillo’s in Chicago. Their cake shake is a “must have”. I enjoyed their tamales and my daughter really liked their bacon cheeseburger.,1
1524,"Went 2x while visiting Chicago. Dogs were GREAT, no question. The italian beef was just not great at all. Counter service staff were nice, and the orders kind of came out in a weird sequence. Couldn't find someone to pour us a beer for almost 15 minutes, and the bar area was a literal disaster - beer and glasses were everywhere!",1
1525,"An iconic Chicago Establishment with Italian beef and hot dogs. We got the Italian beef (big beef, extra gravy, hot peppers). The beef was thinly sliced with every bite perfectly proportioned and packed with flavor. Was a little surprised how light on gravy, meat, and hot peppers it was (even though we ordered  extra beef and gravy) - but the sandwich was def worth it. Plenty of places to sit",1
1526,"Very pleasantly surprised by the lack of chaos in this food court like dining experience. People were patient, staff were quick and food was good. The regular size hot dogs disappear in five bites and are definitely not enough on their menu for a full meal. The chocolate cake shake is definitely overkill and can be avoided - it is exactly how you imagine it will be minus 850 calories. The Italian Beef Sandwich was 100% awesomeness.",1
1527,"Excellent traditional place to eat the best Chicago Hot Dogs, there is always a lot of people but the truth it worth it. If you visit the city go after 3:00 pm. A must place in Chicago.",1
1528,An amazing hot dog. Appearance isn’t the best but who cares? The flavors were all great and the veggies/toppings tasted very fresh. Fair prices too,1
1529,"Overcrowded and chaotic, but yet effectively managed. Mostly. I was slightly scared by the cashier, but the crown control guy was lovely.
Prices and taste are on much with any other fast food, but this one got an Italian beef sandwich and hotdogs with pickles.",1
1530,"Visiting from the south, I was told I needed to visit Portillo’s Hot Dogs for an authentic Chicago experience. It did not disappoint! Fun atmosphere, great food, quick service…wouldn’t mind a visit in to eat again!",1
1531,We have been getting food delivered via mail since Xmas and brought  a hungry group of 15 year olds.. long line that they are eager to serve moved quickly and was well worth it.   Have fun!,1
1532,This place was so good and the atmosphere was great too! We had a Chicago dog and onion rings and they were hot and fresh. We would eat here again!,1
1533,"A place you cannot miss if you are visiting Chicago. Their hotdogs are one of the most famous one Chicago style of course. Plenty of seating in a cool decor space with details that cannot be missed. If you are not into hot dog they also have burgers, salads, pasta etc.",1
1534,"This place is ridiculously busy but the line moved like a well oiled machine. Service was friendly, staff accommodating and resturant was well maintained.
The traditional dog was....freaking amazing!  Little snap while biting, the toppings....Oi!  Not a huge hotdog connoisseur but I enjoyed this place and would eat that weiner again!
Ohhh...onion rings were crunchy and that's real niaaccee!",1
1535,"This location is insanely busy. The food is good but good luck getting what you ordered. We ordered a combo but didn't get the sausage. The line was too long to take it back. The order was entered correctly.
I'd try another location if possible.",1
1536,"Extremely unique, and charming american food diner. As a traveller i greatly enjoyed coming here and trying their specialities and mixing in with the locals. The prices are fairly reasonable, and the food is good, with that special american vibe. Highly reccomend",1
1537,"Went in to get their famous chocolate cake but they have new lemon cake too.  So I got both.  They are delicious.

Edit to add:  Had their Chicago dog today.  Omg delicious.  And I am not even a fan of hotdog.",1
1538,"Husband and I went here for dinner.  Hubs had Burger and a hot dog (mustard and ketchup).  I had the chopped salad (it was delicious!) and I figured I couldn’t come to Chicago without getting a Chicago hot dog minus the peppers.  I really liked it.  Very clean, fast service even though it was busy.",1
1539,"Went here off recommendation of friends and so glad we did.  Traditional Chicago beef dogs, BUT, you have to try the Beef Sandwich!! 3 ways it is prepared,  and you can not go wrong with any way.  We had dogs, Beef Sandwich,  Chicken Sandwich,  and Bacon Cheeseburger.   Fries with cheese as sides.  All great.   Wish we had this in Dallas!",1
1540,"Hot Beef sandwich 4 stars
This came out piping hot.

Beef hot dog 4 stars
For a hot dog it was pretty good.

Service was pretty standard for a fast food like environment.

The problem is you have to wait a very long time. For these two items we waited half an hour.
Not a place I'd return to for that reason. My friend thought less of the food, but a 4 means I did like it. I was also starving when I got there.",1
1541,"Chicago classic, the hot dog had a nice taste and snap to it, pickle was perfect. Fries are nothing crazy you can easily skip out on them and get yourself another hotdog",1
1542,one of the tourist must gos within Chicago.  they do serve a decent polish and it was decently sized (i.e. fortunately not too much).  the sausage tasted rich and the prices were reasonable.,1
1543,"I’m not sure why but Portillo’s in Chicago is just better than the ones I visited in Scottsdale and Tampa (Brandon).  I brought a co-worker who was blown away.  I had Italian Beef with hot and sweet peppers, my co-worker had a Chicago Hot dog and we both shared cheese fries.  I just wish we had room for cake or a shake……",1
1544,"Was in search of the historic Chicago dog, and heard this was the iconic place to go. Lovely inside atmosphere with tonsssss of available seating. Lime will be long but it moves quickly!",1
1545,"It’s an experience in itself… cool building.  Seems to be the place to try all the Chicago “street food” classics.

Had my first Italian Beef sandwich — it was ok , didn’t seed any deep cravings to try it again.  Reminded me of a beef dip but in a soggy bun. Tasted great, just messier than I’d like. 🤷

Fries were ok, saved by the cheese sauce!  Also really enjoyed the chocolate milkshake.

Efficient service with a single queue, plenty of seating.",1
1546,"The food is very good, this place has its Chicago character, well decorated, however the service in my opinion is insufficient for the demand. Usually there are long lines and wait time, so be patient...",1
1547,"Had the Italian Beef Sandwich, fries, bottled water and the highly recommended chocolate cake shake all for a very reasonable $20! It was damn good and that shake was ridiculously good- the only knock is that the sandwich was a little soggy. Very quick service!",1
1548,"Hot Dog eh.. NY dogs are better. Less is more with dogs in my opinion. Now the italian beef sandwich was outstanding. Get it with mozz, hot peepers and gravy. You will be good to go.",1
1549,"Love the lemon cake, I'm not sure who makes the decision to only have it available as a seasonal item but we need to enjoy it year around. Can we get a petition started to keep the lemon cake on the menu across all seasons...I'll be the first to sign.",1
1550,"Most amazing Italian beef sandwiches. Be sure to get them with extra gravy. The hot dogs are sooooo good too. And Don’t be afraid of the unnaturally green relish, it’s to die for.",1
1551,The service was great and welcoming. Food was not it. The hotdogs we're alright. The beef and sausage was regular and had no flavor/seasoning whatsoever. The chocolate cake was regular. So much rave and it was underwhelming.,0
1552,"Was high disappointed with my meal here. Everything sounded delicious and looked great but each food item had no flavor. If the meal before and after this had no flavor as well, I would have suspected covid, but sadly this was not the case. How do you screw up French Fries and Chocolate Cake?",0
1553,"A beautiful Chicago building. Inside you'll find a food market. There's a pizza /pasta,  burgers/dogs,  and a bar stall. The burgers and hot dogs are the real deal. Very satisfying food and a nice place to sit (ground floor and a mezzanine floor).",1
1554,"Good food and Chicago staple.
It's a good place to grab a quick meal if you're on the run in Chicago. If it's your first time then it's worth a trip to one location.
I'm more a fan of the Italian beef while the others in my party really lived the all beef hot dogs.
I made them eat the famous cake on this trip as well which they enjoyed. They said it tasted pretty good and that it was very moist.",1
1555,"The Italian Beef is nowhere near what it once was. The cheddar and beef croissant was also a disappointment. What really makes the review a 2 and not a 3 was the service. It took 41 minutes to get our food and it was cold. No excuse provided, no reason, just take your food and go. This is disappointing as I once raved and recommended Portillo's to anyone.",0
1556,"Veggie dog was really good. Definitively did not fool the meat-eaters because of texture, but the long-term vegetarians thought it was just as good as real meat.

When standing in line, staff warned us to not hang our bags off our chairs because of theft.",1
1557,When I think of Chicago - I think(dream) of Portillo's. Love the atmosphere and Chicago style hot dogs. Fries are on point every time. Can't not visit this place when I'm in town.,1
1558,I'm very glad I came here. This is my first time in Chicago but it will not be my last. Me and my wife had the Italian beef and the polish. The Italian beef was good but it was spicy especially with the peppers. The polish was my favorite! The fries were good too. Everything was fresh and made to order. The staff treated us like family as soon as we walked through the door. This is a great place to come.,1
1559,"Wow good fat boy food on vacation!
Chicago dog's!! Loved it!!
Great experience!
Good friendly staff & atmosphere.",1
1560,Traveled from Texas to Chicago in memory fo my life long friend Tom Cregan who swore that this is the best hot dog in the world. He grew up in Chicago and was there when the first store opened. Excellent dog and great atmosphere!,1
1561,Had to try their hotdogs. They didn't disappoint. Very tasty. Loved the old style decor.,1
1562,Too many people but the line moved fast and they gave me my food also pretty fast. Food's good. They have a plant based hot dog!!!,1
1563,"wow. never have I gotten such good service and fantastic food. it was my first time here and I got the italian beef and it was yummy. I received exceptional service from the employees and even though they were super busy, they never messed up an order or slipped up. I'll make sure to come back whenever I return to Chicago.",1
1564,"I don’t really get the hype over the hot dog. It’s okay, it taste like a regular hot dog with hot peppers on it. Chocolate cake was good but nothing extraordinary. Service was good and happy the server recommended the Italian beef with cheese sauce.

Pro tip: Get the Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers and cheese sauce. It was the best thing I ate. They also give free refills on drinks.",1
1565,"The jury’s still out on this infamous, Chicago based restaurant chain. Fun experience, but I’ve had better hot dogs. Maybe it’s a Chicago thing! 🤷🏾‍♀️",1
1566,"If you're looking for great hotdogs and you're in Chicago, you need to eat here. They have a great variety in their menu and everything my group of friends ate was amazing. From Hotdogs, chicken nuggets, onion rings, cheese fries, all the way to shakes, it did not disappoint!",1
1567,"This review is specifically about the Barnelli’s pasta and salad section. The quality has gone down tremendously. I used to order the penne diavalo semi-regularly before the pandemic and it was creamy and flavorful. I decided to finally order it again tonight and it was the exact opposite of how I remembered. My pasta was bland and hardly had any sauce — just a bowl of butter noodles. On top of that, I ordered a lemon cake slice and it was not included in my bag. Very disappointing visit.",0
1568,for any 1st visit to Chicago of course this has to be a visit. Had beef dip and chili cheese dog with krinkle fries and probably the best onion rings ever had!!! 🌶🌭🍟🥤,1
1569,"Best hotdog ever…it was full of meats in the sausage and other vegetables, and the fries are great as well. I miss Chicago…",1
1570,"Had to try a Chicago-style hot dog while we were in the city. There was a line out the door at this place, but it was still pretty quick. Order online beforehand if you're in a rush. The place was massive, two floors actually with plenty of seating. The hot dog was great, but the polish sausage was overdone. I'd still check it out though. Was a little hesitant because it was a chain restaurant, but now I understand why there are so many of these throughout the city.",1
1571,"Nice and tasty for a fast food joint. The picture doesn’t do it justice, but the Italian beef packs some flavour, especially if you get it double dipped - which I like, but can be a little too soggy for other peoples taste.

As with a lot of fast food places it seemed a little     lacking in that genuine local deli atmosphere, but that’s not necessarily what you go here for.

I recommend if you’re passing through Chicago and fancy something quick.",1
1572,Chicago staple. I used to walk here in the dead of winter for the Italian beef sandwiches!  Highly recommend you all try that with peppers and cheese.  I've never had the dogs but hear they are delicious as well.  The lines look long but it goes pretty quick.  The only downside are some of the super rude staff that outright ignore you and don't even look you in the eye while taking your order.,1
1573,Easy to get a space. Good Beers/Ales on tap. The Roast Beef with Dip was good. The Hot Dogs/Polish Dogs were average,1
1574,Best place in Chicago for hot dogs. Authentic food and experience. Must stop while in Chicago.,1
1575,"The food was a unique experience to Chicago and a must stop if visiting the city. The Chicago dog was good and the cake shake was a delightful journey.

The reason for the low rating, however, is because of the rudeness of the staff and horrible logistics of picking up your order. Maybe I'm used to the Midwest ""nice"" but the service and logistics need a lot of help.",0
1576,Damn tasty dogs! One of our crew got the ribs and loved 'em. The salted caramel shake was awesome!,1
1577,"My boyfriend and I took the train from Michigan to Chicago with the sole mission to try the chocolate cake shake, recommended by Gabriel Iglesias, aka ""Fluffy"". We were not disappointed! When you walk in the door, there is a definite energetic bustle as people wander around the various stations deciding what to treat their taste buds to. I tried the Italian beef sandwich, extra gravy please! It was delicious and juicy ,as was the cheeseburger my boyfriend gobbled down. But the creme de la creme was by far the shake. Oooh, there's a whole slice of FROSTED chocolate cake in the shake! I didn't actually believe that was going to be the case, so imagine my surprise when my straw hit a lump at the bottom of the cup and I worked to suck up the most delicious of decadent delights! Totally worth the trip! Shout out to the staff as well. I've never encountered a place quite as efficient. Well done,  Portillos!",1
1578,"It's just a hot dog, right? No, you're wrong. This is heaven in a bun. The mustard, pickle, hot peppers...everything just makes it amazing. Easily the best hot dog I even thought was possible.",1
1579,Famed local food. Definitely worth a try. Not only for the food but for the shop itself too.,1
1580,The inside is really interesting and fun to look around in if it's your first time. The food there is pretty good not above and beyond but it's good. The way to order is definitely confusing but the staff are pretty nice,1
1581,Best hands down on the planet. Everytime I have been it has been such a good experience. Quick and organized. Staff is a well oiled machine and the food is always perfect.,1
1582,"I'm never not gonna rave about Portillos. It's just fricken good. Chocolate cake shake is a must, and the polish sausage is also delicious",1
1583,"The food here is pretty good, but I'm not sure that it was up to the hype when we visited. The experience was a little spoiled by the servers who were hard to understand and very unhelpful. Despite our number being called multiple times, we kept getting told to 'go away' and 'go over there'. There's a bar that has a huge ""Mai Tai"" sign above it, but when we asked for them we were told they don't make Mai Tais which was odd. The decor is pretty cool and a lot of the artefacts have little explanations next to them.",1
1584,"I love hotdogs, can't say that I've ever had a bad hotdog. However, this was one of the best hotdogs I've ever eaten! I had a chilli cheese dog. Very, very good! I also love crinkle cut fries so I was very happy to see that was what they served!",1
1585,"Food was good but worst service I have ever had. Ordered a big beef sandwich with a chocolate shake and it took 25-30 minutes to get it. The other 5 people in my group got their food in under 5 minutes so I tried to ask the person giving food out for an update after waiting around 15 minutes and she looked at me then walked away without saying anything 3 times. Finally she said ""it's coming"" without actually looking for the ticket. I asked her for a refund since the food hadn't shown up and the rest of my group was done eating already and was told to get back in line. The manager must have noticed how long I was waiting because he finally got involved and got the food out. The employees were watching videos on their phone rather than making food as well.",0
1586,"Excellent food. Bustling ambiance. Great spot for a bite, expecially if you're looking to try a Chicago dog. Look up the history. The founding story is neat.",1
1587,"Took advantage of free delivery. Food arrived cold and over 2 hour wait.  Milkshake, milk. Was told it was a MUST try while in the Chicago area.  Food was not good. Zero flavor in the beef. Tasted like it was prepared with no seasonings.  Hotdogs were nothing special.  How can grease taste stale? Expensive disappointment. Wouldn't recommend.",0
1588,"I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce with the chocolate cake that's supposed to be amazing, in a bottle of water. The food was good and the cake was amazing as advertised. The issue was and went to my table and I was missing both the chocolate cake and the water so I had to go back and get it. Not a terrible deal, but had I left the restaurant I would not have known that my drink in dessert were not in the bag. Overall though, pretty good",1
1589,"Really good food! Clean and spacious! Friendly staff! Had the burger, Polish hot dog, and Italian beef sandwich!",1
1590,"This is probably the best hot dog you can eat, full of flavors. For me, the story with ketchup was fascinating and so funny.",1
1591,Fries and cheese are amazing. Hot dog and cake shake were pretty average. The beers are served in giant chalices at a good price. It's fast casual style so you find your own seats. I would recommend stopping by to experience one of Chicago's most famous food joints. Probably don't bother if you are looking for top tier service and food.,1
1592,"I went here twice on my trip to Chicago. The first visit was a rainy Monday evening. It was empty, and the service was efficient, but not very friendly. The second time was a Friday afternoon and it was jam packed, the line was all the way to the door. Placed an online order and got food for five people faster than the one guy in front of me.

The Chicago style hot dog is just a hot dog that you can make at home with some common produce.  Out your can get it almost anywhere in Chicago.

The Italian beef is a much better choice. I'm no Italian beef expert, but it's much more flavorful than the dog. I had mine with peppers and slightly wet, and I regret that I had more hot dogs than Italian beefs on my trip.

The chocolate cake shake is the best shake I've had in a while. The large chunk of came at the bottom is a great twist to the traditional shake.",1
1593,An obligated visit. Great flavor and better prices. I’ve always loved the Chicago style hot dog.,1
1594,Came here Nov. 2021 on a cold Sunday morning at 10 AM. A few others had the same idea to beat the lines later in the day. Fresh hot dogs and sausage with a nice crisp crunch to the meat. Would go next time to get the classic Portillo’s hot dog and a shake.,1
1595,"Came here for an Italian beef. Got what I expected. Great counter service from the gentleman handing out orders. Place was quite packed at 10:45pm on a Monday evening, but so glad they are open late. Google Maps says open until 12am but they closed at 11p. So call ahead or re-check before going late. There was a lady working hard to keep the dining room clean after every table was cleared; before a new guest sat down: this lady deserves a raise!",1
1596,Best Italian beef and chicago  dogs. You can get. Just be patient  very busy so takes some time. Also two line,1
1597,"Portillo’s Hot Dogs has some of the best hot dogs in Chicago. Because they have the best hot dogs, the restaurant is very busy, and therefore there is little to no seating. I luckily was able to snag a seat outside on the patio. When entering the building, you’ll most likely be greeted by a huge line all the way to the doorway. Don’t worry, the line moves quickly, and you’ll get through it with little problems. Instead of spending an exuberant amount on drinks, I hopped over to the McDonald’s next door to get drinks after I was done eating.",1
1598,"The food is amazing, and the mood of the restaurant itself is so impressive, it sets the mood for a classic meal in the 1900s",1
1599,Fast service / friensly staff & reasonable price.. Was a pleasant surprise.. and it tastes damn good,1
1600,"A must-try when in Chicago. The Portillo classics are very good; hotdogs, Polish sauage and the pene pastas. I am not much of a hot dog fan, but this one is good without relying on ketchup.The reataurant is huge, with nice nostalgic decors. The location is ok and needs walking to the nearest CTA station when taking the train. The service is fast and efficient. The downside is that they've reduced their sitting capacity,  but nut per covid standards. The provisioned dining area is small and cramped despite the huge space that the restaurant has.",1
1601,The Maxwell was amazing! So much flavor in this polish sausage. I will be stopping  by again to try the beef sandwich before my trip ends!,1
1602,We were in heaven eating the Chicago dogs! Holy cow they are good! We don’t even like hot dogs and weren’t expecting much here but it was phenomenal! Loved the bun and the crunch of the veggies. Definitely will be back when we’re in Chicago! Chocolate cake was yummy too!,1
1603,"Finally visited this iconic place and it did not disappoint! Great spot, quick and friendly service and the food is to die for. I loved the interior and the design, it is a spacious space with seating upstairs, too and the music truly matches to the vibes.  My fav was the hot dog and the chocolate cake.",1
1604,"One of the city’s staple restaurants! Portillo’s is a family-friendly place to dine-in or takeout for vienna beef hot dogs, Italian beef, and sausage sandwiches. The fries are good too and they also have healthy options. My go-to is the cheeseburger with Italian beef on the top, barbecue sauce, and giardiniera hot peppers with a side of fries.",1
1605,"I appreciate the drive thru at this location, but the parking lot can get messy with long lines and to get in and out. Good thing service was mostly speedy and the hot dog was worth the wait.",1
1606,Interestingly enough the hamburger was like the most unexpected pleasure. The hot dog was okay. The cheese fries definitely not. The chopped salad was amazingly good. That's all I can tell you about it .. it was good. if you're going to Chicago for great food I would say go to the pizza joint.,1
1607,"First time visiting Chicago so of course I had to try the Chicago dog, and based on what we heard and saw around the city Portillo's is the place to try them at and let me tell you the inside is very cool looking every second you will see something new, it's very large and fast. There was a huge line and no seats anywhere but sure enough we had our food and a table ready in no time. Fair price for the delicious hotdog. In the picture is the jumbo version and I would highly recommend it.",1
1608,"Portillo's rocks! The beef sandwich is fantastic, with mounds of beef on the big. Top it off with the hot and the sweet peppers, your mouth will thank you! (And burn a bit...) We have a Portillo's close to home on the west coast, but anytime I get a chance to visit Chicago I try to get in here. Great atmosphere and a cool looking interior.",1
1609,A must do for the foodie! The lines can get long. I recommend ordering online and picking up. Find a table outside and enjoy! The dessert…. 😋,1
1610,"Any time I come to Chicago, Portillo’s is a must have. Beef and sausage combo is sooooo good. Now if they’d only open up in Denver!",1
1611,Chicago landmark fast food joint.  Place to grab a beer and Chicago dog or three.  It's an experience.,1
1612,Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and realized there was no beef patty when I got home.  Emailed the store and was promised $20 gift card on my online account … I never got that.  Here’s the evidence.,0
1613,"Amazing hotdogs and food! A friend recommended this place to us and it was incredible. I highly recommend the Chicago dog, onion rings and the Maxwell Street Polish. Sadly, they left out one of our hotdogs we ordered so always check the bag before you leave. But otherwise, 5 stars! Check it out!",1
1614,"Great establishment, although there was a line to order it was moving and service was swift nothing spectacular to brag about… The hotdogs were tasty and the service was great… my on complaint being a foodie is, I got a regular hotdog and should have ordered a JUMBO being a meat lover…",1
1615,disappointed in the dogs. chili dog was passable but nothing special; the pictured one was overcooked and didn’t have enough toppings. respect the size for the beers tho. and you can’t go wrong with the shakes.,1
1616,Chicago Excursion Review:  So we were on our way to Al's #1 Italian Beef and happened upon this spot.  I immediately was drawn to it because of it's circus like decor and they advertised a Strawberry Cake Shake.  So we put of Al's and decided to go here. (See my review on Al's)  Once inside we were greeted by a nice elderly gentleman who guided me to a line.  I place the order and had to wait for our number to be called.  Once I got the food I was pleased.  The fries were good and the Italian Beef was tasty.  You have a choice of wet or dry.  I chose dry but put the juice on the side. All in all it is good but needs something to put it over the top.  It is better than Al's IMO.  The milkshake is a lot thick and is just ice cream in a cup so be aware of that.,1
1617,Crunchy hot dogs smothered with toppings. The food coma that came afterwards was good too.,1
1618,"We were visiting family in Chicago and this is always a great stop for great hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. Food comes out quick and it’s delicious. Not gonna lie, was expecting some “indigestion” from the hot dogs but did not have any. ☺️ Staff was polite.",1
1619,"Great food, fast service. The large Italian beef, wet was enormous, and delicious. The burger had a nice, charred, fresh grilled flavor. Amazing!",1
1620,Absolutely love their Italian beef sandwich soaked in gravy. Finger licking food:),1
1621,"Deceiving, probably because my expectations were very high built upon more than 14K reviews with a good score and a large queue for ordering at arrival.

To me, the food did not hit the mark.

Nothing stand out from a regular hot dog cart you might find out in any major city; neither the bun, nor the sausage, cucumber of frozen curly fries.

Sorry Chicago, I hope I am not offending you with this review on what probably is a fast food institution in town.",0
1622,"Was really excited to try this place as I love a good Chicago dog. Waited while 5 people behind us got their meals first then found out 10 minutes after we asked about our order that their printer didn't print our ticket. The food was good polish sausage was better than the portillos hot dog. If you want a decent hot dog this place was okay. Cool decor and looks to be efficient, maybe just had a run of bad luck.",1
1623,Great food. Authentic atmosphere. Had a great lunch while visiting during a road trip across the USA in 2019,1
1624,We went there to taste their famous Chicago style hot dogs and it was amazing. The prices are also affordable,1
1625,"Crazy long line when we arrived, waited about an hour from the time we got there to receiving our food. Fries and chopped salad were amazing as always. This location seems to be fairly busy all the time, if you’re on a time crunch maybe check out another location. They did have plenty of seating which was nice. Overall a good visit.",1
1626,"If you visit Chicago, you have to try Portillo's. What started out as a one man hot dog stand, has become a multi-location comfort food mecca.

From hot dogs and roast beef sandwiches, to desserts, this place is a must do.

My favorite, a Big Beef, dipped, with hot and sweet peppers. To die for! Don't forget the napkins!",1
1627,"Its sad that u got trolls giving this place a bad review, next time go eat a salad or something! This is a must place to visit when in Chicago, Italian beef sandwich was awesome, just wish I got the bigger size",1
1628,"Great dogs, fast lines. Wish there was more seating. Had the chili cheese dog & fries. The inside was super interesting with lots to look at. Whole thing started off on a solid foot by being greeted by a kind older gentleman when we walked through the door.",1
1629,"Everything we heard about! The italian beef was awesome!  On a Sunday night in the middle of summer 2022, the place was packed. The staff kept  everything moving and orders were filled quick. Place is clean and the atmosphere is fun! Shakes are perfect, too! Need to go back for a hot dog!",1
1630,"Fun place for a classic Chicago style meal. The food is tasty, you can get your drink on, its safe for the kids, they have a cake shake. A whole piece of cake.  In a shake. Tastes like a slice of nostalgia!
Open late, perfect for late night munchies.
If you aren't a fan of American fare, you need to go for the memorabilia alone.  Portillo's is what i would call a museum of Chicago history. For everyone who visits the beautiful city, its a MUST see.",1
1631,"Popular place to eat! Line out the door, moved fast, they did give me the wrong hotdog at first but just talk to them and they gave me a new one, no questions asked. There’s a top floor where you can  sit incase the lower floor is crowded.",1
1632,Best cake shake I've ever had and my first Chicago dog!!,1
1633,"Had to stop by for some Chicago flavor and was not disappointed! Big Beef, Portillo's way with a cake shake! Yummo!",1
1634,"Gotta understand this isn't a fancy place. Just went to check Chicago dog of the list. I thought service was quick and good compared to New York, but what is expect from a city with quick service. The Portillo dog was good for me, though my wife didn't like the relish and peppers. Is say it's a good place for a quick lunch and I personally liked the hot dog. Fries were hot and crispy. I would go again.",1
1635,This is hands down the best hotdog I've ever had. It looked a mess but was simply amazing. I am a loyal customer for life.,1
1636,"Ok..It felt a little chaotic at first..Maybe because I didn’t know what to expect.
But once I got the way it works it was fine,great food,the burgers and hot dogs and the roast beef sandwiches…just delicious ! We actually had it a couple times as well…It gets really busy so be ready to wait for your food just a bit longer…",1
1637,"This is definitely a place to his it while being in Chicago. Don't waste your time and just get the Italian beef sandwich, they're all good but this is the best. I tried Maxwell Street Polish which is also good and I also reccomend that.
Be aware that this place will be busy must  of the time, however don't be scared by the long line that can start at the door, they're fast taking orders and having the food ready.",1
1638,"I came here because everyone was talking about the hot dog, I tried it but it was ok, nothing out of this world, maybe next time I should try something different, the attention was fine, the people that are there are clearly overworked, it was a little crowded but the space was fine, you could find a place to sit very easily.",1
1639,"A Chicago staple recommended by many. Beef sandwich 👍 just make sure it’s dipped. Hot dog 👍just make sure no ketchup, ever.",1
1640,"Delicious! The Fries, shakes and chocolate cake are my faves. Of course the hot dogs. I prefer chili cheese dogs.  Not a huge fan of Italian beef so I can’t judge. But you must come here while in Chicago.",1
1641,"Efficient lines and operation.  The Italian beef and sausage sandwich was delicious.  Greasy, but in the best way.  The sausage was nicely spiced and buried at the bottom of the Italian beef slices.  The grilled peppers and the spiced peppers gave each bite a nice combination of juicy flavors and a spicy kick.",1
1642,"Iconic Chicago place where literally the entire menu tastes great. Sandwiches, Hot Dogs, burgers you name it.
Highly recommended",1
1643,"The environment was friendly. The food was just regular. It wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't great, but for the cost, it was perfect. The service was fast! My brother enjoyed his cake shake; I had a chili dog, and it was probably the most liked item within our group.",1
1644,Good hotdogs. Shakes are world class. Place was packed. Reasonably priced as well.,1
1645,It's ok.. not as good as many other places. My favourite Chicago style hotdog (by far) was Kim and Carlo's hotdog cart.,1
1646,"We loved that we could do the drive through in the city and it was no McDonald’s drive thru meal.

We had to snap a quick pic of the food before it got eaten.

Very good dogs!

The drive thru was a little slow but nothing ridiculous.

A fantastic addition to our trip to Chicago",1
1647,"This was a stop on our walking food tour.  Loved the hot dog so we decided to come back on our own for lunch.  Large variety of food...we each had the spaghetti lunch.  It was delicious, as were the milkshakes.  Fries were a little undercooked, but not enough to take a star.  And not sure who the gentleman was at the door, but he's worth a stop here all by himself!!",1
1648,"An institution. The decor is lovely and worth a stop just for that reason. The famous hot dog was alright, but I make a better one at home. I wish the casing had a bit more bite and the peppers a bit more heat. I am glad they have a plant based dog for vegans and vegetarians.",1
1649,"Great atmosphere, traditional Chicago fare. The beef sandwiches here were amazing",1
1650,Very good hotdogs and burgers! The lemon cake was moist and delicious. Food came out hot and quick,1
1651,"Chile Hot Dog, Fríes, and Onion Rings all were Excellent, I highly recommend it!",1
1652,"Great food and great service, it's so difficult to choose what to eat because everything is so good on the menu. The hot dogs, the Italian beef, the French fries and onion rings, it's all so good. Then top it off with a chocolate cake shake that is amazing.",1
1653,"When searching for Chicago 'must' Italian Beef came up and Portillo's does it right. The ambience of the place is fantastic and immediately upon walking in I knew it was the right place. The Italian Beef, extra gravy and peppers, was fantastic and so glad I came here. The Chicago Dog was excellent as well.",1
1654,"Extremely affordable and delicious food options. We had the chili dog which was tasty, but still just an above average hot dog. The real standout for us was the sausage. It was juicy, delicious, and spiced just right. The beer was ice cold and a good variety. The fries were bland but the cheese dipping sauce really saved the day. We dipped the fries and the hotdogs in the cheese and it was yummy. We had 2 hotdogs 2 sausages, 2 beers , and fries/cheese sauce on the side and spent around $30 total and left feeling properly full. Definitely a go-to spot for good, cheap eats. The staff were a little indifferent. Not rude, but not friendly. However, we're visiting from Canada so this could just be a cultural difference 🤷‍♂️",1
1655,"What an experience. Everyone I know recommended this hot dog stop to me, and I’m so glad I had to opportunity to visit while I was here in Chicago. The dog was very well done, but more importantly the cake shake so delicious and rich. I will have to visit more locations. Only reason that I don’t give them a 5 star review is because I tore my ACL on their curb walking in. Very painful!",1
1656,"I visited Chicago over the Taste of Chicago weekend with my friend in July. We tried Portillo's since there was only 1 hot dog vendor s at the Taste which was a surprise.  Ordering our food was simple and ordered basically at the same time. Her food took at least 10 min after mine (Chicago dog and soda) and I ordered a Chili dog w/onions and a Chocolate cake milkshake. The shake was good to try for a 1st time but wouldn't order again.  The 3 stars is I don't know any other restaurants who have a sign saying orders may be out of order so not to come ask about your order. It's not rocket science to give customers their order in a sequential way unless they have a special order which we did not. Their random process of giving their orders is crazy and unfortunate. If you go, don't go when it's busy or unless you are by yourself or you'll be more annoyed than excited to visit the restaurant. If they would take the time to fix their process instead of making excuses with their sign, this would be a great restaurant to visit in Chicago.",1
1657,"One of the cheaper options to eat in the area. But, hot dog wasn’t that great, staff was rude. The set up is also really weird. A/C wasn’t on. best part was the decorations. I wasn’t impressed at all.",1
1658,"Awesome-looking place! Busy, but they had the lines moving quickly, and there were plenty of tables. Grabbed a jumbo Portillio hot dog! 👌😋 Thinking about those ribs, though.... 🤔",1
1659,"I received the delivery through the door dash. They missed half of my food. I received half the food. It is waste of money. I called the person who delivered it, but she didn't answer it. They ruined my last meal in Chicago. Never deliver. Pick me up yourself.",0
1660,Portillo's! Always a favorite to visit when in Chicago. The Italian beef with hot peppers is the best!,1
1661,This is my first time visiting Chicago and this was on my list of places to eat at and for me it did not disappoint. My first authentic Chicago dog and sausage and beef with peppers were delicious. Don’t forget to get a cake shake or really any dessert they all seem good,1
1662,"Food is good enough for an ok price

Problem is queueing system (separate lanes) and wait time for food. So it may be cheaper than sitting down somewhere else but you wait for 40 min..",0
1663,"The food was good, the ordering process was long, so be prepared to spend 1hr+. Difficult to find seating. Manager was walking around advising all guests there was a pick pocket in the restaurant, to hold our purses close. Definitely put a damper on our experience.",1
1664,"All Portillo's restaurants share one critical and endearing property: they make my favorite cheeseburger on the planet.

Also, good to very good onion rings, great Italian Beef sandwiches, good portion sizes, affordable prices, and often an upbeat atmosphere with acceptably quick service. Highly Recommended.",1
1665,Very busy but neat place! The Chicago dogs were mighty scrumptious.  Italian beef was on point  👌 the whole place was a vibe. Neat seeing all the autographs of celebrities that had came in. Definitely a must in Chicago,1
1666,Food was great! Drinks were good. Cleanliness wasn't so hot. Customer Service dealing with orders at the pick up station was difficult and could be improved a lot. They had our orders for almost an hour and never even called our number.,1
1667,"Fun and interesting fast casual establishment. The jumbo hot dog was not as large as I expected it to be, but it was rather inexpensive so I can forgive that. Combo is beefy, be ready for a lot of meat on the sandwich. Service is fine, nothing to write home about.",1
1668,"Slow service, but good food. Make sure not to come here during rush hour, lines are long. Order online 15-30 mins in advance.

Especially like the Chicago Dog - it's a classic. Their shakes are delicious and their chili cheese dogs are great too.",1
1669,"Omg. Total taste bud delight! The decor made me feel I was in a living childhood film, the food was devine. The employees were fast paced and courteous .",1
1670,Great food! Highly recommend! Only complaint is the order window cashier was very rude acted like she didn’t want to take anyones order or work.,1
1671,I came for a Chicago style hot dog and was blown away by how good this veggie dog tasted!!! They exceeded my expectations. I love it here!!!!!,1
1672,"Excellent food, although the restaurant gets really crowded.",1
1673,Service was pretty quick for the amount of customers.  They did forget the cheese cup.  Food was pretty good.,1
1674,"The vibe is 100% the reason to come. Like the food is great but the vibe... Fun place and expect a decent wait if you come on a Saturday or Sunday! Hot dogs are tasty, if you're feeling crazy go for the chocolate cake shake!",1
1675,"First visit from outta town. Torn between the dragged through the garden Chicago hot dog & the Italian beef sandwich.. What's a food tourist to do? Get one of each! The dog was really a treat. Inhaled it in about 90 seconds. The beef sandwich was also really good! But, if forced to choose only one I'd say the dog would win. But it'd be a hard choice",1
1676,"Pretty inexpensive considering for downtown Chicago. Was good, had a hot dog, polish dog, and the Italian beef all were very good.",1
1677,"Hot dog extremely overrated. Beer on the other hand, superb! Really cold and good value.",0
1678,Joann was a nice customer service to and helpful in the line. The menu had a variety of options. The wait for food after ordering was a bit long.,1
1679,"Place was decent, but overrated. Hot dogs were good but not amazing. Chicken sandwich was mostly breading. Do not get the chocolate cake shake. It literally just tastes like a milkshake with soggy, chewed-up cake inside. The milkshakes and cakes on their own are good, separately.",1
1680,"Amazing food, i really loved everything i tried. Best chocolate cake ever.",1
1681,I'm visiting Chicago and everyone recommended we try Portillo's and let me tell you they did not disappoint! The BEST chili cheese hotdogs I've ever had IN MY LIFE! Highly recommend. And the employees were very friendly.,1
1682,Great Chicago Dog! Will have to return for the beef sandwich!,1
1683,"Had the Italian Beef again and it was every bit as delicious as the first time I had it here a few years back. Also, love the chocolate cake shake. Staff was friendly and the decor is fun!",1
1684,Long lines. When you finally order you need to wait for about one hour to get your food. Terrible organized. In my own experience:I receive my pasta 30 min after I placed my order I asked for other part of my order and II was told that I need to wait.40 min later I request to speak to the manager to find out what happened with my food. Then immediately a young lady gave me the food. I only give them 2 stars because the waitress was kind and professional.I recommend it only if you have the enough patience to wait one hour for fast food.,0
1685,Lost our order so took about 40 minutes to get it all. Being told to go one side to get some food and the other to get the rest. The chocolate cake shake is alright but for being famous not much to brag about the other places might be better but won't go back to that one.,0
1686,"I ordered the beef and cheddar croissant.  No cheese.  Paid extra for the sweet peppers.  One tiny piece, plus I had some hot peppers I didn't want. I have gone to this place for years, and always recommend but this was horrible.  Plus when I tried to call phone kept disconnecting.",0
1687,"Yes, the food (Hotdog, Italian Beef Sandwich and Cake Shake) was good, but it was neither low budget nor fast (food) - it took 25 minutes AFTER I ordered (didn’t time the waiting time in the queue) to get the food. Come in once it’s not crowded, if there already is a crowd… your call…",1
1688,We stopped by the drive thru with my kids. There was a very nice gentleman working the last window giving us our food. Nice small talk very charming. Good luck tomorrow at school on your first day of football! I wish all Portillo’s staff had the same courtesy for all their guest.,1
1689,"If you are wanting to experience a Chicago style hotdog, this is the place. Super cool ambiance. Packed with locals. In the center of downtown and the hotdog itself was pretty good. The beef dog is big and juice and all the ingredients compliment each other.",1
1690,"I see that Portillo's is always ranked in the top 5 on best Chicago dog lists. Sorry, but it was a tasteless hotdog and the toppings didn't have the zing or freshness as one we got near Cloud Gate. I've had Chicago dogs from about 5 different vendors and this was dead last on my list. Overall, the atmosphere was great and we did enjoy the shakes and sides.",0
1691,Whether you want a classic Chicago dog a Burger shake fries onion rings this place got it all.,1
1692,"How can you mess up a hot dog in Chicago AND when it’s part of your name?!
Well they did it twice in one night for me!!The first hot dog I ordered with everything (Chicago style!) the bun was hard—like actually dried out hard on one side, while the thinner piece of the bun was steamed and moist. The hot dog itself wasn’t even hot and was tight with over cooked skin! Like how, when they’re churning out dogs all day long?!?! I took one bite and then brought it back up to the counter. I chalked it up to a bad dog.
The lady behind the counter, told me that I could toss it, and she would get me another one. I waited maybe 5 min before she then handed me another hot dog. And guess what? Same fricking thing!!! I was just over this! I wasn’t going to go back a 3rd time. So I ate a half soggy, over cooked  hot dog from Portillo’s. It was the worst hot dog and the last one I’ll ever eat from here. Lost a long time fan.",0
1693,"I don’t understand all those good reviews! Even if the food was as good as advertised, This place Has the worst customer service I’ve ever seen !!!!!
They made mistakes in many orders While We were waiting for ours. Once we Got The order, they made us wait 15 minutes to get the cokes for NO reason at all !!! The manager came in to give us the drinks. People were Mad, neither the manager nor the person handing the food cared! We then noticed our order was missing Two burgers. We let the server know, we were told it’s been taken care of. We then waited 25 minutes, still no burgers! Then the same server just said they won’t prépare the burgers. Again ! WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Go try Chicago classics somewhere else !!!",0
1694,"Very good food . One area they need to improve is in making sure the order is correct and packed correctly before delivery.
I have ordered a few times and had food items that I paid for missing. Whoever is doing the quality check on the orders is not doing a good job.I highly recommend you check your order and receipt  before you receive/ accept. your order.",0
1695,"This is definitely a must try Chicago restaurant. An extensive menu of dogs, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, and salads. Beer is available but they had no wine available the day we were here. The Italian beef sandwich was the best I’ve had since being in Chicago the past week.",1
1696,"From starting out as a tiny hot dog hut in the 60's to what seems to be a food empire, this place is a MUST for both Chicago natives and visitors alike. The ambiance is a hybrid between Cracker Barrel and New Orleans and the food is fantastic. I'll warn though, the price may put off some individuals looking for cheap eats but it's SO worth it.",1
1697,"I think the ultimate thing to order at Portillo‘s is a Chicago style hot dog, an Italian Beef sandwich with peppers, fries, with cheese dipping sauce. You’ll be hella stuffed after all that, but you’ll be happy.

Also, their desserts are actually really good.

TIP: The patio has been my favorite place to sit. If you can grab a table, it’s a great quick enjoyable meal.",1
1698,"The most chaotic, confusing dining experience ever!

Ordered garden dog, Italian beef bowl, garden salad, in cafeteria line. Cashier pointed to pickup northeast.

At northeast pickup, sent to west pickup, where they are calling numbers out of order. Discovered salads are from north pickup station, and got it there. But then was told hot food is at west pickup station. Finally, number got called out.

Food was good. For first time visitors, the pickup stations are so busy, they don't explain.",0
1699,"This place was just ok for me, very crowded, dirty not kept up, the hotdogs were basic. I would not come again.",1
1700,"Good old Chicago staple, tastes just as good as it always has through the years. Downside is the line. Line was quite long so we ordered through online since the estimated wait time showed 15min. We ended up waiting 45min for 1 hot dog..because the staff wasn't paying attention to the online/pickup orders. Inefficient and frustrating.",1
1701,I ate here three times. Had to keep trying everything they had. It was all excellent even if the wait could be a bit much some time. It was the tastes of Chicago I wanted for a short visit. For sure touristy but Def saw locals too.,1
1702,Well the order taker wasnt knowledgeable about anything. My friend ordered a hot dog of some sort I ordered the spaghetti with a meatball side. It took a long time for her got dog then I waited for awhile after that and then asked about my order. That's when I was informed that you pick spaghetti up at a different window. So I retrieved my spaghetti and meatballs. It was good for American made. there was no authentic flavor in it at all. I realized I didn't get my drink. So I went back to the counter and they said I have to go to the hot dog counter to get that. Needless to say after the horrible way they threw food out there I did not get my drink. Would not recommend it at all.,0
1703,"Bad management , I had to get a refund after 1 hour waiting for the food , they make the food orders that are easy first , if You order a big order for like 3 people they leave to the end.
I had order number 204 and they were already serving order 316 .
And no answer about my order.

Good management makes sure first order come out first .

Sorry for the comment , do better please, people don't deserve to be treated like that.",0
1704,"Foods cool. Been to various locations over the years when in town, but made the mistake of going on Independence Day wknd this time. :(  I got food. It was a 2.5 hour event roughly, for 1 person mind you. Made friends while in line. So there's that.
Food is good tho. But be patient. Still stop by if you can.",1
1705,"I can't say 'YUCK' fast enough. We both had the garden dog which tasted like a rolled up piece of bologna. No snap, no taste even the pickle lacked crunch.
Then we tried the tasteless Italian beef, hot peppers couldn't revive this sandwich.
The salad was just Okay. They do give u a lot of salad dressing.
Finally, the famous chocolate cake, nothing extra or memorable about this either.
Such an expensive waste of money.",0
1706,"Our experience there wasn’t great at all. They got my order wrong. The food took very long to prepare and servers giving out order just made snarky comments about customers when they just wanted to know if their order had been done or not. We also made the mistake of going on a Saturday night at 7pm so this was peak hours but our expectations were just too high. Also, we were really a excited about the cake shake but it was nothing like what we imagined.",0
1707,"Friendly staff and service. The food was good, I just don't see what the hype is all about. We even tried their famous milkshakes, but they tasted the same to me as any other place. Price was fair, considering the location.",1
1708,"We used delivery from Portillo’s, and we ordered jumbo hot dog, jumbo chili dog, Italian beef sandwich, chocolate cake, chocolate cake milk shake and onion rings. The veggie added in the hot dog makes it lighter and more refreshing. Although we didn’t like pickle in general, pickle combined with all other ingredients in the hot dog really tasted better. Chocolate cake shake was one of the most evil dishes I could ever imagine - they used the whole chocolate cake in the shake. It’s too sweet & almost feeling like getting a heart attack, but it’s an interesting idea. Italian beef was not that good - maybe because of the delivery process, the bread got wet.",1
1709,"Ordered the Italian Big Beef sandwich dipped and the Chocolate Cake Shake. The ""big"" beef didnt have a lot of meat and what meat we did get was very dry. The bread and gravy tasted good. The biggest disappointment was the chocolate cake shake. It was supposed to have bits of cake and frosting within the shake. What we got was a chocolate shake that tastes just like Wendy's $1 frosty. Save your money and go elsewhere.",0
1710,"Fun, campy atmosphere. The Italian Beef Sandwich is awesome!",1
1711,"The hot dog was really good but the facility wasn't. Ketchup and food on the floor, table were unclean and etc. Nasty is the word....they need to create a cleaning routine especially with people coming in and out nationwide to prevent falls and most of all sickness. Please do better you all have good food.",1
1712,The food was amazing! Great service.,1
1713,Great food! One of the best things we ate while in Chicago.,1
1714,Beef Sandwich and Hotdog were very good. Prices are okay.,1
1715,"Nice service and interesting setting and decor, but the Italian beef was not good. I took two bites and threw the rest away. Granted, I hate Philly cheese steaks so maybe the Italian beef was good but not my style (I've added an extra star to offset my bias).",1
1716,Can’t get more trad Chicago than dogs served in a street food centre. Beware they’re piping hot! Great value and tap beers available. Saves the long trip to Weiner Circle and the dogs are great!,1
1717,"A little chaotic at first, not sure if someone seats you or what.  The dogs were great, the burger was really good.  Not a place where ill be lining up for round 2, but certainly happy I went for round 1.",1
1718,I got a dipped Italian beef Sandwich with sweet peppers and mozzarella cheese. I honestly didn’t really taste the cheese on the sandwich. I expected it to be melty and goey and it wasn’t. The beef was really good and the sauce was too. But there was maybe 2 sweet peppers and that’s it. Not worth the 9 dollars. I ate it in 4 bites.,1
1719,"Soggy hot dog
Long lines.
The servers seemed confused on filling orders.
Needs better management.",1
1720,The Italian beef sandwich was pretty good and the fries were fine. But my on-line order was supposed to be ready in 10 minutes—it took half an hour and one proactive and very friendly staff member to actually get me my food.,1
1721,"You can't come to Chicago and not stop in at Portillo's. I always get my usual - Italian Beef/Sausage combo with cheese fries. My wife enjoys the hot dogs more than the Italian Beef, but she's starting to come around. Service can be iffy when they are busy, but it's usually not too bad. Getting beer can also be problematic sometimes.",1
1722,"I am flabbergasted and in awe at the pace, efficiency, and unassuming quality they deliver.  Was that the best hotdog I ever had?  Yes.  Was their Italian beef better than Da Beef or any Italian beef sandwich I've had?  Yes.  Do I love their cake shake and their chocolate cake?  Yes.  Did we wait almost 2 hours to get our food and was only able to sit down at a table through the kindness of a family waiting for an Uber?  Yes.  And would gladly wait in line again.  Right now.

Alas, We are back in Colorado and could no longer satiate our cravings.  Portillo's was easily one of the highlights of our recent visit to Chicago.  Our friends and I will be ordering from them soon as well as a couple other iconic places and have ourselves a feast honoring these favored foods as well as the relentless and remarkable people that make these culinary experiences possible.",1
1723,"We ordered for 6 people. Italian beef, two chili cheese dogs,  a plain hotdog, a Maxwell dog  and a Chicago dog. Fries Service , a couple soft drinks, two large shakes. Service was slow and seemingly unapologetic.  Our order got lost somehow. We were patient and waited over 30 mins before we inquired and learned our order hadn’t been received by the line prep. When we finally got it, it was correct however, all the dogs were seemingly smashed apparently not handled with very much care. Disappointing since this specific restaurant is reviewed as the best. It was our first time.

The beloved Chicago dog redemption came later at a little establishment near the art museum. We’ll try again sometime, I’m sure it was just an off day.",1
1724,"Poorly trained. Too much screwing off. Drive thru just can’t seem to get it together when putting food into bags- someone there can’t read. Because if they could read,  then they would of never left the meatball sub out. McDonald’s gets it right. You don’t. Went back got a refund.",0
1725,People consistently overrate Portillos. They're Italian beef shouldn't even be in the ranking. I've eaten here since a kid and they have decent food but nowhere near the best in Chicago.,0
1726,Amazing! We ordered food to go back to our hotel one block away. We ordered Chicago dogs and Maxwell polish sausage and cheese fries. Everything was amazing. Everyone at the restaurant was super nice and helpful. Definitely a place to try if you’re ever in town!,1
1727,"Chicago is full of small restaurants and chains that mimic this menu and style of food, and with good reason. Get the burger, dogs, tamales, cake, shakes, cheese fries, and onion rings. This chain is very consistent, this location performs as well as the others in my experience.",1
1728,"It’s the classic River North Portillo’s. If you’re from out of town and want a good Chicago-tourist style food place then this is your best bet.

Only drawback is that it is so, so crowded during peak hours on the weekend- staff gets through you as fast as you can, but lines will sometimes start going around the block.",1
1729,"Cheap food, quick, the service is horrible. Waited 20 mins for something I apparently had to go to the other counter for but nobody informed me. The pasta is basic, and honestly simple. Nothing too crazy here. The hotdogs taste like nothing crazy either, and they are small
You can buy an 8 pack of dogs at a grocery store for the price of one of these.",0
1730,"If you are a visitor to chicago, you have to go to this place at least once to try a real Chicago hot dog or Italian beef. Get the jumbo dog which isn't so enormous and you have a very satisfying lunch. Yes, the place is crowded at lunch time but the line moves fast and the whole thing is really an experience that you don't want to miss.",1
1731,"food was great. online order pickup experience was awful. i waited at the restaurant for 40min after my pickup time. there were no employees at the counter i could ask to see if there was a problem with my order, just a sign that said ""orders will be placed on shelf when ready"". when i did manage to catch someone they were dismissive and told me to read the sign. finally i got my food and asked what the issue was, they said they're really backed up. ok, it's busy so there's a longer wait, i get it. but in that case portillo's should not be sending me a confirmation email saying my food will be ready in 10min. or at least, having any communication other than ""read the sign"" would have been nice.",0
1732,"A fun experience, it is late night fastfood. They serve a wide range of foods from hotdogs to pizza. The lines can get a little long later at night but the food comes up fast. Definitely stop here for a late night Chicago dog though.",1
1733,"Staff seems unhappy and stressed. Food was a good price but not great quality. The chili was raw onions in sauce, fries under cooked and the buns soggy. The main eating area is dirty with sticky floors and broken condiment dispensers only stocked with ketchup. Not a great Chicago showcase.",0
1734,"Only go there if you are a part of a group if you're a vegetarian like me, choices are a new plant based burger,  veggie dog, cafeteria style pasta and a Caesar salad. But the milk shake is great and the dog is made Chicago style. I usually go there with a group so it's great for that.

But I am sure the meat stuff is wonderful as the place is packed.",1
1735,"The French fries 🍟 are horrible but the Chicago style hotdog is decent. The cake shake is bland but edible. The straw used on the cake 🎂 shake is useless. I hate when restaurants serve shakes with soda 🥤 straws. I had to take my lid off the container and eat my shake with a spoon.

You will feel find bringing your kids to this restaurant because they have plenty of seating and it's a noisy environment. There's also an Elevator to access the seating on the 2nd level.",1
1736,"Ordered hot dogs and onion rings and $42 worth of food for lunch. Soggy buns, wrong stuff on my hot dog, I have to have mustard and ketchup, none on my food or in the bags as I ordered, didn't give me my side of peppers and so on. This is my first time ordering here. Called the store, can't get through, called customer service who transferred me to the Guest Service as a Manager wouldn't answer then Customer Care sent me back to the original number that doesn't answer. I am looking at cold soggy hot dogs and hard onion rings that I can't eat. Will never order from here again. Very disappointing.",0
1737,"Best hotdog's ever. This place has everything you need. Italian beef sandwiches, French fries, onion rings and the best item is a chocolate cake shake! They are amazing 😍",1
1738,The polish dog was just excellent! Great stop for a quick bite.,1
1739,"Tasty food but chaotic!
I know it's Brits love to queue but...
Wait in line to pay,  wait in line to pick up a drink and then get sent to another line to wait for pasta!!!
Once I got my food it was very tasty and lots of it.",1
1740,"This is a must have when visiting Chicago.
I've rated low in service because it is fast food style place. Other than that, they're very efficient managing a huge amount of customers with very fast serving.",1
1741,We love this place.  The beef combo sandwich is the best. The burger and fries are great as well.  Busy place but the get your food out pretty fast.,1
1742,"I heard it was pretty popular and known for there Italian beef. MY friend ordered a combination. The meat was nice and tender, all the fixing but average over all.",1
1743,"We went to Portillos for an authentic Chicago dog. The long lines made us believe we were on the right track. Even online publications indicated that this was the spot. Although their menu is extensive , we limited ourselves to the dogs, so that is the only thing i can speak to and it was definitely a let down. Mine was missing the sport peppers and overall they were soggy with very little flavor. None of the ingredients stood out, and every Chicago dog I have had from anywhere else was better than this one. I imagine their cheap prices and beer is what makes them popular and other items on the menu may be just fine, but for an authentic Chichago dog, I would recommend anywhere else.",1
1744,"At peak time/lunch, there is a long but moving queue for the food and guess what.. It was worth it. Now go ahead and give it a try.",1
1745,"It's Portillo's. It's going to be exactly what you expect. The line is efficient, if not quick. The food is traditional Chicago tourist fare, for a price that isn't cheap but doesn't feel quite like they're robbing you.

Came away with mixed feelings, but a wallet that wasn't terribly light. You can get beer too, so that's nice.",1
1746,"Good combination of flavours on the hot dogs, but they come soggy and cold. I had to make a second visit just to be sure it wasn’t a one off and it seems that is just the way they come. I genuinely don’t know what the fuss is about ..",0
1747,"Drove the company van and Picked up the  order for the office, had to wait over 25 minutes beyond the time order should have been ready. Got back to the office and come to find out we had 3 missing items.
I called the number to let them know but no one was available to answer.
I had to call several times, ended up calling again and selecting the catering menu, that was the only way I could speak to someone live.
Super bad experience. Some people also said the fries were cold and too salty.",0
1748,Open late. Great food. Nothing beats an Italian Beef Sandwich.,1
1749,They have best best best Chicago style Hot Dogs! You guys have to visit this place! Absolutely in love with this place. Me and my wife can't wait to come back. Staff is kinda and everything is clean. Amazing experience. I'm so happy I visited Portillo's. And guys don't forget to get a hot chocolate,1
1750,So good. So friendly. Want to be there every day!!,1
1751,"Took my family here to show them one the the flagstone stores, but the experience was bad. They lost our order and it took 45 minutes to ultimately get our food. I had to run down the block to refeed the meter another $6.00 due to the delay. Also, the tables and chairs were filthy as was the restroom! The food was up to standard, but everything else was bad. Unfortunately, we will not be going here again!",0
1752,"This is why i came to Chicago.
In fact everyone must come to Chicago just for Portillo’s.

We went to the Ontario Street location at night and it was fully packed and they had two long lines but it was moving really fast. The staff was incredible. They got one order wrong but they fixed it so quickly even before we could finish the previous sandwich.

I got the Italian beef sandwich dipped with extra hot peppers and hubby got the hot dog with all toppings. We also got the strawberry lemon cake shake.

Both were exceptionally tasty.

But nothing can beat the Italian Beef sandwich. It literally changed our lives. The beef was so moist and so soft that I didn’t even need to chew, it just vanished. The flavor was on point, hot, juicy and right amount of spicy from the peppers. Getting it dipped made it even more legendary. Trust me you would always want the bread wet from all that beefy goodness.

Even the cake shake was really delicious which we really couldn’t finish completely as it was huge.

A really must try when in Chicago. If i ever move here, i am going to find an apartment on Ontario Street definitely!",1
1753,My order took 40 minutes. I was there showing some friends Chicago for th first time and some of the best food places. My order was #209 theirs was #210. They got their food first and was finished eating by the time I complained several times to speak to a manager to find my order. Too many unenergized minorities clustered there doing nothing.,0
1754,"We ordered just one milkshale for dessert. It took them twenty minutes to make it. It wasn't even crowded... that's ridiculous.

The straws are too narrow to consume the milk shakes.

Staff doesn't listen during orders and blames you when you notice wrong items in the order.

They only get two stars because they accidently gave us the wrong order and so we additionally received three hot dogs for free 🙃",0
1755,We love this location!! We go through the drive thru 2-3 times a month!! We get the charbroiled chicken sandwich with cheddar cheese/bacon only and it's always hot and delicious!!! We definitely recommend it!!!!,1
1756,The food is delicious. Probably one of the best hot dogs I have had. However when it is busy getting your food from the pick up area is hectic.,1
1757,My order wasn’t correct. Normally come to this location but this particular time the order wasn’t correct and I ended paying almost $20 on just myself. Now the person who taken my order repeated my order correctly. I get my food and it was incorrect. I’m not sure what happened but please double check with the pattern. Food quality was less than normal. Like I said I get food from here regularly,1
1758,"Not worth the massive wait and chaos. Service was absurdly disorganized, and cashiers couldn't seem to properly ring up orders. They've failed to scale up to meet demand. Cake shakes were definitely a highlight but still not worth the aggravation.",0
1759,I was disappointed with the food. The restaurant is nice.,1
1760,A must to try Chicago’s hot dog and Portillo is great choice. The inside is very cozy. They even have a second floor. You can order at the counter and pick up at the next counter. It runs like a fast food place.,1
1761,Portillo’s never disappoints. I wanted my bf to try the hot dog and we washed it down with a cold beer in a frosted glass. I wanted fries (which are outstanding) but we were eating dinner in an hour- next time!,1
1762,Fluffy strongly recomanded so I had to check out the chocolate cake shake when I visited chicago. The shake and the jumbo dog are good but less than I expected. Still worth a visit.,1
1763,"Portillo's Hot Dogs is not just dogs. Growing up in Chicagoland gives access to many Chicago Hot Dog joints. With that said, today I was craving the combo... Italian beef and sausage, dipped along with cheese and combo peppers. Hungry, I was not disappointed. Sandwich is a double hander, packed with meats and flavor. Dipped gives just the right amount of au jus. Grab a side of fries or onion rings, fountain drink, beer or the Chocolate cake Milkshake. Aside from long wait at the beer station (10 minutes), this location has food timing down, 7  minutes from order to pick-up. Not too shabby Portillo's, keep it up!",1
1764,"Italian beef dipped with extra gravy sauce topped with sweet peppers. 10/10. Can't go wrong with a chocolate cake shake, you know you want it! 🤌",1
1765,"Only had a few minutes to get something to eat but figured I would try my luck and see if I could get in and out quick.

I walked in and luckily the line wasn't very long (thank you pandemic). I was debating on what to get and the cashier recommended the beef and polish sandwich. I went with her recommendation and was very glad that I did. I can't imagine anything tasting any better.

Great sandwich and great service!",1
1766,"Used to love getting Italian beef, au jus, and buns in catering to take home for a feast. Now they skimp so bad on the au jus that there is not enough for all the sandwiches. On Tuesday, they messed up my hot dog. Just not the same place I remember.",0
1767,The atmosphere in this place is really cool.  The line was long and it took a while to order and get our food.  The food was good and there are a bunch of different options to chose from.  Finding a seat is a bit of a challenge.,1
1768,"This hot dog was incredible. As someone who is just a ketchup and onion guy, this hot dog was outrageous. I had to take off the pickle because it was just too much. The actual hot dog was amazing. It had the natural casing, so you get a great crunch. The neon green relish, mustard, tomato combo was an awesome tangy contrast to the really meaty flavor from the actual dog. The bun was nice and steamed so it just melded everything together in a nice way. While I didn’t get a salad, the salad bar looked clean and stocked with fresh veggies so I wouldn’t hate it if someone brought me a salad. The whole era sets are cool, but I also don’t think more seating would be a better move. Awesome place and food here though!",1
1769,"Amazing hot dog. I tried their strawberry lemon cake shake, chocolate cake, and baked mostaccioli also. Those were ok, but I should just stick with their portillo’s beef hot dog. It was so good. I will be trying their maxwelp street polish dog also since this is my second visit In two days. Good price for the amount of food too. I am also going to try their fries today.",1
1770,"The Italian beef sandwich, heavy dip with Giardineira was TRANSFORMATIVE! Beats LA's Phillippe 's by a factor of 10. The cake shake was amazing... and don't pass up a chance to have a cheeseburger (above average in freshness and taste). This place is always busy, so expect a wait for your food.",1
1771,Was quite happy with the sausage and onion rings but that chocolate cake shake was wonderful! Will definitely return on my next trip to Chicago.,1
1772,"Loved the ambiance and decoration of the place. I personally found it difficult to figure out where and how order. The food was delicious starting from the hot dog, the curly fries and the chocolate cake. If you’re visiting Chicago definitely a must.",1
1773,"We tried the original Chicago dog, the Maxwell street polish, and the chocolate cake shake! Everything is exactly what all the reviews say :) quick, fast service and good food.",1
1774,"We did both a dine in & carry out. Classic Chicago dogs & fries inside and Italian beef for eight as carry out.

Both are absolutely wonderful!",1
1775,"Try everything on the menu, you won’t be disappointed.",1
1776,The service was great and I like that it was a quick place to grab a bite to eat. It was like cafeteria style get your food on a tray and grab a seat. I wasn't that big on the salad I had(yeah I know.. This isn't a salad place.) the Chicago style hot dogs were good though. It seems to be a pretty popular place though.,1
1777,"This place can drastically improve their service by adding digital sign on top of pick up counter as well all around the dining area especially upstairs but refuse.
Pretty sure customers have already mentioned it to management. They currently use a walkie talkie that's connected to what I believe is a bullhorn speaker which is uncomprehandable .",0
1778,"Its aight. This one is very touristy and kinda dingy but if youre looking for a crazy calorie laden meal Chicago style (or at least a touristy version of it) it works.

They will also charge you more for chicken breast in your Ceasars salad. Which is insane to me given other places just....give you the chicken?",1
1779,"It was a cool place to go to... but more of an experience than ""great food""

The service was great.  But, over all, the food was just normal.

Would recommend going, but go with the right expectations.",1
1780,"Most overrated hot dog in the city.
Ribs are like a flavorless mcrib sandwich left out in a puddle for 3 days.

The only things that are good here are desserts",0
1781,Always a great place to have a delicious meal!!,1
1782,Super long line. 45 minutes for a hotdog. Bun was soggy. Nothing special about this place. Extremely dirty. Tables were icky and trash was overflowing onto the floor. Tourist trap only.,0
1783,"If you've never had an Italian Beef sandwich, then get yourself to Portillo's and discover what you've been missing. This is a Chicago institution and almost always busy, but the food is sooooo worth the wait.",1
1784,"The atmosphere at Potillo's is pretty cool. The food is good as well. If ever in Chicago, this is a must visit place on your list.",1
1785,"It's Portillo's, a place where all your micronutrient dreams can come true.  The Italian beef is tasty as advertised and there's a whole menu of Chicago favorites.  If you can spare the calories, indulge in some nostalgia.  It's also worth noting that the patrons make this place an experience.  If you're an out-of-towner, stay for the overheard bon mots, turns-of-phrase, and local chatter.",1
1786,"Great place. A touch of Chicago for a very very decent price.
Pasta, ribs, cheeseburgers, etc... Everything is good. For a striking price.
The atmosphere is also unique.",1
1787,"I have to say , their hot dogs are good, although I’m not a huge fan of pickles (I took it out) 😂 . Portillos hot dogs are way much better than Byron’s as some people claim .",1
1788,"Got their famous hot dogs, first visit there. Very busy place... will go back on my next visit to Chicago ... love their decorations  inside and their photos of all the celebrities  who have been there..",1
1789,"Me and my friends wanted to get Portillo and when we went in all of the workers weren't on their phones. We had to wait 40 mins for food!!!! And they started making the food 35 mins into waiting. When it was served my fries were cold, and the rest of my food. I don’t recommend coming here after 9. Terrible service!",0
1790,"Walked thirty minutes to get the kids Portilo’s and the young lady at the front register had the worst attitude I have encountered maybe in my life she was horrible , so bad I actually had to take the kids and leave. The biggest let down of our night and our trip and I could not believe someone like this is representing this brand.  I Have employees and I would not tolerate this I recommend not going to Portilo’s skip this spot if you want to maintain positive vibes it is horrible!",0
1791,"Food so damn good, I miss Chicago",1
1792,"Took almost 2 hours to get food ordered on Uber Eats. Had missing items, food was cold. Not worth for the price. 10/10 would not recommend.

Had to reedit and add more this short cake is so disappointing looks old",0
1793,Definitely some good hot dogs. Love their fries!,1
1794,"It took 40-45 minutes for two beefs, 1 hot dog and a salad to be ready, to go order. They kept losing the order and made we wait. After about 25 minutes I let them know and they said they went to make the order but it took Another 15 minutes. Very a slow service.",0
1795,Great experience as always. Me and my wife visited Chicago on 03/05/21 and ate here. We have been here multiple times before. The food was good and the #cakeshake🎂 is a must! A large shake will feed two adults and two children. Highly recommend.,1
1796,The place was slammed pack but we were able to get our Chicago style hot dogs and a seat quickly.  It was our first and only Chicago style hot dogs.  I believe it is an acquired taste. The chili dogs looked especially tasty.  Kind of wish I would tried those instead.  It was a unique experience and definitely a must when in Chicago.,1
1797,"Indeed, it has been one of the best Hamburgers I have had. The chocolate cake was so delicious and moist!",1
1798,"Good late night dining (though dine-in at this location stops around 11-11:30pm, after that it’s drive-through only).  All beef hot dog is a must.  Italian beef needs to be with “hot and sweet” peppers, and “wet” (dipped in jus), tasty and filling!  Fries are good too with chili and cheese sauce.",1
1799,"Great variety, decent prices, seasonal beer in iced cold glass",1
1800,"Food was as expected (a little disappointed compared to more local joints), but the customer service was abysmal. When asking clarifying questions about my order (something was missing), the workers proceeded to talk badly in front of me, and had no interest of trying to answer my question. It was an unfortunate experience since my hopes had been so high.",0
1801,"This place is huge inside, so much room, so many people. This is a clean restaurant, wait time to get the food isn't too long. I like how this place has different lines for different types of food. I, of course, got on the Chicago dog line. I'm from NY and if I tell you this hot dog is good, then you know it's good. I could have like four of these at one sitting, so delicious. I would come back here everytime I'm in Chicago.",1
1802,"This restaurant is very famous for the Chicago style hot dog!
Opens 11AM-11PM, so you can eat it until late night.(After closing near supermarket)

You can choose beef hot dog and jumbo dog!
Either hot dog is Chicago style, filled with vegetables!
It is true you do not need ketchup.",1
1803,"First time in Chicago and I had to try a hot beef sandwich! It was everything it was hyped up to be. I got mine with hot peppers and extra gravy, the SO got the Big beef dipped, as well as onion rings, 2 chili cheese dogs, Root beer and a vanilla malt shake.
Everything was exceptional except the chili cheese dogs. The chili tasted like old Hormel and the cheese was equally as bad. A majority of the malt was at the bottom of the shake. Aside from thise mishaps, this place is packed and the lunch crowd just keeps on coming. They had 3 lines opened so the process was pretty speedy. I loved my Italian Beef sandwich, the bread was still a little firm, the peppers, celery and carrots gave it good bite and the gravy was perfectly placed. The Big Beef sandwich was dipped so towards the end the sandwich became a sloppy mess. If you go I'd recommend the Italian Beef with extra gravy and a strawberry shake.
We went back again to take some sandwiches back home and they were just as delicious(ordered them dry and asked for a side of the gravy).
The place was clean and the service was amazing. I'd visit any location.",1
1804,"Traditional restaurant in Chicago. Definitely a go-to. Can't miss it if you are around!
Italian beef and  hot dogs are their specialty, but everything is great and worth to try.
Casual place with friendly staff.",1
1805,"Perfect location, nice staff and decent prices. The french fries taste like frozen french fries. The chocolate’s cake milkshake is yummy!",1
1806,Always the best - maybe a sacrilege but tried a garden dog this visit. Pretty good! You need to get a cake shake.,1
1807,"Very busy fast casual restaurant with yummy Chicago style hot dogs. You order at one counter then wait for food at the other, along with a crowd of other hungry people. You can watch them prepare the food. The decor is eclectic and there is a lot of hustle and bustle. Definitely an experience!",1
1808,"Based on a recommendation, we tried Portillo’s. We tried the Chicago dog, even though normally wouldn’t eat those toppings, and was impressed. Somehow it works. The fries were good but the shakes were better. There is a bit of confusion when ordering but the service was fast. Seating is limited due to the crowd. Definitely recommend!",1
1809,"I thought the servings would be bigger, and the place a bit homier, but it still was really good taste and value, especially on the cake shake.",1
1810,"One day they need to make it so when you're doing a review for a restaurant it's broken up into Stars for different things you're looking for when you go to a restaurant. Anyway I came here because it was recommended for my first Italian beef sandwich. Wow! I don't know if they make this better somewhere else but I have to say for my first time it was great! I would definitely return, but now from experience I have a better understanding of how this place works as far as ordering and getting your food. I suggest they have someone at the front door to greet people and ask them if they have been there before so they can tell them how it works. You first go into the restaurant and it kind of looks like a cafeteria, you go on  line to put in your order, the menu is spread out around the ordering area. This makes it hard to know what you want right away. The line can be short and very quickly get very long but the cashiers are very exceptional and the line moves very fast so try to have your order ready by the time you get to the register. I had a Italian beef sandwich with sausage combo and a chopped salad. Like I said very good food, the salad is a meal and itself, it has everything but the kitchen sink in it. Not a vegetarian salad and I loved it! After you put your order in you pick up your sandwiches in one place and your salad in another place. And they also have a separate line for online orders and Catering pick up. Enjoy the chaos but bring your family and have a great meal.",1
1811,Love Portillo’s but would avoid this location at all costs. Lost our order and took over 45 minutes. They made us pull into a gas station to wait for our food. Terribly unprofessional. Avoid.,0
1812,"Very busy location with surly service and fair food for the price. I recommend the hot dogs, but skip the ribs.

Was here on a very late night and had trouble ordering at the cashier due to her accent. The impatience shown by staff here is quite something else. Food itself was OK. The dog, cheesesteak and chicken burger were fine, the ribs were mediocre bordering on bad. This is fairly cheap food for this part of town. Note that if you order multiple items, because of the combination of stores they have here they may come from two different sides, so you should check your order before you leave.",1
1813,"This location is always on point : fast, accurate, and friendly. The entrance can be trick to get into if there is a wait so I recommend coming from the north heading south invade you need to wait before entering the drive through.",1
1814,Amazing food and great customer service!,1
1815,"The sausages was small the roll was all wet and soggy. Could not enjoy it.i don't understand all the fuss about Portillos, we had the beef sandwich after but it was not nice all wet and soggy we just ate the fries. Too much to wait, not expensive but it's not worth it.",0
1816,Went for Italian beef but honestly it’s just as good as anywhere else minus waiting 30min amongst a mob waiting for your food….then finding a table to sit and eat,1
1817,"Food was excellent, but the service was subpar. Granted it was busy, but when I finally got to asking about our food 40 minutes later, they had lost track and didn't even offer an apology!",1
1818,We decided to stop by after reading a couple reviews and to be honest it is overrated in my opinion. The hotdog was ok nothing crazy or special. The Italian beef was the only thing that was good the beef was very flavorful and juicy. If you are in the area give it a try not a must go when in Chicago.,0
1819,"Very cool location with delicious hotdogs! We tried the original, the chili dog, and the vanilla milkshake. All were delicious! They make the hotdogs in front of you which is fun to watch. The staff was very friendly and explained how to order and where to pick up based on what you ordered. Delicious we will be back!",1
1820,"Good beefs, great hotdogs, big beers, good fries. What more do you need? Add the awesome atmosphere and you have a winner.",1
1821,"Good food but they kept messing up the order. Ordered hot dog, fries, beef sandwich, drink and strawberry shortcake. The first time I picked up from counter, they didn't give me the drink. Opened up bag back at table and cake was missing too. Had to go back for that. Sigh. Maybe if they trained counter staff to slow down and process orders correctly, there'd be fewer mistakes. Large and busy (no, chaotic) with zero supervision. No manager in sight. That said, we really enjoyed the dog and sandwich.",1
1822,Best hot dogs in Chicago!!! The service was fast & friendly. We will eat at Portillo's every time we visit Chicago.,1
1823,"My friend Stephanie recommended this place and I had it on my bookmark since the moment she told me.

Because I was in the mood for a hotdog ( I’m always in the mood for hotdogs actually hahaha) I went straight to this place and oh my God I loved it.

It turns out you make a line to order.
While I was waiting to pay another guy came and started explaining to all of us waiting there,  how the process was and all the food that they had in that place.

As soon as I paid the nice lady at the cash register gave me the receipt and told me that I can fill out a survey to get free fries. So while it while I was waiting for my order, I filled out the survey and I got a code to get my free fries.

As soon as they call my number I when I pick up my hotdogs and I asked for the fries and they gave it to me right away.

The organization of this place was awesome and the decoration was even better. Everyone was working with a smile on your face and really nice.

The taste of those hotdogs was extremely good and I wish I could have more and more and more.

I wish they open one location here in Miami where I live.",1
1824,"Portillo's never disappoints. Since moving away from Chicago, I still try to come up once a year and Portillo's is always my first stop.  I get the same thing every time and it's always great.",1
1825,"Visiting Chicago? Then you need to have a Chicago Dog at Portillos. The hot dogs and fries were great. It was very busy but the staff was friendly and helpful, we will come back again.",1
1826,Is it wrong to attribute divinity to a hot dog? I hope not because this is the descriptor I would use for the greatness of Portillo’s. I had a proper Chicago dog with no ketchup! I really wanted another one but saved room for a slice of chocolate cake. Apparently they are the number 1 fast casual restaurant in the country and you will get no argument from me.,1
1827,Delicious the hot dogs are great and the Italian beef is crazy good. If you visit Chicago it's a must stop.,1
1828,First time trying Portillo's and it was the last stop on my trip before heading back to NY. I'm used to having hot dogs with just ketchup but this was a game changer. All the toppings on it were delicious and their crinkle fries are perfect. Definitely make a stop here if you're traveling through. Get the works!,1
1829,nice place to try Chicago-style hotdog,1
1830,Fantastic first experience here. Went with their namesake hotdog and it was the right choice. Fresh toppings and flavorful dog.,1
1831,"Excellent Chicago style hotdogs and a fun atmosphere. Dont go during busy hours, you will wait 30+mins for food.",1
1832,"The service was absolutely disgusting. The ladies at the cashier looked so bored, mad and rude. Idk if its bcz i was wearing a hijab or if all the workers were annoyed, but they all gave a rude attitude. No one was there to clean the tables. The place was a mess.",0
1833,"First time having a Hot Dog in Chicago (aka Chicago Dog) went to this popular joint. Expect a que both for ordering and picking up food. The dog was good, beef w/natural casing(?) Pickle, relish, peppers, mustard, poppy seed bun. I'd go back but maybe order ahead?",1
1834,"""A must go to if you visit Chicago!"" The Food is delicious! I was really impressed.  Great service   customer service!! PORTILLOS in Arizona don't compare food/customer service!!",1
1835,"The building is quite large with a prominent signboard making the impression of inviting anyone to be able to come there. No need to dress up luxuriously or order in advance. Typical of a fast food restaurant. In the parking lot, I saw many cars that were still on both sides of the restaurant. Several cars were seen queuing in the drive thru section. there are also three men who are smoking near a large ashtray beside the restaurant, while occasionally looking inward, maybe a sign that he is a visitor in the same restaurant.

When we’re inside, the aroma and the warm atmosphere ambushed into both of our senses. I even hummed the songs they played. Those are 80s songs! It was like time machine and brought you into the era of Duran-Duran, Air Supply, to Jackson Five’s era.

The tables are also quite relaxed. Adjacent, but not crowded. Warm, but does not look pushy. Designed with red and white square, probably a standard unit for Portillo. Not too loud music makes visitors comfortable to talk, while there is still a loud laugh can be heard.

The menu choices on display are also simple. Strikingly colorful, but still with one theme. There are sections for burgers, salads, and beer that can be enjoyed by visitors. For operational reasons, only the first floor remains open until one o'clock in the morning. But that is not a problem, because the chair you want to occupy can be easily found. We chose a table near the window.

Mentioning the name of Portillo's, it means you are like being ready to be in a room with a true Chicago treat. For people who are trying it for the first time like me, this is a sign that we will be faced with several menu choices that want to be tried immediately. Without thinking twice, we chose their ultimate menu, hot dogs.

While waiting for the order, I circled my eyes to the whole room. Many frames or memorabilia hung on the walls that were deliberately made without the use of coatings, there were only red bricks there. Neat.

The visitors who came were mostly 25-50ish, employees who had just returned from work, and old partners. This is not a place for small families, because there is no baby chair there. My guess is, if I arrive early, then I won't get a place on this ground floor, because many people will fulfill it.

When the hot dog reached my hand, it was a plain hot dog, in a good way. There was no sauce, mustard, or mayonnaise between the piles of vegetables, pickles and soft bread that was still warm. The employees said the sauce and mustard would destroy the hot dog taste. A glass of coke is the perfect complement.

The smell of warmed bread can still be felt even though I have finished eating it. I want to try a combination of hot dogs, salads, and local beer that is sold there, with other friends, one day. Because of the bus arrival schedule, we finished the remaining food in hurry.

Finally, I asked permission to go to the lavatory to check -it was my habit to check the cleanliness of a restaurant- the hygiene, which was located on the second floor, and as you might guess, I had to use the elevator, which was quite annoying. But that feeling is then gone, because the state of the restroom is clean, and friendly to disabled visitors. Toilet paper uses two rolls, not just one. Hand sanitizers are also placed near the sink. Interestingly, there is no smell of urine or strong odor typical of fast food restaurants. I say thank you to the janitor.

My experience in Portillo is still cloudy due to time constraints. But I convinced myself to go back to exploring each menu, tasting every aroma of food served, and also the local beer that I had not had time to try. As an exchange student living in Illinois, at least I need to know a cool place to hang out, with friendly prices, open late into the night, and an easily accessible location when in downtown. Portillo's answered all my wishes.

Portillo’s is like being made when you miss a gathering place with people you choose to share stories, when away from home.",1
1836,I rather smoke C r a c k then ever deal with this location again. Burning currency is a better way to spend money then spending it here. The number you call to attempt to get a refund. Send you to the F U C K off department.,1
1837,"Good food but I think it's a little over rated. I had Portillo's small hot dog it wasn't bad and beef italian and sausage combo it was average.
The staff members were rude and the lady who took my order got aggravated because I was asking about the menu being my first time at the place.",1
1838,"JC One Liner Review:  This is Chicago’s In-n-out.

The Italian beef sandwich is a must-try.  The burger was so-so, but the sandwich rocked it.

The inside decor is pretty amazing too. Come check it out if you are a sandwich or a hotdog lover.",1
1839,"I was told by several cabbies that Portillo’s was not the best place in Chicago for a hotdog, but that it was good. Boy, I thought it was great for a Chicago dog. The crisp of the hog dog with a bevy of vegetables specifically that beautiful looking pickle. Complemented by a super cold beer, this was quite the meal. The place had long lines but they moved fast. While the place seems very inefficient and out of order, there seems to be a science behind how they service customers.",1

1841,"Great Chicago dogs, malts we're thick and delicious, and chicken tenders were crispy and fresh. Lots of seating and they even have a beer section.",1
1842,It was very confusing where to order. My sister and I placed orders at the same time and hers came out 25 minutes before mine. The Chicago dog was great but the Italian beef had no flavor and was very dry.,1
1843,"The real Chicago-style hot dog!
Wide selection of hot dogs, hamburgers, fried foods, but also salads, pasta dishes and desserts, at affordable prices.
The location is in typical American style with neon, signs, hanging vintage car and checked tablecloths.
Friendly and helpful staff, fast service.",1
1844,"Took an hour to order and receive food, but it was worth the wait. Great vegab hot dogs!",1
1845,I must admit the portillo's hot dog was super good. Everybody in Chicago kept saying go there and it was worth it in taste and on price. The inside was nice too. They also have a patio but I couldn't go up because capacity limit was reached. I will return on my next trip.,1
1846,"This place is extremely legit. I greatly appreciate this restaurant being open and operational during the Covid-19 pandemic.  They had their system working like a fine patek watch. Hot dogs were outstanding and milk shakes were terrific, I highly recommend.",1
1847,Delicious. First time visiting.  Had an all beef with everything and an polish sausage. Future visits to Chicago will require me going through the rest of the menu.,1
1848,Food was good but not great. Ordering the food was a process but overall the experience of the iconic place was different in a good way for being in a new city.  In my opinion it is the perfect example of a well deserved tourist trap with a business model that works for the owners in a city that attracts a lot of tourists.  The ambiance is what and reputation is what should attract them but the the was sub-par!,1
1849,"Delicious! Probably the best hot dog I ever had. Long line, but moves fast! I absolutely adore the decor! something new everywhere you look! They are taking great measures with Covid. Just get two hotdogs! Skip the fries and cheese sauce.",1
1850,Highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  When we first walked in the line was a bit of a concern but this place knows how to keep things moving.  There was a lot more choices than I had imagined but we stuck with the standards for our first visit.  The high recommendations were not high enough.  Everything was so much better than I imagined. Will definitely be coming back next time I am in Chicago.,1
1851,"Lots of quality fast food choices, Chicago style all the way, reminiscent of ball park culture of infamous hot dogs, burgers, salads, sandwiches, whitefish sandwiches, fries, soda, beer, wine and more. Loved my portillo hot dog, all beef, served with onions, peppers, tomato, pickle. Get 2 or a jumbo, but they are so smooth and tasty on poppyseed buns, it's hard to just eat one...",1
1852,"A must stop for a newbie to Chicago. It was affordable and delicious. It's crowded, but like other reviews mention the line goes pretty quickly. I like the beef Italian combo that was recommend in other reviews, just order like a local and you will enjoy every bite!",1
1853,"Great food, loved the environment and music. The burger was great but the edges were charred a lot and a little dry with lots of lettuce, the hot dog was great but was super loaded. The chocolate cake shake is so good and received a free piece of chocolate cake for filling a survey (ask for a survey where u receive ur order, fill it online and receive a shake, chocolate cake or fries for free). The cake was moist and the frosting was super sweet.

I wish they put a digital screen to get to know your order instead of waiting for someone to call it. Food isn't served by the order number, so you better listen carefully when they call out numbers. I waited almost 20 mins for my order.",1
1854,"You must try hot dog if you one to Chicago! The best hot dog I have ate!
Very interesting restaurant ~ funny deco and music!
I will come back next visiting!",1
1855,"Incredible must visit while in the city! Namesake dog is delicious, gotta love that poppyseed bun and topping combo. Dog has a nice snap too it and the crinkle cut fries pair well. Clean bathroom. Atmosphere was lively with great old timey music and relics. A bit crowded so don't be surprised if there's a wait, but it's totally worth it!",1
1856,"One of those must go restaurants while in Chicago. Street food well done. Italian sandwiches are great and you can have a great dessert by asking for a cake shake. Trust me, you'll love your dessert!",1
1857,Chicago style pizza is overrated. This is not! Portillo's hot dogs are the best.,1
1858,Not a functional restaurant.  Waited 45 minutes for 2 hot dogs.  Order was wrong.  Refused to wait longer. Place was a disaster - absolutely do not go here.,0
1859,"The staff friendly with with welcome, it has variations of fast food, pasta, or salad. It has also bar.
Seating areal can be on lower level or upper level.
The price is great, it does delivery, drive through, or order by some app that available on play store.",1
1860,"I can't believe I've NEVER had Portillo's in all my trips to Chicago. I have now been happily initiated. That Chicago dog is good, but the Char Grilled Maxwell Street Polish Sausage is amazing 🔥💯😍",1
1861,"Portillo's was a great experience! Food was great and atmosphere was awesome! This place has a lot of sports history and is unique just to visit! We also had a gentleman draw a portrait of us after we ate! That was great! We rode our bikes here, and would recommend this place if you are in the area or just want venture out!",1
1862,"This was the best hot dog I have ever had in my life. I have never craved a hot dog before, but now that I'm back home in Texas, I can say I'd travel back to Chicago just to get another one of these. The hot Italian and the homemade chocolate cake we're great too, but nothing compares to a Portillos hotdog.",1
1863,Lived my chilli hot dog! Great environment and a must in your list when visiting chicago.,1
1864,It's hard to rate this place. We went on Fourth of July so I imagine it was busier than usual. The place was packed front to back. It's a little confusing if you had never been before. After waiting in line to order we waited to pick up our order. We waited in the wrong line. Didn't know dogs and burgers had a separate line. Found a seat up stairs and ate. The food was just okay for me the wife and our son. Could have given three stars if the ordering and pick up was easier.,0
1865,"Incredible place!  Everything was great.  It is a pity that at the time of my visit the second floor was not working.  the view is magnificent from there.  The atmosphere of the place, the decorations, the food - everything is very cool!  Recommend 100%!",1
1866,"Unfortunately I wasn’t impressed with this place. I came for a Chicago Hot dog to get the full experience and although it wasn’t nasty it wasn’t delicious either. I’m not sure if I had higher expectations and was let down. Also the “cheese fries” don’t come with cheese on them it’s on the side which I feel defeats the purpose if you didn’t order it Togo. There’s a very long line with no clear directions and the staff was too pleasant. Overall, I don’t think it’s worth the visit and wait.",1
1867,"A tourist attraction for Chicago style fast food. They have a couple of locations. very big organized w/ a lot of flashing Neon Lights prepared for big volumes of visitors but this was the biggest let down in taste I have encountered in the city. I tried 2 Flagship sandwiches1-the Chicago style hot dog: it had a tough shell around it that I never tasted in any hot dog in my life so that gets a zero from me,2- Italian beef which is the must try in Italian restaurants in Chicago was a mush of shredded beef, does not have the the look of texture of thinly sliced roast beef. Come and try other things on the menu that would be my advice.",0
1868,"I stopped in for lunch because I love getting Italian Beef Sandwiches when I'm in Chicago.  I had 2 on this trip, and at Portillo's, you can simply taste the quality.  Theirs is just delicious.  I also have to mention the gentleman that greets you as you enter the door is super nice.  He welcomes you and shows you where to order and pick up, etc.  Really friendly guy.  If you're driving, they have a double drive-thru with some additional girls out in the street to take your order as you're waiting in line.",1
1869,"My wife and I was visiting Chicago from Memphis TN and we absolutely love this place. Staff greeted and treated us like family. Being from Memphis we are BIG on hospitality. Everyone is usually friendly and down to earth. We definitely recommend. Food was great!!!! Even the French fries were the best I've ever tasted. We ordered the Italian beef and a Polish. Everything was FRESH and delicious. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Keep up the great service and thanks for the great food.",1
1870,"The cake is so moist and fresh like can't get enough of it. The regular chocolate shake is too little to suffice any man's need. But the my staple order include hotdog and onion rings. The hand breaded chicken sandwich is worth a shot as well. A word of advice a regular hotdog will you unsatisfied just go with jumbo. Just like ""Go big or Go Home"".",1
1871,"Great family place, food was good but nothing special. Food was served fast.",1
1872,"Best hot dogs in Chicago and possibly in the U.S. super tasty and not expensive. I loved the atmosphere of the place too, very authentic, a reminder of the 20s in Chicago. Also try the Italian beef sandwich.",1
1873,"Had high hopes for this. The ambiance is nice, an old style food court, and the wait was short. But it just tastes like a hot dog with pickle. The pickle is a little overpowering. Hot dog doesn’t doesn’t have the snap and the buns aren’t toasted. Was not bad but not a must try for me.",1
1874,"I went through the drive thru. This is the BEST PORTILLO’s I’ve ever visited. The food was fresh& delicious, the customer service was good& fast. WILL BE RETURNING!",1
1875,Was told to eat here by a representative at the hotel we are staying at. Glad I took their advice. Great meal for a decent price. I'm sure I'll end up eating here before I leave Chicago,1
1876,"Came here to try the chocolate cake shake ...its really good!! Must try 😊
Loved the Italian Beef and Sausage Combo 😋",1
1877,"There should be Portillo's in NY.
Walking in, it is a refreshing new atmosphere I have never experience before. There is no one waiting you. There are two floors full of nostalgic and vintage decor. Each piece clearly signifies a part of Chicago and it's people.
You order at the counter and wait til your name is called up. If you order different dishes, you would be called to the designated counter to recieve you food.
Despite not being a big fan of hotdogs, their famous hotdogs are a must try.
Staffs are friendly and helpful. The tables are clean. They use metal untesils instead of plastic!
Take out boxes are located by the dessert/custard area.",1
1878,When in Chicago where do you stop for a Chicago dog? Portillo‘s hotdogs is your place. Not only do they have amazing hotdogs but they also have other wonderful items on their menu. Love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Staff was very helpful while we were in line placing our order.  This place will be so worth your stop.,1
1879,Have you tried hot dog at portillo’s ? I’m so glad I ordered this delicious hot dog - it tastes so great. (chilli cheese dog served with onion was really delicious and char-grilled maxwell stree style polish not suggested filled with muatard sauce). I,1
1880,"Watched a video that called this ""a staple of Chicago dining"".....and now I see why. It's simple,  reasonably priced.....and amazing flavors!   What more do you need?",1
1881,Being a long standing Chicago food joint this place never disappoints. For the first time I ordered off the Wraps and Salad menu and it was worth it. It's almost Summer so I'm being cautious about what I put into my body. The Cobb Wrap was delicious with the vinaigrette. It wasn't busy at 6 p.m. which is probably the best time to come around. If you're strapped on time don't come during the lunch rush that can go well till 3 p.m. some days. It's a good place to eat and chill and take in the city. Bom dia.,1
1882,"Boy oh boy do I get excited about this meal every time I get to Chicago. It's iconic, delicious, and I feel like I need a shower afterwards... but it's worth it.
Get the sandwich dipped and if you're with others, grab a hotdog too...split it all and have a blast.",1
1883,"Never disappoints. The chocolate and seasonal (lemon, mint etc) cake shakes are amazing. And the breaded chicken croissant is a game changer.",1
1884,Amazing meat quality on the Maxwell hot dog. Second to none and I've had lots of hot dogs. It's not $5.50 good but worth a go and I wish they provided mustard not just ketchup :/,1
1885,"A great place to have a hearty meal. Started off with a great salad in the sweltering heat. Then moved to the Jumbo dog and finally the main item, the beef hoagie.
That is the highlight of this institution.
Always packed and always delivers a fantastic meal.
Consistency is still the same as it was 8yrs ago when we visited them then.

Staff needs to be credited to manage and deliver orders so well. Almost close to 100% accuracy in order delivery.",1
1886,Man..so good. This is a must try place especially this location. They have the most incredible foot. The Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers is the way to go. Can't wait to try other things next time I got. Absolutely delicious.,1
1887,"The place is always busy, so I expected that it would be when I went here. The place was really packed and the lines were moving slowly. The lines were long to the point that almost all of the people inside were in the line. I was in line and I waited for almost 30 minutes. Despite how busy the place is, the staff behind the counter were still very nice and friendly when I was ordering my food. I did not buy much food since I am alone. I chose to eat here on that particular day because I missed their food and there’s no better spot in the area when it comes to hot dogs than this spot, so it was really a great choice. I was just glad that the wait I experienced was worth it because I got to have a taste of their food again and it was so good. I just ordered two hotdogs, and they were both fresh and hot, and they tasted delicious. I also got myself their best chocolate cake shake, which is definitely the best chocolate cake shake I have ever had in my life. It was still a good idea to visit the spot at this location. The service is more on the downside considering that it is slow, but the food is so delicious that I will definitely not mind waiting a long time.",1
1888,This place was great. The feel for old world traditions hit you as soon as you walk in. Its a big place and they have a lot of different food options to choose from. The food was awesome and it represents some of the signature tastes of Chicago. I would certainly recommend this place.,1
1889,"Great place to grab a quick bite. Super fast and efficient service with first come seating.
The dog was great and goes well with the fat tire they had on tap. Definitely get the jumbo dog though.",1
1890,"We got a sampler of dogs (Chicago & chill-chesse) & beef (big beef & beef with sausage) all very tasty, but did not realize we needed to ask for the peppers & sauce for the beef.  Missed opportunity to enjoy a true Chicago Beef sandwich.",1
1891,Great authentic Chicago hotdog. Service was super fast and efficient.,1
1892,"This space is massive and so are the portions! If you come during lunch, expect a wait, but the line goes quick. If you're not super hungry, split a sandwich -- a whole one will fill you up for the day! (Then you won't have room Chicago for deep dish pizza later!)",1
1893,"Going to Chicago, everyone suggested I had to try Portillo. I had the cake shake, Chicago hot dog and beef sandwich (not all at the same time). I thought the beef sandwich was okay, i liked they give a lot of meat and the peppers were delicious, but I wouldnt get it again but I really enjoyed the hot dog, I would probably just get that next time. The cake shake is definitely memorable, I ordered a small but after a few sips I couldn’t drink it any more, it was just too heavy for me, but I did enjoy the chunks of cake in it. I really liked the inside, it was fast service and the prices are good.

Next time I would try the plain vanilla shake and a hot dog",1
1894,A great place for an inexpensive meal. It is loud inside and the ordering system is chaotic.  My wife's order was incorrect and the replacement also not what was expected. I had the Chicago dog which was excellent. Has a nice ambience and does have beer and wine available.,1
1895,My friend said thatbthis was the best beef spot in Chicago i believe that he lied. Maybe the second best beef sandwich spot in Chicago,1
1896,"On the list of must visit stops while in Chicago.   Just do it.  Get a dog,  get the Italian beef sandwich, find a table,  sit and enjoy.",1
1897,"Place is a unique Chicago experience by itself.
Loved the hotdog, chocolate cake shake and choco cake. Tried the italian beef and it was just okay.
Must try when in town",1
1898,"Such great food and the ambiance was awesome! Service was quick and easy and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit there. I got the chili cheese dog and fries. It's crazy how they use ingredients that you most likely already have at home, but there's something about the way they make it that makes it soooo much better than anything I could ever make. I also usually don't like those crinkle fries that for some reason always dry out your mouth, but the crinkle fries here was totally worth it. They were absolutely perfect! Highly suggest a visit when you're in town.",1
1899,Chicago hotdog is good as well as the chocolate cake. Husband liked the onion rings.,1
1900,"We went here as part of a walking food tour called Best in Chow which I highly recommend! The guide explained the history of both Portillo's and the Chicago dog, and said her only rule was try a bite with everything. I did and was astonished at the taste, there are two things on there I don't eat but together they taste great!",1
1901,Definitely will revisit on my next vacation. It was a different experience. I even bought some stock while standing inline,1
1902,"We came just to try the Chicago beef hotdog. I’m not a Chicago expert or anything, I’m just reviewing as a tourist.

We loved it. I was surprised at the price, I expected to pay more. So that was a nice surprise.

We would definitely return if in the area.",1
1903,This was a great stop on our Chicago trip! We read the reviews and were expecting a tourist trap kinda place. The place was busy but the line moved fast. It was a good cheap meal. The decor was very old school and the staff friendly. We shared the hotdog and beef sandwich with fries. All were pretty good. This is a quick fast food stop so rated that way. Don’t expect a Michelin star place :),1
1904,"This Portillos has a variety of alcohol drinks which is always a great combination. Their strawberry daiquiris are delicious.  The only thing I’d advise is to check your order if you’re not eating in, they tend to forget at least one thing from my experience. Lots of down town traffic so keep this in mind if you go around rush hour or peak times.",1
1905,"The beef sandwich changed my life. It was so, so good. Apparently we have locations in California, so I will be seeking those out in the near future.",1
1906,"Went on a Sunday during the day while vacationing in Chicago. This location was recommended by one of my friends as a must try Chicago hot dog style experience.

The location is quite busy with very extensive line ups and tables fully seated. There are two floors and area where you can pick up your food. You can tell the regulars from the tourists. All the co-workers looked like they did not want to be there and appeared angry (probably due to how busy it is). Once you order you have to wait for them to call out your number. However, they don't go in order and sometimes forget someone's number. Luckily they use a PA system.

The hot good I tried was good but that's all I can say. The toppings were more than the hotdog. Overall you can eat in just two bites. My recommendation is to get a combo of some sort or extra food.

I would come again and give it another shot.",1
1907,Amazing food and a neat atmosphere. If you've never had it before and are in Chicago this is a MUST try. The food is amazing.,1
1908,Never had a Chicago dog and was directed here - a great recommendation !  Such a great blend of flavors both tangy and savory.   Also had the Italian beef and a chili cheese dog.   Everything was just awes6 !!,1
1909,"Growing up on the West Coast, I never had a chance to try Portillos so I was eager to give it a shot when I was in Chicago. We came here close to midnight on Saturday and it was popping (probably because it was lollapalooza weekend). Waited in line for about 20 minutes but it was nice that they were pretty efficient about taking your order. You slide down to your left to pick up your food and they call you by number. They call out food based on when it’s ready, not in numerical order. Tried the Chicago hot dog - while it was a good hot dog, it certainly wasn’t life changing. I liked the sesame seed bun and how soft it was. I liked the chili dog more - it wasn’t soggy but still soft and I like the flavor of the chili. We also got a chocolate cake shake - I was surprised when I saw the size given that we got a small, but it was really big. I also didn’t realize that they would throw in an actual slice of chocolate cake. When we neared the end of the shake, there were chunks of soggy cake at the bottom that you can’t slurp up with a straw, so we just let them be. It was very sweet and so rich, but was it worth it after spending a day in the sweltering heat of Lollapalooza - yes indeed.",1
1910,"Cute place, but the food is an absolute joke. We were excited to go here and have never been more disappointed in any food place like this. The hot dogs are a disgrace.. For real and I am not a picky eater. Flat, all soggy and just like..nothing so plain so horrible. We felt so robbed of our money and a wasted opportunity to have a classic Chicago lunch while we're here. Wished we had found a food truck instead..",0
1911,I had a beef hotdog yesterday and the taste was ok nothing special. You dont get that feeler good of a sincere service. Just get you bag of food and beat it.,0
1912,I was visiting my daughter in Chicago and had to make sure to hit Portillo's. Had a great original dog. Highly recommend to anyone.,1
1913,"First time to this famous fast food, and liked the decor. Food is ok. Service is great.",1
1914,Not giving one star based on the food flavor. Rating is based on needed to wait nearly 1.5hrs for a hot dog and a beef.,0
1915,"Best Chicago style hot dog that I ate!
Price to quality ratio is great!
I found the venue and the atmosphere really nice also.
Staff were friendly and the place was clean.
Big recommendation.",1
1916,"While visiting Chicago for the weekend, we wanted to try a Chicago style hotdog 🌭 and Portillo's did not disappoint.  Be prepared to stand in a Neverending long line. We waited for about 30 minutes.",1
1917,"Their food is average, but they ALWAYS mess up your order!!! I know they are busy, but with all the people they employ, one should be checking the orders.....just saying",0
1918,Good place for fast food.  My Greek salad wasn't all that good.  The greens were a little soft and the salad seemed a little bland.  Those in my group seemed to be happy with their hot dogs.,1
1919,This was the best hot dog I've had in forever!!! This place was super busy and high energy and great if you're visiting or have family coming to town. Make sure and try the pomegranate limeade if it's in season!,1
1920,"Amazingly fun atmosphere, ""outside on the inside"". Broad selection of food, better than carnival food, amazing prices.  The Chicago Dog is not as good as Super Dawgs, but well worth the trip for the ambience alone. Check it out! You won't be disappointed!!",1
1921,Exciting interior. The hot dogs and milkshakes are great. I would recommend this place to anyone going to Chicago.,1
1922,"Portillo's has the best burgers of food chains of similar price, in addition to their famous hot dogs. This specific location maintains the traditional architecture and interior design with themes from the early 1900s, especially the old style gangsters. These two elements make for an enjoyable place to have a burger, a hot dog or even a pasta (as Barnelli's is located in the same food court).",1
1923,We went on a saturday and we had to wait like 30 minutes to get our food ! You must have patience to go there!,1
1924,"Going in here is always a good time, except when I went to this fast food restaurant on a particular day and the service was so slow and there was no food on my orders. That day was probably the worst or the worst experience I had had at this location of Portillo’s. I know this restaurant as a place where the service is great and quick, but I do not know what happened, but on that particular day, their service was definitely disappointing. As usual, the place was packed, but even in that case, from my previous experience, I was still able to get my food quickly. I ordered a Chicago dog, fries, and a shake. It was definitely wrong on my part because I did not check my order before leaving, and when I was about to eat it, I noticed that the fries were missing. I was really disappointed. The Chicago dog was good. I do not have a problem with it and I like it as well as the milkshake, but I was really disappointed with their service. The prices were reasonable too, and the food was good. It was only the service that was lacking on that particular day. I would still go back, hoping to have a better experience next time.",1
1925,"When we searched for hotdog places near us, this one was the closest one that looked decent. If you've never been here, the first time you walk in is totally not what you would expect. This place is pretty big! It looks like there are multiple little restaurants in side but I think there's just 2, the main food one and a dessert one. It was pretty packed when we went in but there was ample seating.. There's even a whole section upstairs to sit at.

The food was really tasty too. The wife got a regular dog with some cheese fries and I got the beef and sausage combo with onion rings. We both left pleased and with full bellies.",1
1926,"With the exception of O’Hare airport, this Canadian had never been to Chicago. Finally had a proper 4-day visit. “Get a Chicago dog,” they said. “They can’t be found anywhere else,” they said. Well, maybe that’s a good thing. Honestly, so disappointed. The young woman calling out the numbers was angry at the world. The hot dog itself was a soggy mess; could only stomach 2 bites. The fries were not hot and fresh. The milkshake was good. Sorry.",0
1927,"Absolutely loved the food which is the only thing saving this review. I have never seen such unorganized management in my life.  I was extremely excited to experience portillos with my mother in law because it's one of my favorite places however, this experience was horrible!

We ordered 2 regular beef sandwiches, a big beef sandwich, a hotdog and a shake at 6:45pm and watched 3 entire lines worth of people order and get their food before us. We ended up getting our food at 7:32 almost a solid hour after ordering. When we got to our table we didn't even have the big beef sandwich and the shake was chocolate when it was meant to be lemon strawberry.

The food was absolutely amazing but the long wait on top of watching literally 50 orders go before us was not very appealing.",1
1928,good self serving style casual restaurant. very local vibe and delicious foods,1
1929,"Delicious hot dogs, subs and salad! Will definitely come back for the hotdogs!!!",1
1930,"Honestly, Portillo's is somewhere you don't just go because of the food. It's more of an overall experience. Such a cool restaurant that might be touristy, but also is just really unique. The hot dog is pretty good, maybe not the best, but with a nice snap and good crunchy pickle. Definitely doesn't need ketchup!",1
1931,First time really exploring downtown Chicago as an adult and Potillo's was must. The wait was a little long but well worth it. The food was so delish and you get your money's worth.,1
1932,Checked out this spot during my visit to Chicago and loved it. Easily the best hot dog I've ever had and for a reasonable price. I would have happily ordered another! Absolutely recommend.,1
1933,"Delicious and fresh pasta. Very flavourful. My partner ordered their traditional hotdog and it was amazing. On top of good food, their customer service is phenomenal.",1
1934,Best dogs ever. And killer chocolate malt . Also had the polish sausage with spicy portillo sauce.,1
1935,"This place was everything I wanted my first Chicago-style hot dog experience to be. Not only was the food great, the staff and service was excellent as well.",1
1936,"I don’t know what I can say about these Chicago hot dogs that hasn’t already been said 1000x. I’ve avoided Portillo’s elsewhere in the US because I wanted to try it in Chicago first.

When I first unwrapped the dog, I wondered, how will I even be able to taste this puny hot dog? But I was wrong to question Portillo’s! The dog held its own, bursting with flavor. All of the toppings and the bun were top-notch. Will definitely enjoy one again someday.",1
1937,This was super packed when I got here and the food did not disappoint.  I love this place and will definitely recommend and come back. The Chicago dog was amazing.,1
1938,A huge restaurant of bustling energy and delicious food. Come visit a historic spot for Chicago and have the famous hot dogs. We loved it and the chocolate cake shakes are definitely delicious.,1
1939,"Famous Chicago style hotdog place. I love their hotdog. Hotdog is a bit small for lunch, so I usually order two. Always busy, but nobody stays long so you’ll find your seat easily.",1
1940,Hot Dog it was delicious. Lasted all afternoon. Best meal we had in Chicago. Onion rings were good (we came around 1pm) they were warm .,1
1941,"Gives the Chicago experience, I got a cake shake and their famous signature chocolate cake and it was fine. The wait was over 40 minutes for food because there was an issue with the line and the only way that I got my stuff was when I spoke up and just told them what I got instead of waiting for my number to be called like they said originally",1
1942,"Although they forgot to add the cheese, mustard, and peppers the hot dogs were yummy. Always something that we enjoy to eat while we're in Chicago!",1
1943,Classic Portillo’s - served Tourist style! Staff isn’t too friendly but they mean business… always busy. Even at open on a weekday. They serve booze,1
1944,Visiting home this past weekend made me truly miss Portillo's as well as home! There's places in TN that claim to have Chicago's Italian Beef and Hot Dogs but they're nowhere close to this! Thank you for the amazing customer service as well despite being so crowded!!,1
1945,"Excellent!! Wonderful location, great ambience and amazing food!  A must stop if in the Chicago area",1
1946,"First time here and really enjoyed the food. Service was already really fast, which was greatly appreciated since I was extremely hungry. Despite having a long line, it moved very quickly and the food came out within minutes. Would definitely eat here again.",1
1947,Hot Dog was juicy and the taste was good! However they forgot to give me my meatballs,1
1948,"Chicago dog was delicious, but was a little turned off by the pushing and showing to pick my order.",1
1949,"Really good, however when its busy it is REALLY busy. When getting cups of water try to ask for no ice, or else you will be getting 90% ice and 10% water.",1
1950,"The food was great and I am a believer in the Chicago dog, threw the garden. But while the food was delicious and the decor fun and open. This is another example of the attitudes of uncaring teens ruining a business. Go for the food but not the service",1
1951,"The decor is great, its a fun place. I waited 30 minutes for my food: beef sandwich and burger. Shakes are delicious! It's a worthy stop.",1
1952,Went here as part of a Chicago eating tour. Had Italian dipped beef sandwich. Probably the messiest and most delicious sandwich I've ever experienced. Loved the whole culinary adventure !,1
1953,"Everything on the menu is delicious. My favorite sandwiches are the grilled portobello and the spicy chicken one.

Do be careful with your stuff though,  it is super easy for pickpockets to take stuff out of purses and unattended jackets. Happened to a friend",1
1954,"I tried to like this, but it’s just not my thing. I’ve gone here twice. The service is fine. I just didn’t really like their Chicago-style dogs or burgers.",0
1955,"Reliable Chicago eatery offering traditional hot dogs, burgers and salads in a cool Chicago themed restaurant",1
1956,"Great chili dog, the bread was warm with poppy seed. The atmosphere was really warming a very 80’s diner feel with the checkered cloth. Lots of pictures and replicas. Great experience and most definitely worth the visit. I high recommend the chili dog and Portillo dog.",1
1957,Go for the double. IT beef dripping wet and loaded with hot peppers. Then follow it up with a traditional CH style dog. Always double check they have everything in your order. Chocolate cake is a good treat when thy make a rare mistake.,1
1958,I ate at Portillos (twice) at the recommendation of friends and family in Chicago.  The Italian beef sandwich is excellent and you have to get it dipped and with fries. The Chicago style hot dogs are excellent as well. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago!,1
1959,"We loved the hot dogs! Went back a bunch of times in a week😁! The only thing we did not like, was where and how we had to wait for our order. We had to stand in front of a counter and listen to someone call out your number (which was not always very clear what she was saying). But the hot dogs very awesome👍🏻!",1
1960,"Good food. The River North location can be very confusing. Depending upon what you order, you may have to pick up food from different areas of the restaurant. Service is okay at best. Some staff (including a manager) goofing off while other staff working franticly to keep up.",1
1961,"I really like the theme of the restaurant and the flavor of the hot dogs, however, ribs in my opinion is the best food they have",1
1962,"I enjoyed the hot dog they were simple yet delicious, the beef sandwich was amazing, the meat was tender, moist. Chocolate cake was from another level I recommend this place without a doubt.",1
1963,"Thoroughly blown after my most recent visit to Portillos. I haven’t been in years as I usually eat healthier. I decided to have a cheat day and boy do I regret it. I asked for the Italian combo, lightly dipped with a side of hot peppers. Did I get my hot peppers on the side? Eh, no. Was my sandwich lightly dipped? Eh, no. Not even sure when I will be back.",0
1964,Came here for the hotdog experience but I was not pleased at all. However the ribs are fabulous!!! Glad I chose two options!,1
1965,"If you're ever in Chicago, you must try these hotdogs. They are fire! They were so good I had to get seconds. I will definitely eat here again.",1
1966,"Came here after reading great reviews and wasnt disappointed. The place looks like a small food court with multiple registers and lines. You have to order food at one of the registers and then they call you when your order is ready (no table service). It took 15 minutes for our order to be ready which wasn't so bad. Although the hot dogs were good, I enjoyed the Italian sandwich more",1
1967,"Although I rarely eat hot dogs, Portillo's is my must-have when visiting Chicago. The food, the atmosphere and the service were great.",1
1968,"I've grown up eating Portillos, but since moving near this location, I've given it chance after chance. However, there's basically a 50% chance that you end up waiting nearly an hour for your food or they give you the wrong food at this location. Or, in my most recent case, both of those things. Portillo's food has always been tasty, but it's just not worth the struggle to actually get it.",0
1969,"LOVE THE ITALIAN BEEF (HEAVY GRAVY OF COURSE) and Chocolate Cake Shakes, Dogs are great too",1
1970,Cavernous place nd confusing lines.  Polish sausage and onions ring were  great but cake shake hard to drink and chicago dog was just ok.,1
1971,Lived up to the hype.  It's a Chicago staple.  The dogs and beef sandwiches are amazing,1
1972,"We came here as tourists. I got a hotdog , my other friends got hamburgers. Nothing special. The hotdog was hard the chew, almost like it had a plastic wrap around it. My friends mentioned his burger tasted burnt. We did however like the chocolate cake shake. I wouldn’t recommend it. It felt like gas station food.",0
1973,I have a soft place in my heart for Portillo's because their food is consistently excellent. Their service is just a hair off center though.  But I still think it's worth the trip.,1
1974,"Well organized restaurant. If you are looking for a delicious Chicago Style Hot Dog, go to Portillo's :)",1
1975,They're delicious and their food is always amazing. My only complaint is that they are expensive but honestly for the quality it's worth it,1
1976,"Burger is ok,. But come for the Italian beef and the cake shakes! Fries are just out of the freezer crinkle cut, but the entrees are fantastic. And seriously, get a cake shake!",1
1977,"Our experience was great! From the moment we walked in, Mama T took us under her wing and guided us through what to order, how to maximize our visit and took care of us every step of the way. She is so amazing!!! I would come back just to see Mama T, but would also have the Chicago dog and beef sandwich again. The food was great. Thank you Mama T for showing us a GREAT time :)",1
1978,Good food. Service was absolute chaos! We were missing a beef sandwich and our drinks. Three people were already up at the counter complaining about a wrong order or missing items. The girls behind the counter were just handing out food to people. Can’t imagine how this company is still in business!,1
1979,"The food is good, but talking about the hot dogs, most of the times you need to get the bigger ones: the regular ones are just too little.
The cashiers here are not so ""full of patience"" and they don't want to explain any detail about what comes in the dishes you may order.
Getting your soda is another thing: they won't give you,... you must look for it.
The place is very cool, has a very good atmosphere and the price is cheap.
Worths!",1
1980,"It is a great place, but they often  get the order wrong and some workers behave unprofessional and show their attitude. Overall it is a great dinner which is ready to satisfy your fast food cravings till late at night. Family friendly and fun.",1
1981,"Super nice.
If you are visiting Chicago, check out this classic hotdog place.
Hotdogs are great, and sold at good prices.

I deducted one star because of the sizes of the hotdog. Their regular size is more like a mini-hotdog. And their so called jumbo size is a regular hotdog. If you are hungry make sure you get the jumbo and a side (their fries are good).",1
1982,"Good place where you can go to eat, delicious yummy hamburger the same price like MacDonald's.",1
1983,"It's good, but loses a star for the poor service. They forgot my drink twice and one hot dog came with garnish missing. I think they move too fast for their own good.",1
1984,A little bit pricey but definitely the best hot dog I've ever had. Glad I decided to splurge,1
1985,"My husband and I came here for the first time over the 4th of July weekend. We didn't have hot dogs, but we both had a Italian beef sandwiches which were absolutely amazing! There are no reservations, and even when the line extended all the way to the door, their service was surprisingly quick.",1
1986,"Horrible customer service  My husband ordered Italian beefs and hotdogs. The hot dogs showed up, but not the Italian beef. So my husband called them back and the person put him on hold for a long time. So he called back and asked for his money back for what he didn't receive. They told him that it was on its way. That was over 30 minutes ago. It is less than a mile away. It's not coming and they stopped answering his calls.",0
1987,"Liked the polish hot dog better than the Chicago style hot dog as the chicago one was quite messy (that's the style).

The beef sandwich had no condiments or other ingredients - it was pure beef.",1
1988,"Look over the menu in line so you're ready to order. This is a fast moving place. I'm a tourist, so I tried The Best which is the infamous Chicago hot dog. Bun was soggy and it was lukewarm. It was good, but underwhelming. Knickknacks inside are really cool.",1
1989,"The Portillos dog was amazing, but I personally liked the pasta bowls!",1
1990,"Great food! I loved the hot dog and the beef sandwich. However the people working at the counter were extremely rude. But if it means anything, even with horrible service the food was good enough to give this place 4 stars.",1
1991,"Portillo's has a wide menu selection. Salads, pasta, sandwiches, hamburgers, hotdogs, polish dogs, bbq ribs, Italian beef,shakes and desserts. Chocolate cake is the best in Chicago.",1
1992,Love the fresh food and Chocolate cakeeeeeee YUMMy!!  The best hotdogs and atmosphere was amazing!! Clean and efficient team and so friendly. Cannot wait to stop again!!,1
1993,"Great dogs, great burgers, and a great atmosphere! We enjoyed the nostalgia of looking around the restaurant at all the pictures sighen by celebrities, politicians, and big names from many generations who have enjoyed a bite from this culinary legend. My jumbo Chicago dog was perfect and a great captor my week in the city.",1
1994,Really good food I  have to go back  because it also looks Soo cool in there.,1
1995,"We were here around 3pm and there were not much people. We did not have to queue long. Got very lucky.
We were very worried because of other one star reviews.
The Portillo dogs were really good. I had two lol",1
1996,"This place reminded me of a food court when I first walked in. There are at least 25 workers, and they make sure your food is out quickly. I got the big beef sandwich dipped in gravy, and it was huge. It was definitely worth $10. The meat is succulent, and the gravy adds another layer. The fries are pretty good. The chocolate cake milkshake is delicious, and I can't wait to go back just for that.",1
1997,"Chicago staple and for good reason. Delicious dogs, great chocolate cake, affordable prices, and speedy service. And the restaurant itself is an experience on its own.",1
1998,Salad on a hot dog?  It is OK but I am from New York where one puts mustard and perhaps saur kraut on a much tastier grilled dog.   But when in Rome.......,1
1999,I took a chance on this place while visiting and wish I hadn't. The chili dog was a mess and it looked like whoever prepared it gave it a good squeeze after it was wrapped. On top of that the person working the pickup area had a really bad attitude and should have been sent home but I guess the manager wasn't paying attention although it was evident to me and others. The person next to me was so frustrated that they kept shaking their head and said there was also a location in California and it was just as bad. He was waiting for a dessert and was finally told he had to pick it up from another area of the restaurant. Anyway back to my situation... I went to the pickup area for a chili dog after picking up a salad from another area of the restaurant. Since my number had passed I went to the pickup area and showed my ticket to the lady with the bad attitude to see if my order was sitting somewhere. She looked at my ticket and walked away without saying anything and I heard her off to the side yelling at someone for gravy. After a while she came back again and I again showed my ticket and she said nothing to me instead walking away. A short while later another staff member came and asked me if I needed something and I told him that I was waiting for my order and this other lady with the bad attitude came back and reacted as though she was offended that I was asking for assistance from somebody else as apparently she was working on it but had never acknowledged me when I asked about my order. She mentioned something about getting my onion rings which I had no idea about since she had not spoken one word to me up until that point. I did see her finally grab onion rings and walk over to a bag that had my chili dog in it. I saw her open the bag and drop the onion rings into the bag from about 3 inches above the bag which again showed me how bad of an attitude she had. I will never return to this place and wouldn't recommend it and shame on the manager for not paying attention to what was going on in the restaurant. The only reason I gave it a 2-star is because another person in my party said the salad was okay.,0
2000,I don’t know why this place is getting good reviews. It was probably the worst “hot dog” that I have ever had. The environment was cool but the food was not good at all. It looks like a Chicago dog but tastes like rubber.,0
2001,"WOW! SO GOOD!! We just moved to Chicago recently and this place was recommended from a friend, so we had to try it.

This is definitely one of my new favorites!! It's one of those places where everything on the menu is amazing. The classic is the Portillo's chicago-style hot dog, which was delicious. And you have to get the chopped salad! It has tiny pasta noodles and is chopped finely- probably my favorite salad ever.

Definitely try the chocolate cake for dessert- super moist! The onion rings are delicious too..and it's hard to get a perfect onion ring!

Only downside is there's usually a long line- you'll probably wait about 30 min, but it's worth it.",1
2002,"Went during my conference last week...oh my! I had the Chicago Dog and Beef sandwich...yums! When we come back, I'm definitely heading over to Portillo's!!!!",1
2003,"Portillos is a great place to grab a burger, hot dog, Italian beef sandwich, or milkshakes.

There is a drive thru line, which can be pretty convenient throughout the day, except during peak hours, where the drive thru line can get super backed up (we’ve waited up to 45 mins in the drive through, in which case it would actually be faster to just go in and order at the front).

I recommend the cheese burger, chili cheese hotdog, Italian beef sandwich, and the vanilla milk shake. All solid and consistently made!",1

We appreciate your input and hope you will visit Portillo's again very soon.",1
2005,"It’s a place to grab a Chicago-style hot dog. I’ve been told the chocolate cake shake is to
die for, they also have crinkle fries! Chicago-style hot dogs don’t have ketchup on them, so if you’re trying one for the first time, know it’s a bit different, but good! Their chilli cheese dog is delicious too! I usually grab the Chicago and a chilli and some fries.",1
2006,Let me tell you I could not wait to get to Chicago to get me a Chicago style hotdog. I was so disappointed not what I expected it to be. It was decent but not fantastically delicious. My husband got the polish sausage with grill onions and as you can see he love it.,1
2007,Busy and incredibly worth it. Grab the chocolate cake milkshake and regret it never…. Lol,1
2008,"The WORST portillos in the Chicago area. The employees are ignorant and lazy . They have attitudes about doing the job they are being paid for and don’t even do it correctly!! and managers are just as bad, if not worse . I am a doordash driver , and I am not one to complain about food services, but I have been in this store multiple times to pick up customers orders and every SINGLE time I come in there is NOBODY at the pickup line despite multiple workers walking around on their phone and flirting with eachother.  Food often comes incorrect and the shakes sit out in the open until somebody decides to pick them up , often resulting in melted drinks. This restaurant is a complete trash of the portillos name and needs better customer service ASAP!!! I would rate negative stars if possible .",0
2009,The food was great. If the guy at the front that works there tells you it’s an hour wait just stay. It ends up being 25-30 min tops. We saw so many people leave because he said it’s an hour wait…,1
2010,Pleasantly surprised by a great atmosphere and great food for an affordable price.,1
2011,"Visiting Chicago has been awesome, Portillos was an experience and the hotdog was delicious as well as the ribs, onion rings and the cheese sauce my daughter had with her fries was very cheesy. Loved the experience. May go back before I leave.",1
2012,My large fry and cup of cheese both half filled ! Ridiculous,0
2013,The beef sandwich was the best I've ever had! The hot dog is divine!!!! The chocolate cake couldn't be any better.,1
2014,Awesome food and friendly service in a great atmosphere. Chicago Blackhawks fans this is an important stop to see the original 1938 Stanley Cup Banner.,1
2015,"Workers were incredibly pleasant and patient, especially considering how late and how much I was ordering (20 minutes before closing for 5 people 😱)! The outstanding customer service completely elevated my experience there and I look forward to returning :)",1
2016,"Very rude people, long wait time. It took us 30min plus to get our food. Very long queues for ordering. When asked for our expected time for food the bouncer was very rude. Need better management. Rated 2 stars only for good food.",0
2017,"Definitely a must-visit when in Chicago. I figured I'd try the chicken parmesan, since the last time I had the beef sandwich and chocolate cake. My recommendation? Stick with the beef sandwich. Prices are reasonable, service is fast and portions are generous.",1
2018,"Waited almost 40m for just 1 hotdog... I wish I could say it was worth the wait, but all it really tasted like was a hotdog and pickle... a staple that you're better off recreating at home.",0
2019,"Walking in was like walking into a Disney world attraction. Of course the bonus that Portillo's has over Disney is that they serve awesome food. We had the Hot Dogs, Fries and Onion rings and everything was outstanding. I was told to go elsewhere since this place is touristy (I mean it is across the street from a Rainforest Cafe and Hard Rock) but I am happy I went anyway. I can't wait to go back to try the Italian Beef next.",1
2020,Sat down for a bite with my sister and we both felt that we got plenty of food and there was hardly any wait time and everything was delicious - I would’ve taken pictures but we might’ve wolfed it down too quickly for that - highly recommend this place.,1
2021,Best place for Chicago dogs! 🌭,1
2022,"Nice clean place for lunch. Food was great! Long line when we walked in, but it moved very quickly. Didn't have to wait long for food.",1
2023,Love vibes and delicious hotdogs,1
2024,I was soooo disappointed in the classic Chicago dog. Maybe my expectations were really high. Overall not that impressed. Live moved pretty quick. The upstairs seating was closed so it was difficult to find a seat especially during the lunch hour. Good to experience the classic portillo’s Chicago dog but wouldn’t go back.,1
2025,This piece has made it's way onto the must visit list when I'm in Chicago.  The Chicago style hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches dipped in the gravy are always amazing.,1
2026,"One of my favorite hot dogs in America.  It's heaps better than Lafayette in Detroit, Rudys in Ohio, and on par with the hot dog places in LA country.",1
2027,"We always order from here and always great, food is good. Lately couple of orders for delivery had missing orders. So frustrating, even though I get refund...we waiting for our food so we can eat and members of my family can't cause their food  is missing.",1
2028,Try a combo dipped. And a jumbo dog with cucumbers. The best!,1
2029,"Just to put into context how amazing this place is: I'm a vegetarian and I ate three hot dogs from this place. I had one regular hot dog, one chili cheese dog and one jumbo hot dog. I dragged my boyfriend back here twice more after our first visit because I was dreaming of these hot dogs. They taste very fresh and not processed like pork hot dogs. The sesame bun is a game changer and the peppers and pickle just top it off. Absolutely amazing. And the fries are good, too. It is a must-try in Chicago!

My boyfriend and I also split a chocolate malt/milkshake, which had actual brownies at the bottom. Again, delicious. When my boyfriend was tired of eating hot dogs, he got chicken parm and some kind of panini. He really liked them and said they were also delicious.",1
2030,"This is one of the Chicago touristy food spots for Chicago hotdogs. Place is usually crowded. Once you go in there are two lines one for dogs, burgers, Italian beef and other for salad, ribs, and pasta. Overall good for a one time visit!",1
2031,"It was really good. I got the pesto pasta with chicken and no mushrooms and it was good (see the picture below)  but didn't expect it to be so creamy, yet was delicious. My boyfriend got the sausage and beef and ate it before I even got through half of mine. I like the mugs the beer is served in.",1
2032,Usually don’t complain but I’m tired of coming here and missing something every time. I get it happens every now and then but this is very common at this location,0
2033,"Loved the food! It's confusing,  first time here. But it was amazing. The environment was beautiful!! The food was. Great!!!!!! I got the steak hot dog,  chocolate cake shake, spaghetti, and cake.  Everything perfect and on point! But have an ear to listen to your order!",1
2034,Must go for a chicago dog fast food style. Very industrialized feel and takes about 15 minutes to get your order on a busy day.,1
2035,"First time trying a Chicago dog and it was delicious. Friends ordered a portabello burger, salad, and other sandwiches. Everything came as ordered and quickly which was a surprise because it was so busy.",1
2036,"Best place to experience one of these famous Chicago dogs! Plenty of seating, quick ordering process and very reasonably priced. If you want the most authentic, go here!",1
2037,"Chaos, really hard to understand where to order and where to pick up, they really need a better flow

However, the quality of hotdog is awesome! The cheese fries were great. A must when in Chicago!

Will be back to try other food they offer",1
2038,"Trying Chicago fare and this was a highly recommended stop. I am not a fan of the hotdog per se  , but have to admit the beef hotdog with condiments - not ketchup!! Was delicious.",1
2039,Great food and service as always. Can't go wrong with an Italian Beef sandwich dipped with giardiniera peppers and a slice of chocolate cake!,1
2040,"Yummy food! Everything we tried was tasty, particularly the big beef (Italian beef)! Prices are fair, good sized portions. We didn't get part of our order at first but had no issue getting the missing food. The decorations are amazing and the feel of the place was great!",1
2041,"Fantastic!  Excellent food, pretty good service.  The floor staff was MUCH more helpful than the order staff was.
The. Best. Italian. Sausage. Ever.",1
2042,"Next time we'll order online but the food was great! Hotdogs, fries, cheese sauce, and some extra peppers hit the spot.",1
2043,Chicago style hot dogs with tomatoes onions and pickles..great hot fries.  Order and pick up and find a table style.$$  vintage decor interesting.,1
2044,"The branch I visited had a very retro design (really awesome) but the floor plan was a little confusing if it's your first time in it due to the way the counters were positioned (and utilized) probably due to the pandemic.

Ordered the regular sized classic Chicago style hotdog that came with a big slice of a pickle and 2 peppers. It's smaller than regular hotdog sandwiches you get from other stores but it was filling. The taste is unique to Chicago, mostly beefy and tangy with no hint of sweetness (no ketchup). I personally liked it but I think it gets over-hyped by the internet. It's not mind-blowing but still worth the visit as its the closest Chicago style hotdog in the downtown area.",1
2045,Great ambiance - crowded but to be expected from such a great spot! Italian beef sandwich was great! Don’t skip on the hot dogs or shakes!,1
2046,Love the burger and fries,1
2047,"Simply the best dog I have ever had in Chicago. Also had an Italian beef. All of the food was amazing, as was the service. Would definitely recommend to anyone.",1
2048,"What's not to love?  Italian beef sandwiches, Chicago sausages, even salads, fish, chicken, veggie dogs.  Beer, soda, ice cream and cake for dessert.  Portillo's has it all!",1
2049,Really! Best hot dog in Chicago? No way! It’s basically a fast food cheap boiled hot dog! Go somewhere else! Totally disappointed ☹️,0
2050,"We had the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers and the standard ""extra gravy."" It was delicious! Lots of meat on the sandwich. I am not sure how one could eat a bigger version of this sandwich. However we did find room to try their famous chocolate cake. It was also very good. Definitely a must-try place if you visit Chicago.",1
2051,i had a polish sausage hot dog and it was very salty and w/o any real flavour. resto has nice feels to it,1
2052,"First time trying Italian beef. I had it the default style which is extra gravy (au jus). And with sweet peppers. It was really good, and I would definitely eat it again. I would like more peppers on it, though. I also had a slice of chocolate cake. That was excellent, and I'd recommend it if you love chocolate cake.",1
2053,"Not the Best Portillos! Went to this location strictly because of convenience. Fries were like warm at Best!! Food was just Mediocre!
Customer Service was GREAT from young Lady taking orders!",1
2054,"Hot dog so so, Italian beef very tasty. Customer service needs some work.",0
2055,Love them thank you again Letairra for a good recommendation,1
2056,"The Biggest Hot Dog House we've ever seen , serves some of the best comfort food including amazing Italian Sausage and of course Hot Dogs .",1
2057,"Great Italian beef! It was a massive rush when we went since it was Lolla weekend, but it was still as smooth of service as it could have been.",1
2058,Do not come here unless you want to wait an hour for your food!!! No hot dog is worth this calamity- absolutely insane that people order and then stand an hour for your items.  #worstofchicago #totallyoverated,0
2059,Just do yourself and your stomach a favor and go here!! You won't be disappointed and you'll be experiencing a big part of the Chicago food experience.,1
2060,"Overall, good Chicago style dog. Only three stars because they were very light on the mustard (and didn't offer additional mustard packets) and I prefer more finely chopped onion.",1
2061,Classic establishment with a noteworthy polish sausage and cake shake. Just don't go when they're really busy or they'll mess up your order and it'll be cold by the time you get it.,1
2062,Can't go wrong with anything on the menu,1
2063,"Hot dogs were delicious
Fries not so much
Also chocolate cake was not what the hype is all about. I was disappointed.

I've had better",1
2064,Good eat and very affordable. Cake shake and hot dogs are delicious,1
2065,Always enjoy Portillo's it was super crowded and busy even for a Saturday night. There were at least 50 ppl  waiting for sandwiches and hot dogs. I Estill will be back.,1
2066,"Nice place to experience Chicago hotdog.

I ordered the original hotdog with everything.
There was no source but good enough.

The only matter was the table. It was difficult to find the emptied table.",1
2067,Amazing Maxwell Polish hotdog...Got some sport peppers on it as well..loved it.,1
2068,"Overprice, lesser portion beef sandwiches sold in a crowded and filthy restaurant with zero parking. I can't understand the appeal of coming here and I grew up in Chicago. Never again.",0
2069,Ordering online is the same as ordering in line. It was chaotic and really busy. They were also disorganized and forgot my sauce. Overall food was good.,1
2070,"Chaotic environment!! Long ridiculous wait times for Take out, Dine in and   Drive-through. Several orders were wrong. Other than that the food was good.",1
2071,"Yep, this place is legendary for good reason. The hot dog and cheese fries are absolutely obsessive-worthy. The line goes quick so don’t let crowdedness deter you - it’s worth the wait! It’s a huge restaurant with Chicago memorabilia everywhere. If you’re in Chicago you have to stop in and try Portillo’s!",1
2072,Portillo's Hot Dogs was incredible I absolutely recommend it. This was my first ever time eating a Chicago dog and let me tell yah it was great. Probably going back for lunch tommorow 😂.,1
2073,Had a blast visiting portillos and having a Chicago dog for the first time. Must visit of you're a tourist. Get the cake shake,1
2074,Really good and local burgers! And the place is magical! But you should try the hot dog their specialty.,1
2075,"Was not expecting to thoroughly enjoy myself as I did.  The sausage and beef dog I ordered was amazing and delicious, and the strawberry lemon cake shake was beyond anything I've tasted.",1
2076,Very nice restaurant to go to in downtown. I was able to get served within a timely manner and the food was very nice to eat!,1
2077,"I think fast food in Chicago is really greasy in general. Had the famous polish it's delicious but you can taste it was injected with fat. Hmm I think once is enough, now I have to go to the gym to burn off all this fat I ate.",1
2078,"Damn you and your Italian Beef Sandwiches...and your peppers. All your beef, cheese, gravy, bread... I can't eat another one. No más. Please.

Okay one more... Extra wet. Thanks!",1
2079,"You must (!) eat the Italian beef sandwich. It may looks small on the picture, but it isn't. The price is affordable and the meat is great, as well the place.",1
2080,1st of all I never made an order there but somebody went in and used my stolen credit card it was denied the transaction I've been calling since it happened which was yesterday and they have horrible service they don't answer the phone they don't try to come on the line they leave it ring ring and then they hang up on you horrible horrible customer service and horrible people working there working there I would be greatly appreciated if somebody can contact me would they can contact me with corporate's number,0
2081,"Food was great but service is lacking, the person taking our order never said anything and was expecting us to know it all. An smile and willingness to guide a new gest goes a long way",1
2082,"I'm probably one of the few people in this area who was there in the very early days, pretty much when it first opened. Back then the lines and crowds were way less, but they've really been able to handle the growth well. The side salad is a great deal, and the hot dog is good (though Superdawg is better). Chocolate and lemon cakes are delicious. Good service and consistently clean.",1
2083,"Fast, easy, delicious. What more do you need?? The Portillo dog was my favorite. You gotta try this chain when you for to Chicago.",1
2084,"Outstanding!!  The Italian Beef was absolutely delicious.  This is one of those rare very popular places where the food is out of this world good AND incredibly affordable.  They could easily charge double for their food but they keep it low cost, which is awesome when you're traveling on a budget.",1
2085,A must visit if you are visiting Chicago. Having an authentic Chicago hot dog along with a lot of preserved history from the city that was obtained by the owner.,1
2086,Tried a hot dog 🌭 it was so fresh and delicious! their interior was outstanding and super well decorated. 🇺🇸 🙌🏻 highly recommend,1
2087,"I got the Chicago Hotdog and an Italian beef, food was decent, but the service was terrible 👎🏻 Terrible attitude from our server, I actually laughed out loud",0
2088,They have a lot of food options which was all very good I have nothing bad to say about the food and the atmosphere of the interior was amazing very unique and the staff were very friendly and helpful,1
2089,Always a good experience. Had their milkshake last week. Pretty good,1
2090,"Hot dogs galore! Cakeshake is no mistake, an absolute joy!",1
2091,Italian beef sandwich wasn't very good (very plain and no flavor). Hotdog was great! Would go again!,1
2092,Food was good but there was several of us and it took a long time to get all the orders. Needed to ask about order status.,1
2093,Historic spot a must try If you go to the windy city,1
2094,"Portillo’s is the epitome of what makes America great. Wildly unhealthy, yes delicious food with epic portion sizes. This is a Chicago mainstay and a must try to anyone visiting the city. 5 stars no doubt.",1
2095,"You are transported to another world when you walk through the homely large wooden doors. I ordered take out. Nothing fancy, but fast service and delicious hot dogs.",1
2096,"A very touristy place. If you are here for the Chicago dog, please skip. There are other store got much better dogs. I was very disappointed.",0
2097,All the employees were friendly and knowledgeable. Got the portillo's hot dog and was not disappointed. It was tasty and filling after a morning of sight seeing!,1
2098,"Recommended by a local as the best Chicago hot dog. The place in W Ontario St is neatly decorated, wait wasn’t long, food service was fast & everything was warm. Variety of other food if not interested in hot dogs.",1
2099,"Amazing Chicago dog, the chocolate cake shake is a must try, whole slice of cake blended in. delicious!",1
2100,Chicago's hotdogs'. The most beautiful hotdogs I had in my entire Life. A MUST! The chocolate cake as dessert is never a regret.,1
2101,"Good Beef, quick online ordering, friendly staff. There was a little confusion on where  to pick up my Protillo's online order, I ended up having to pick up by a sign that said ""Barnelli's Waiting Only"" which seems to defy logic.",1
2102,We went here March 24. We got the regular dogs with everything on them! I have never eaten a hotdog with a pickle on it in my life but this was by far the best hotdog we have had ever!,1
2103,Ate here while on a work trip a few weeks ago and loved the food!  I got the beef/sausage combo with cheddar cheese and some fries and haven't ate that good in a while. The onion rings were really good as well.  Can't wait to eat here again next time I'm in town.,1
2104,"The Italian beef sandwich is amazing. I'm from the Philadelphia area so I thought I knew beef sandwiches. This is entirely different in flavor, and should not be missed. Tip: at the restaurant we visited there are actually 3 lines, although it appears there are 2. All 3 lines are right next to each other but there is a sign that makes it seem like just 2. Directly in front of the area where they show salads on the boards is the third line. You can use that to order sandwiches as well. That is a huge win on a busy day.",1
2105,"Food is great! Everything tastes good. milkshakes, hot dogs, chicken, and fries. Be a tourist and get on line.",1
2106,"This was a pit stop from an Airbnb experience (food tour) and it was here that I had this very moist and delicious chocolate cake. I would visit again on my next trip to Chicago, it was that good.",1
2107,Portillos is a long standing Chicago favourite. Hot dogs Chicago style (toppings galore). Beef and salad alternatives also available. The queues /lines look intimidating and the tables all full but it really isn't a bad wait and it's worth it. Just send one of your party to scout out a table (hover and act fast!) While the other orders. Within 10 minutes you'll have your food and a table to eat it at.,1
2108,Lives up to its reputation. Cool atmosphere and delicious hot dogs. Try to go out of peak times so you can enjoy the time there more. But they are quite efficient.,1
2109,"Loved this place. Great Portillo Dog. Cool decor, great atmosphere. Another Chicago hot spit! Turtle Custard was yummy!!",1
2110,"I'm glad I read an article in which it suggest we go to Portillos for a Chicago style hot dog. I'm also glad that I decided to get it exactly the way Chicagoan's eat it.  Me being from NY, I was so tempted to take everything off of it and eat it the way we do in NY. But then I thought, what's the point in getting a Chicago dog if I'm not going to eat it the way it's supposed to be eaten?

So my daughter and I got a traditional hot dog and we shared cheese fries and onion rings and we each got a small chocolate cake shake. The shakes were a mistake because they were not small at all.  We could have gotten one and asked for a courtesy cup to share it.  We wound up throwing most of the  shake away because one- it was way too sweet and 2- the small really isn't small at all.  So check the sizes first before ordering.

We got a small cheese fries and small onion rings and both were nice and hot and crispy. The cheese sauce is like cheese whiz but at least they give you enough in a separate cup to dip.  Hot dogs have a crisp snap when you bite into them and the relish is super green and not what I was expecting,  but it all tasted really good.

Portillo's inside decor has an old school feel and they have many different Chicago memorabilia throughout the restaurant.  It's not a fancy place, but it's clean with downstairs and upstairs seating. There were a bunch of pictures throughout of celebrities who've visited in the past. Service was pretty quick and the staff were patient and nice.

I'd recommend any tourist to visit for lunch.",1
2111,Went through the drive thru around 10pm and waited in the driver thru for 28 minutes until I received my food. The staff working the window were on their phones and the orders where all messed up. Very poor service. I never write reviews but I am truly dissatisfied.,0
2112,"The food was good but the cashier, Aquirah, had a terrible attitude throughout the entire encounter. I really wish they would hire employees that at least are nice to the customers.",0
2113,A trip to Chicago City is incomplete with a bite to eat at Portillo's! Service was polite and prompt and easy to find a seat. Food was tasty and fairly priced for a city.,1
2114,Must try! The place is so cool and the food is so good!,1
2115,The food there is VERY VERY GOOD OMG!!!!:) LOVED IT AND THE FAMILY DID TOO CAN'T WAIT TO GO BK TO CHICAGO,1
2116,"Food was outstanding, had both a dipped Italian beef and Maxwell Street polish - messed up and did not put in one of our orders but the manager handled it well after a rude server did not understand",1
2117,The chicago beef was delicious! So juicy and flavorful.  Would definitely recommend.,1
2118,Fun place!  Had the Italian beef and a Portillo hot dog.,1
2119,"Charming and spirited is the interior feel. Clean and cared for as well. I’m a vegetarian but I brought my family to eat the beef sammys which they absolutely loved! The chocolate cake was quite moist and tasty. I liked the fries… salty and crispy as they should be. I ordered a veggie dog which was a hot dog bun with a pickle and condiments. In retrospect, I think I should’ve ordered more fries instead but I wanted to try and see what the veggie dog was. Based on my family’s glowing reaction to the dipped beef sandwiches I think this place is pretty great.",1
2120,"Had the house special , the pepper is a nice touch to give it a kick. Chocolate cake is good too",1
2121,"Solid spot, I love the atmosphere. But if you are coming for the hot dogs, get the Polish sausage. Portillo's hot dog is not worth the money",1
2122,"The food is amazing. Their original hotdog, which has beef, pork and maybe chicken (they weren’t sure) is going to be worth your time.
The cake shake is not that good honestly, maybe stick to hotdogs if you are visiting and want to try Other places. We ordered a chicken sandwich, hotdog, shake and fries and it costed us around $40
It’s on the corner of the street, beautiful and very colloquial interior. Seating space is comfortable and they have a lot of it.
Service is fast, staff is very friendly!",1
2123,One of the best food experiences in Chicago! My fiancé lived in here for four years and we decided to visit the city over the weekend. The food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere ist undoubtedly Chicagan. The brick building filled with big band music had me feeling like I was in a film. I highly recommend trying this place out at least a few times. There are so many delicious things on the menu!,1
2124,"Best best best hot-dog i've had!
Love the location as well, it's huge and they also offer other type of food (italian-american)",1
2125,Man the Italian beef with an Italian sausage sandwich was the bomb diggity - good thing I do not live in Chicago because I would weigh 500 pounds,1
2126,"You cannot really go wrong here in Portillo's. There is various fast food around Chicago and suburbs but Portillo's is definitely my all time, I mean when I wanted to eat to a fast food or just basically when I wanted something to eat outside first thing that would come into my mind is Portillo's and yeah that is how I love them. They have various food selection in their menu now but I will always remain to their classic Italian beef and signature chocolate cake milk shake. Their Italian beef is definitely the food they have that I would not get tired to eat and next to it is definitely their Chicago-style hotdogs. Of course it is not only about the food, the place is always clean and the vibe is just something casual and kind of chill and fun especially if I am with my friends or family and last is their customer service. Staff in here are nice and friendly and service is always quick.",1
2127,"Icon a real staple in Chicago. Even if you don’t like hotdogs, you still have to go by and try one. Unbelievable.",1
2128,Nice hotdogs. Waited long time at the beer counter eith the good ready. Fast service overall.,1
2129,"We did dine in and the bun was soggy from the pickle juice soaking into it. Otherwise, hot dog was pretty good.",1
2130,"Awesome dogs, and cool place, glad I popped in.",1
2131,For reasons I won't type why; I'm not obligated to tell how well I was treated and not immediately turned down for owning a 🚲 but If you enjoy history and nostalgic vibes I'd love return to THIS specific Portillo's.,1
2132,You have to try the cake shake and the chocolate cake . Delicious beyond words . And the hotdogs were superb.,1
2133,Chicago dogs are fantastic. Not going to lie the reason we went is because my wife saw a video about the chocolate cake shake (it was delicious). The environment in the restaurant felt both themed and authentic. As a tourist I can say it is a place tourists will enjoy but I also think Chicagoans would also find something to like there.,1
2134,"It's essentially a giant food court inside. They have burgers, hot dogs, and pasta there. Got two hotdogs. The signature one was underwhelming. Nothing special in my opinion. The second one was a German style sausage which was much more tastier.
Decor is fun, great place for groups and families.",1
2135,"The food was delicious and I couldn't believe how cheap it was. I really thought I was going to pay more than $9 to try a famous Chicago dog, but less than $5?? This place is amazing!! And I loved the snap of my hot dog. Now you know that's a good dog! 😋 Yum!! I gave 4 stars because the staff is not very friendly. Such a shame.",1
2136,"We wanted to find out what the hype was about and all we found was overrated, salty hotdogs. The onion rings were overcooked and nothing special. Employees are rude and have no personality.",0
2137,Fantastic! My son said it was one of the best  cheeseburgers he's ever had. Dipped beef sandwiches and the onion rings are just delicious too. And the decor is pretty cool too.,1
2138,"Ordered a Cheeseburger, Hot Dog, and a Coke total was about $17. All the food was okay, not the best food I've had but not the worst. It's okay if you don't make it here on your Chicago trip you're not missing much this place is a tourist attraction. Also be sure to ask for a fresh drink mine was from the 30 pre-made drinks sitting on the counter that were mostly flat and a little colder than room temperature.",1
2139,"Portillos is a must visit for our Chicago trips and the Italian beef, Chicago dog, and polish did not disappoint.",1
2140,Overall great service & food. The lady working at the register was a little too quick & we missed a couple of things on our order. Otherwise a nice experience.,1
2141,"Came here to try the Italian beef dip sandwich. The sandwich did not disappoint. The meat was tender and flavourful. The sandwich is stuffed with thinly shaved beef, your choice of sweet or spicy peppers and cheese - then the sandwich is dunked in the au jus. I definitely recommend trying it.

The chicken tenders are very good as well. Not processed chicken.",1
2142,Although the wait was a little longer then expected it was worth the wait. Plus with all the decorations and history to look at inside it makes the wait feel quicker. We were able to find a great table with a view.,1
2143,Cheese fries all day! Def one of my fav spots in Chicago. Great food fun place great memorabilia as well. Can be very crowded be prepared for a wait during lunch etc.,1
2144,A fantastic looking space serving (among other things) classic Chicago hot dogs (which I didn’t find exceptional but totally ok). Worth going for decoration only!,1
2145,"Food and service was good, easy for kids.  No kids menu but lots of choices!  BEWARE!!!!  My wallet was stolen while in the restaurant out of my purse.  After this happened and my card was used at a store nearby the manager of that store told us Portillos is hot spot for teams working to steal wallets/purses.  Please be careful, my purse was on my chair with my coat over it, no idea how they got into it but they did.  There’s lots of people in and out of the restaurant.",1
2146,"From SC on vacation to IL. If you to know where to go to get that Chicago dog, check this place out. It looked like a small food court and was a popular place. It even has a drive-thru. We stopped in to eat for a snack.",1
2147,Idk what the hype is about. Terrible hot dogs. Really a let down. Didn’t get my order right and charged me extra for something I didn’t order. Make sure you double check your order,0
2148,"Horrible experience.
Waited 45 minutes from time of ordering for 1 hot dog and fries.
Then food was cold.
No thanks",0
2149,The food was decent but the service was horrible.  This would not be a place I would recommend to tourists but the service did not do Chicago justice.,0
2150,Was not to bad but wasn't great the chocolate cake shake was good as was the dog. The fries were a bit limp and the strawberry dessert tasted a bit old.,1
2151,"The place didn't disappoint at all. Had a really good Chicago style hot dog and it was for a reasonable price.

I unfortunately went at Lunch hour so took me about 20 mins to get my order.

They got burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, salads, chicken you name it. This place lives up to the hype everyone recommends.

Just be sure to go after 3 pm to avoid the crowds, because this place is popular.",1
2152,"A friend recommended I should get the ribs... And they were right! Delicious. Portillo's does so much more than hot dogs.
Lots of indoor space at this location, so you shouldn't have trouble finding a seat.",1
2153,"We go here every time, good quality and service!",1
2154,This place is great! Busy and eclectic. The food is good and family friendly. Prices are affordable especially on Chicago standards. Kind of touristy but so is most of downtown Chicago!,1
2155,Great place for Italian Beef sandwich or a Chicago Dog!  I had both!,1
2156,"The cake shake was incredible, best shake I have ever had. Had the Italian Beef as well, only regret was not getting peppers with it. Really enjoyed the environment.",1
2157,"One of the best fast food restaurants in Chicago.  I brought people from London here to try my favorite beef sandwich, Chicago hotdogs, and a Chicago Polish. They did not disappoint. Got to love Portillo's there is something for everyone.",1
2158,"Delicious! Crispy crinkle-cut fries, the burger is like a better whopper, and the hot dog flavors blend together perfectly (I was a bit apprehensive but damn whta a dog!).",1
2159,"Food is ok, but service is terrible. Took over an hour for a hot dog and beef and it wasn't that crowded.",0
2160,"Our order took 1 hour and 20 minutes from the time that we placed the order to the time it got delivered to us. We ordered through Door Dash and the order went through three Door Dash drivers - the first two drivers abandoned the delivery after showing up to Portillos and because the order wasn’t ready when they showed up. We ordered the Italian beef sandwich and it was disappointingly dry and bland. The polish dog was ok - it wasn’t great but it wasn’t horrible either. We also had the spicy chicken sandwich - it was spicy and pretty flavorful. All in all, we don’t recommend this place and won’t be returning as there are other places that serve better meals.",0
2161,Really good hot dogs definitely Chicago’s best! They have a very speedy service and the quality of the food is spectacular. They give free refills on drinks and prices are not that expensive on food.,1
2162,"A must in Chicago. Great sandwiches and  Chicago style hot dogs. Great atmosphere and jazz oldies. Don't miss the Italian Beef sandwich, it's messy to eat but utterly delicious.",1
2163,"Terrible place, horrible food and rude staff. This place was recommended for its hot dogs and as A hot dog guru, I can say they are willing to have variety but the taste is the worst. I could not finish any of the 4 options I ordered, one of the sausage even had a plastic. When I ordered the food, I explained it was my first time and the guy was upset for my delay and one question of his recommendation. He did not even care to explain me any of their ordering and pick up. When I ordered beer, there were some glazing cups but I got plastic becuase the very rude waiter did not have time to find one. Not recommended. There are btetter options, in Navy pier there is one delicious and fresh.",0
2164,"How can you go wrong at a place like this? I’ve come several times & although it’s a tourist spot, it is for a reason. The food is consistent & good. I wasn’t blown away but it’s a must to visit in Chicago.

The Italian beef was one mighty sandwich. Get it extra wet at least, I added cheese. If you’re into spice, make it spicy. The whole thing was delicious.

You can’t go wrong with a Chicago style dog either. Get the jumbo if you’re extra hungry. It has poppy seeds on the bun & a whole lot of goodness inside of it. Pickles, relish, tomato..etc. You won’t find ketchup on a Chicago dog. It’s a sin!

The shakes are amazing too. Try not to get everything as you’ll most likely have to be rolled out.

Pay attention when you walk in because there are two separate lines. One for the chopped salad & pasta then one for the beef & hot dog. You order then go to a separate window to pick up. Upstairs seating available on those busy days, which is all the time even on weekdays at lunch time.",1
2165,"Must have if you're in Chicago,  Italian beef is the best but their dogs are good too",1
2166,"I decided to order a bowl of pasta(montaccioli), which was odd since the place is renowned for their hot dogs, but I really wanted pasta. Waited 30 minutes while my friends got their food, then found out my food was sitting on the counter at the other side of the room for 10 minutes, called out loud in an incredibly busy and loud restaurant with no loudspeaker. I give it a 2 because the food was really good, except for the bread, which looked like it had been stepped on. Service sucks, but food is great. If you're lucky, you'll have a decent experience.",0
2167,First time having a Chicago style hot dog and it's dangerously good! First visit was with a food tour and them came back the next day to try their Beef and Cheddar on a croissant and WOW. Definitely a must to get a tast of Chicago feel for any trip!,1
2168,"Doordash delivery - last time forgot chocolate cake, today forgot French fries.... it's not that difficult to check the bag make sure everything is there, before driver leaves..",0
2169,"My first time at Portillo's this last trip to Chicago and I think we ate there 4 times, fun place to go and the food was great.  Glad to know I can order online for delivery when I get the craving here in Nashville!",1
2170,"Waited an hour and didn't receive my order.  We left, as did many other visitors.  Lost an hour!  I highly do not recommend!",0
2171,Dogs and cake are awesome! Prepare yourself for a long wait though. Cool atmosphere.,1
2172,"I never post reviews, but this had to be done. Literally such terrible service & the food was nauseating. You would think placing an order online would mean your food’s ready quicker or that you’re prioritized - that’s definitely not the case. Waited over a half hour after my order was placed for ONE item! What got me more mad is that my order was ready on the side for a while but the girl working pick up orders was too busy leaning on the counter to check, so I asked someone else. I open my order 20 minutes after leaving only to find that my pasta was literally drowning in OIL .. never in my life have I seen such oily pasta. Made me loose my appetite. I would’ve gone back if it wasn’t so late and I wasn’t so far already. I most certainly won’t ever be going back there again! Here’s some photos to prove it 🤢",0
2173,I am actually sad to say that this was a tad bit of a disappointment. It came highly recommended from multiple people and the beef sandwich even dipped just didn't quite have the flavor I was expecting. I would eat here again but I probably wouldn't tell a tourist that it was a must have.,1
2174,"I ordered the chicago style dog, chili cheese dog, fries with cheese and a double cheeseburger. My rating on the food is pretty high, and as long as you get the food your order your review will probably reflect a higher rating.  However when I first received my food, I was missing the burger. Ok, at least I noticed before I left so I stood around for another ten minutes to get it.

I suppose I had too much faith in them because when I came home, the double cheeseburger came with only one patty and no cheese. I considered going back but the headache of having to go all the way back didn’t seem worth it. Just extremely disappointed that they just had one mistake after another",1
2175,First time having a Chicago style hotdog. Went here first because it was two blocks from the hotel. Overall I like all of the toppings that go into making it a Chicago style. I wish the hotdog had more of a snap to it when bitten into.,1
2176,"After countless reviews and recommendations, I came to Portillo's for dinner on the weekend. As I was in Chicago for the first time, I couldn't pass up such a top rated restaurant.

First, the place was PACKED. I came at 9pm and the line took a while. I wasn't sure what to order (the menu is huge), so I asked the cashier what are the top items and she suggested the hot dog & the Italian beef sandwich. So me & my fiancé ordered these - just plain. No extra toppings added.

We waited for 20 minutes, knowing it would be a long wait, especially with all the people ahead of us.  They continued to shout order numbers higher than ours, but I figured their orders were easier to make so we just waited it out. After 38 minutes of waiting, I finally asked what was taking so long for a plain hot dog, and an Italian beef sandwich (literally both just meat + bread). They looked into it and I heard one employee say that our order had just been sitting there for a long time.....  They ended up remaking our order (thankfully).

My Italian beef sandwich was soaked in the au jus, so the bread was soggy and unpleasant (I now know that you can order it with less ""gravy"", or even none). There wasn't any huge flavour, so I'm not sure why this was such a huge hit. The polish hot dog was good (much more flavour), but it was super greasy and the bun was dripping in it.

I'm disappointed for having to wait almost 40 minutes for a hot dog and sandwich.. granted they were super busy, but the wait was NOT worth the food. I wish I would've went to the McDonald's across the street! I'm sure the employees would've been nicer, happier, & got my order to me in a timely manner...",0
2177,"This is one of two places i love to eat Italian beef combo at when visiting chicago. While there are many other places in downtown, i love the convenient location and hours, plus beer served right there. 26 bucks for 3 people (2 sandwiches, 1 dog, 2 fries and two bottles of water) is hard for my Californian mind to comprehend",1
2178,"Portillos is great! We originally had an issue with an order and doordash, but when we went to the restaurant the management was amazing at getting it fixed asap. The hot dogs are good, chopped salad is amazing! It was busy when we went but seemed to move along quickly.",1
2179,Excellent hotdogs with fresh buns that will melt in your mouth!  The lineups are crazy long so make sure u order more than one hotdog as they are pretty tiny.  Fries were hot and fresh and tasted great with the cheese sauce.,1
2180,"Oh my god I was home. Stopped here with my brother and it tasted just like I remember. Even though we were there in the middle of lunch, we got served quick and it was amazing. You must go here whenever you visit Chicago. I am going to order online and have it sent to me in Dallas.",1
2181,No doubt! Always one of my favorite places to visit when I’m hungry or a switch up from my daily asian food.,1
2182,"This will be an unpopular opinion after so many people recommend it to me. I love Italian beef sandwiches, so ordered one with extra gravy and peppers. Unfortunately, the meat and sandwich was dry and mostly flavorless. The service was friendly and the restaurant was very clean and had a nice atmosphere. Might be worthwhile to try some other things on the menu; but, the most recommended item was a disappointment for me.",1
2183,Very average food. Always has been. Never understood why people like it here except the chocolate cake shake.,1
2184,Be prepared for a long line but for good reason. The Italian beef sandwiches are amazing!,1
2185,"Started closing seating areas and didn't allow customers to dine in around 10pm because they said they close in an hour. Had to go back to my hotel to eat my food. Was looking forward to the onion rings, but they were so burnt I couldn't even enjoy them. Never again.",0
2186,"It was very noisy and chaotic in this place. Confusing ordering & collection system. The constant booming of the PA system calling out orders grated on my nerves. My “large” hotdog was tiny and the bun was soggy and they also got my wife’s pasta order wrong. The iced tea was tasteless. The hotdog in my local Costco puts this one to shame. Unimpressed and would not go back, despite a lot of people recommending Portillo’s.",0
2187,"Who puts cheddar on an italian beef? What is this Arby’s???

Very disappointed my order came with cheddar cheese instead of the mozzarella I requested on my italian beef.

Hey river north Portillo’s, if you don’t like traditional Chicago italian beefs... go back to Philly!!!",0
2188,"Place was super dirty, disorganized and we also received poor costumer service. I wanted to eat and live the Chicago experience but this totally ruined our night.",0
2189,"What can you say? A must for any visit to the Windy City. Gotta have the Italian beef, dipped and cheese for your fries. Food comes fast, great atmosphere, and tons to see while you eat.",1
2190,So good! We were in town visiting and wanted the authentic Chicago dog experience and Portillos delivered! Loved the decor and ordering was quick even with a long line.,1
2191,I've ordered from this Portillo's many times over the years and had a few mistakes on a few orders but the food always seems to hit the spot. I think Portillo's food can never get old. I highly recommend!,1
2192,Although this restaurant is crowded and the hot dogs are smaller than expected the taste is undoubtably there. I have never tasted a more fresh hot dog in my life. They rival dirty water New York City hot dogs and I would definitely go back for seconds.,1
2193,"Got the hotdogs and Italian sandwich. I enjoyed the hot dogs more, and added sweet and hot peppers. 10/10 !",1
2194,Delicious fully loaded hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches in a creatively decorated and comfortable environment.,1
2195,Must have hot dogs in Chicago! So well organized and great service. Very unique place!,1
2196,"This place is great, a local landmark with all kinds of sports and celebrity photos and banners. The dogs are the best and reasonably priced.",1
2197,I got to Chicago dogs and some french fries the hot dogs were excellent and the people working there were incredibly friendly. If you are in Chicago you absolutely have to try this place,1
2198,"Known for their hotdogs, but don't overlook their desserts.  Dave room for the cake shake.",1
2199,"Best Chicago style hotdog ever!!!
Service was quick
Price was reasonable
We had two dogs and a drink for almost 10$ and it came by quick (ps: it’s kinda small but worth it)",1
2200,The chili cheese dog was tasty and the fries were perfect. The chocolate cake was surprisingly good too.,1
2201,"The food was great, service terrible. I had walked for 40 mins to get there through snowy wet weather after the restaurant was recommended to me. The young lady who took my order seemed to be rather lacking in customer service, and her body language suggested that she would have rather been at home painting her nails. As i said before, the food was great and persuaded me not to track down the manager to complain about the service.",1
2202,Awesome hotdogs!!! Service was fast when we were there.,1
2203,This was by far one of our favorites spots to eat. Been around forever and you can tell why. The dog is obvious but the hot beef sandwich (which I recommend dipped) is so tasty. Another thing we found out when we got there was that they had a cake shake that was really really good.,1
2204,"It was good but the ordering was a little confusing and the other patrons were a rough crowd. Also, a member of our party came back from the washrooms after our meal and an employee was in there who definitely did not wash their hands upon returning to work!",1
2205,"I had a polish dog and regular dog. It was delicious, and not that salty.  Definitely my go to place while I'm in downtown.

Update! Tried their Italian beef. Beef is so tender and not salty. Get both hot and sweet peppers . I prefer it dipped.",1
2206,I came here from out of town and was told this the spot for good hot dogs. I got the classic Chicago style coney and it was everything they said. They could have better fries and cleaner lines to order food but aside from that they are really fast and friendly.,1
2207,"One of the best hot dogs I've ever had. I'm typically a plain mustard type person, and this blew my mind. The combination tomato and mustard and weird neon relish is no joke. It's a winner in my book.",1
2208,"Great food!  I loved their hot dogs, fries with cheese and salad.  Outstanding service!  Low prices!  I highly recommend this place.",1
2209,"First time there ,the method to get your food is to elaborate and there is not parking",1
2210,"Do NOT do catering from this place… WARNING!!!! Not only was my order messed up, I called from 11 pm until 6pm and still didn’t get a manager on line or any results on my order. I called guest services and the representative stated it’s been a year that the Portillo on Taylor has been understaffed and I will not get anyone on the phone. So I must dispute my transaction with my bank,wow. I gave one star cause I had to and the delivery driver was great , on time and a nice person!
If you’re craving  Portillos visit the downtown Chicago location to satisfy your need.",0
2211,Place has good cheese fries and easy place to find a spot to eat but takes a while to get your food back. Chicken noodle soup was yummy but seems like they use canned chicken so It would be better as just noodle soup.,1
2212,"From the Mom and Pop restaurant feel to the vast selection of food, Portillos is no question the best Chicago dog in town!",1
2213,"Well, I was a bit disapointed, as a first timer, the place is confusing, I was not sure where to line up to get my food, if you want beer, it’s another line up. Food itself was ok, nothing real special about the hot dog I had, bread was a bit wet. Cheese fries are a good idea. Can get real crowded.",1
2214,"We spent $30 for 2 adults; ""fast food"" 😯. Had Chicken Alferedo and Italian beef sandwich as main dishes. Also, 2 soft drinks and fries were  ordered.  Funfair without  much good to write about food.  Staff and ambiance are nice.  Too crowded, seemed like, you may or may not get a table depending upon the situation.

It was highly recommended but did not fulfill the expectations. No plans to go back there.

Pic: Chicken Alferedo.",0
2215,"Great dogs. Busy crazy place. Wife had the Italian Beef, we had hotdogs. Had to take one back due to prep error. Food is good. Must visit while in Chicago.",1
2216,So so good!! And FREE cake on your birthday that is SUPER yummy!!,1
2217,Food is the best! Hits the spot everything we come to town. The downtown location is always busy but they have a fairly quick system to get you in and out. The wait may be a little longer than other Portillo's,1
2218,Was good just a little spicy. We got the sausage and beef combo and we also got the kids shakes. They were very good and the price was very reasonable. I will definitely eat here again if we come back to Chicago,1
2219,My family and I love this place and the food is so good.,1
2220,Was so much fun!!,1
2221,"Portillo's gives off a sizable food hall vibe where you place your order and then wait for you number, and expect long waiting lines and it to be packed. Get their Italian beef sandwich DRIPPED if you want it the Chicago way and add some hot peppers if you can handle the heat!",1
2222,The beefs are the best! Ordering can be a little confusing since there are multiple lines to order food from. Sat out on the patio be careful there are some strange characters that walk onto the patio asking for food or selling stuff.,1
2223,We were visiting and parked on the street for 45 minutes. It was probably over an hour wait easily for both sides. If you get  just pasta it was ready sooner. Which was excellent and so was the Italian beef and their famous polish. Really great food. Can't wait to go back. Also just didn't give 5 because I asked for my sandwich not dipped because it gets soggy but still enjoyed it,1
2224,"You need to try the Portillo's Hot Dog 🌭, is really good. The restaurant have a Long line to order, but the line move fast.",1
2225,Great hotdogs but the Greek salad was also good.,1
2226,"Better than average. 4 stars for putting a lot of cool ingredients into their ""famous"" dog and a good bun but it's not different enough flavor wise or presentation wise to care about ever going back. Pink's is better and I have zero allegiances to coasts or regions. I just want great, unique options and if you're ""the best"" or ""famous"" for something, you better BRING IT.",1
2227,"A - MAZ - ING !!!

It was beyond delicious.  Can't wait to come back. We went for all of the staples and they did not fail.",1
2228,"This place serves great food. All Portillos serve great food. The burgers are perfectly charred. The sausages are crisp. The salads are...well I wouldn't know, but I assume they're good too. The seating is fine, and the atmosphere is fine too.

But this place is too busy for the way they do business. Portillos has kind of an old school service method, and that method isn't able to keep up with this prime downtown location's foot traffic. Ordering is fine, but hectic. Getting your food is a different story. If you're from out of town and not used to being pushy and assertive to get what you need, it'll probably be annoying. You kind of have to push your way up through a crowd and work hard to get the service counter person's attention once your number is called, and that's not an easy task when fifty other people are trying to do the same thing.

In short, great food. But they need to increase staffing or entirely rethibg their service logistics to make this a great experience.",1
2229,"If you are in Chicago, you must visit Portillo's!",1
2230,Good food and plenty of space to seat and enjoy your meal!,1
2231,First timers in Chicago and had to try! Absolutely loved the Portillos original hot dog (forgot to take a picture) and Italian beef sandwich!,1
2232,If you are visiting Chicago this really is a MUST-go!! Actually went two days in a row to taste EVERYTHING!,1
2233,"Packed and long lines were annoying. The staff was very efficient. Food was decent. We had penne a la vodka, sausage, Caesar salad and chicken sandwich.",1
2234,"From the outside, it honestly looked like a small, humble hot dog place, but when I entered it. Boy was I surprised! It was so pretty and comfortable. A lot of space and a lot of places to choose. The line was long, so I knew that was a good sign. The hot dogs were big and delicious and the meat sandwich was one of the best things I've ever had! It was juicy, well cooked and seasoned to perfection. They have an interesting menu, with many things worth a try. Really loved it there!",1
2235,"Had to visit after all the recommendations. If you have time for only one stop for a true Chicago-style hot dog, make it this place. Be prepared to wait in line, but they are fast and there's ample seating.",1
2236,"enjoyed the chocolate cake shake and the hot dog! 4 stars because it took 45 mins to get our food and service was pretty bad. granted, this place is nearly always busy !",1
2237,"The hot dog with poppy seed bun is delicious. However, the crowd people really drove the clerks crazy. The clerk in pick up area surrounded by the crowd kept calling the order but nobody showed up. Fortunately,  I got my hot dog fastly. Everything was great except for the ordering problem. I almost forgot to put my meal bag in the bucket on my left side after paying.",1
2238,"I love Portillos , cheap delicious food. Anything from the hotdogs to the pasta is worth it. I flew from NYC to Chicago just to have it. Also they have cake shakes which is a milkshake with a whole spice of chocolate cake it. Very good. The wait can be a bit but nothing crazy. Really cool environment.",1
2239,Had to try an authentic Chicago dog while we’re here! This place was hopping! Good dogs and great atmosphere.,1
2240,"Super fresh ingredients, great balance of flavor, classic ball park style dog! Should be on everyone’s bucket list to eat!

The atmosphere is the essence of Chicago.",1
2241,"Great Chicago Dogs, Italian Beef with Sausage, Maxwell Dog, Meatballs and CakeShakes. Atmosphere was Very Pleasing. A must meal",1
2242,FIRST TIME HERE. I am visiting from Seattle and asked for the best of Chicago. Inside I was overwhelmed by the volume of ppl and the process to order and pick up my food. I was surprised how efficient the system was. There was plenty of seating upstairs. The interior decor is full of antiques or replicas and clearly Chicago.,1
2243,"Waited 1.5 hours for food. Other people were waiting almost 2 hours and many more had their orders incorrect. Because it was a Chicago staple, we went. Would not do again.",1
2244,"I will definitely come back for the Italian beef sandwich...super good. Service was fast. Chicago style hot dog was good, but not as good as the hype.",1
2245,Get the Polish sausage. Skip the hot dog. It was nothing special. Plenty of places carry the flame in Chicago far more faithfully.,1
2246,Chicago dog was everything I wanted it to be. The Italian beaf left much to be desired. Loved the atmosphere and the service was excellent!,1
2247,OMG the flavors! Beef & Sausage sandwich was 🔥 🔥 🔥.... The bro got chicken tenders and those were actually bomb too.,1
2248,Best Hot dog in chicago. Beautiful place.  Nice staff!,1
2249,"As we were walking around Chicago late one night, we ended up at Portillo’s! We loved the hot dogs and the atmosphere. Great way to end a long day.",1
2250,I enjoyed my meal.  I just started doing keto and they had a beef sandwich in a bowl no bread.,1
2251,Oh man. This is is like my Pat’s for the Midwest. (I dare say the steak could be better). Grab a beer and soak up that bread with giardiniera and au jus.,1
2252,"Must visit place. Be hungry! Get pasta, pesto and fetucini alfredo were rich, get hot dog, cake is very average, hamburger is ok.",1
2253,"Hotdogs are delicious : an absolute mus try when in the USA. Tried the onion rings (very crispy, good but no more) and the chocolate cake shake which had actual pieces of cake in it. Found it too grainny to my tastes.

Would go there for hotdogs only.",1
2254,DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. i found a dead tick fully baked into my french fry. this is unacceptable and disgusting!,0
2255,Always fast service and delicious food every time.,1
2256,"Great restaurant with great vibes. Food was good, we ordered their traditional italian beef sandwich with gravy (locals say it's best this way). It was good, but the sandwich was dry even with the added gravy.",1
2257,The food was great & the restaurant looked quite intricate. The price & the speed was spot on. I would return here again!,1
2258,The beef hot dog here is amazing! Fries were also seasoned well and crisp! Will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago!🤤,1
2259,"Visited twice. Once for a Chicago-style hot dog, once for a beef sandwich. Both were terrific. Fun atmosphere",1
2260,"The chili was so small I ordered a small but it was so small I thought it was a sample cup, The spaghetti was so bad I thought it came straight from a ca🐵",0
2261,"We enjoyed the Italian Beef and Sausage sub and the Chicago Dog very much, just be ready to stand in line for a while. It's worth the wait.",1
2262,Hot dog is as good as they say. No ketchup here. Enjoyed with a Revolution Brewing Anti-Hero IPA.,1
2263,Great food! Had a classic vanilla milkshake and beef and cheddar croissant. Definitely need to go back to try everything else.,1
2264,"Food was amazing
We loved the atmosphere
The kids wanted spaghetti and a meatball and they could have easily shared one.",1
2265,This has been the worst experience of my life i’ve been eating at this location since I was a child just recently moved back to the city waited 45 minutes for my food  my feet was sticking to the floor come to find out the Lady calling the numbers gave my food to someone else and then the manager gets upset with me because I got tired of waiting 45 minutes  and wanted a refund if you’re gonna go to Portillo‘s avoid this location,0
2266,Great hot dogs but be weary of the 30+ minutes it takes to order and get your food due to the sheer number of people,1
2267,So good. I don't eat meat but they had Garden dogs! Worth the long line for the food and experience.,1
2268,Great Chicago staple. Service is sub par. Still stand by their Italian beef and chi style hot dogs.,1
2269,Ordered a chi-town dog... Soggy bread. One slice of tomatoe. Friendly and polite service. Cooks gotta step it up and pay attention to detail.,1
2270,The best!,1
2271,"Just too good

Pickle is fantastic !

Don't leave Chicago without trying em",1
2272,"I went there for the Chicago-style dog (which was delicious), but also got the Polish sausage dog and it was amazing.",1
2273,"Place is packed but totally worth the wait. You just have to be quick in grabbing seats. We got the chicago style hotdog of course and it didn't disappoint us. The place offers a variety of food, too.",1
2274,Their crinkle cut fries are my favorite. Love their hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. Not a fan of the cake shake - too sweet and a chunky texture.,1
2275,Yeah it was awesome. Chicago style hot dogs and an atmosphere to match. 10/10. Colllddddd beer too!,1
2276,Sitting in driveway more than 30 min the speed up team  they can be fired for bad attitude ! Asking the speed up member to move the car in a front of me  because we already waiting 30 min or more  ! This is the most disrespectful peoples I ever meet !stay away from this seller!,0
2277,Delicious tasty hot dogs and the cake mix drink was a little sweet but definitely a must try.,1
2278,"Friendly staff. Great hot dogs. Seating upstairs. Chill place to get a dog, dawg.",1
2279,Good food.  Variety.  Fast.  Retro.  Great value!   Crowded but efficient.  Amazing to watch the food prep.  Must go!,1
2280,Love this place have went there everyday since I been in Chicago. U can't go wrong with the Italian steak sandwich. So good highly recommend.,1
2281,ORIGNAL hotdog’s is to die for. The ambiance the flavor is so good. If you are traveling to Chicago make sure you try this.,1
2282,"Portillo's was a unique experience for me. Anglicized Spanish su-rnamed restaurant with a  menu of interesting items.  Picured below ks the beef and sausage sandwhich which was served soaking in au jus.  I also had a Cake Shake, which was  chocolate cake piece mixed in a shake.  I later had pasta, and tried their tamales.  It was all unique and good.  I think the place is somewhat didorganized, but they got us thr food and it was good.",1
2283,DELICIOUS!!! You will feel stuffed after eating here. The bread of this Beef steak sandwich highly recommended to be dipped to be extra delicious.,1
2284,"Portillo's Hot Dogs is the Greatest.  Everything they make is Awesome.  I especially Love there Italian Beef sandwiches, and it doesn't cost you an arm and a leg. Plenty of room , and you can even eat out side.",1
2285,They got behind so stopped taking food orders. The line to place orders was backed up to the door. When they finally started taking food orders they got behind again immediately. Worst service experience ever.,0
2286,Fantastic hot dogs and cake shakes! The service at this location was really good.,1
2287,"Nice place, great location, we expected something better, probably our expectations were too high for just regular hotdogs; the pasta was good.",1
2288,The food was amazing and Mama T is the best!! Hands down the best hot dog I’ve had in life,1
2289,"Quick service, and great food! I just wished they blended up my cake shake more. The bottom half of my large shake was just unblended cake",1
2290,"I disliked the service between ordering on their app, which doesn't give an option for picking up in the drive-thru, to the time it took me to get a simple order (30 minutes for a big beef and fries).",0
2291,"It okay and for all the hype my husband three my way, I expected more. It's a very strong food court vibe and the quality is suboptimal.",0
2292,After watch some videos about was great food was ok,1
2293,Visiting Chicago and had to stop at the staples. The Portillo dog and Chicago beef sandwich were everything that they were hyped up to be. Get the Italian beef extra juicy with hot and sweet peppers. The hotdog fully loaded was incredible and marked as a “healthy” because it has vegetables on it. Have returned twice already since the first visit.,1
2294,A Chicago institution with a fun and lovely atmosphere. A bit overrated: the lines can get quite long and nothing too special about their hot dogs or italien beef.,1
2295,"Pretty good hotdogs, but their chicken sandwich is even better in my opinion. The jumbo sized hotdogs aren't that big, either.",1
2296,"This was a restaurant like I have never experienced before! I went based on a recommendation by a friend to try something called the ""Chocolate Cake Shake"" and it was everything it was made out to be! Unfortunately i didn't have time to try anything else on the menu but I hope to return!",1
2297,"This is the definitive Chicago Italian Beef and Chicago-Dog place to go when you visit the city in my opinion.  My Wife and I tried this on January 23, 2022 and we loved it.  We got two Chicago Style Hot Dogs, two Italian Beef Sandwiches with peppers and onions, mozzarella and both dipped in the sauce, you have to have them dipped, it is the way to do it.  The location on Ontario Street is the one you’re going to want to go to.  It’s the one.",1
2298,"A staple of every trip that we take to the Chicago area. Wonderful beef sandwiches, crispy fries and eating out on the patio on a wonderful day makes it so much better.",1
2299,"Great beef sandwiches, Chicago style hot dogs and fettuccine Alfredo. Too bad it's hard to find any parking.",1
2300,"Great place to eat they have the best Italian beef, hamburgers, pastas, and salads I highly recommend this place",1
2301,Everyone is always saying how great Portillo's is. Maybe it's just this location that stinks? Crazy stupid ordering system - handwrite the order on a bag and send it down to be filled. Our order somehow got lost in their passing down procedure. And not one person even apologized. The food is definitely not worth the hassle.,0
2302,"Waited 25 minutes for our food. And then it looks like this. They ran out of cake - actually they had whole cakes that they weren't cutting - until finally an associate said if you don't mind waiting 5 minutes we'll cut up a cake.

lethargic, apathetic workers
""Mr. Portillo"" wouldn't be happy with this 😣",0
2303,"It's definitely one of my favorite fast food places to go. Good food, good atmosphere.",1
2304,True reviews! Food is great and so are prices with portions. must come to place when visiting chicago.,1
2305,"Don’t mobile order here, I waited three times the amount than customers who ordered in store.

Edit: talked to a worker, who said that if you mobile order you can expect to wait an hour at least, it’s better to order in store.",0
2306,Who doesn't love Portillo's! I take my out of town friends here if they want a cheaper meal that is delicious.,1
2307,Get a cake shake. The chicago dog was still just a hot dog. Atmosphere was good.,1
2308,"This is one of the best hotdog places I’ve ever been to, the staff is amazing and it is amazing to watch them work. The food is excellent quality in the atmosphere is extraordinary. Would definitely recommend it to anybody traveling to Chicago.",1
2309,My bad experience just left there bought a combination they put 2 strings of beef on it I ask extra dip it was dry the sprite was  half way full and it was watery down the drinks should  be made  not just sitting there never again  at least not this location and they are slow   15 dollars went down the drain,0
2310,"Delicious definitely hit the spot. I would know, I'm picky about my sandwiches lol.",1
2311,Food is good but service is slow and the people they have working the drive through needs to be retrained on customer service and how to direct cars in the drive through.,1
2312,Came all the way from Georgia and it didn't disappoint whatsoever.  Will gladly make the trip again! Loved the cake and the shake.,1
2313,"If you haven't been to portlillo's then you haven't been to Chicago, must try their Italian Beef. I love their chili cheese dog and Maxwell polish hotdog too, wait time can be huge on weekends but worth waiting and also may be hard to find a place to sit. Wide variety on menu and there is something for everyone!",1
2314,"A classic Chicago staple for burgers, hot dogs, beefs and shakes. The other side Barnelli's, offers really good salads and pasta dinners too. I eat here every single Wednesday night and it's always poppin'",1
2315,Beef sandwich was great and the decoration was very nice. 4 stars only because the queue was long and messy (need to walk through the crowd to get your order..,1
2316,First Chicago hot dog and the best hotdog  I ever had. These bags are empty! Nothing made it back to the hotel!,1
2317,"Seems to be a very popular spot. Organized for as busy as they are. Great customer service. I got the Beef n Cheddar with onion rings. Neither were hot but I don't think it sat for too long. Very tender but lacked seasoning
Interesting concept with the decor.",1
2318,"This is one of those places that everyone tells you to visit in Chicago, but we found better food and atmosphere in other places.",1
2319,My first experience eating a Chicago dog and an Italian beef sandwich.nice atmosphere kind of like a 60s diner with a western flair.,1
2320,Worst portillos in Chicago don’t even think abut going in the drive through Allways something’s missing and foods Allways cold and dry I can’t stand this place and if you try and call them to talk to some one no one answers,0
2321,Great place to try the classic Chicago hot dog. They also have a lot more choices so don't think it's just a hot dog place. I really enjoy the hamburgers too.,1
2322,Would have been better if they wouldn't have lost our receipt/order.  Waited 30 minutes and not even an apology for making us wait.,1
2323,"Exactly what you expect, excellent hotdogs with a great milkshake for a good price.",1
2324,"Chicago style Hotdogs, Polish Sausage and Italian beef, plus great fries!",1
2325,Long lines. Busy. Crowded. Loud. But... enjoyed every bit of it. The hot dog was good as was the chili. The building has a lot to look at. And the ice cream... err custard... was delicious.,1
2326,"Great place, my vegan options Chicago Style Dog was a hit!",1
2327,"My husband loved the hot dogs, and a little pepper man showed up. I had a salad that was pretty good. Nothing to write home about though...with long lines, long waits for food, and an incorrect order...",1
2328,Very unique atmosphere. Classic Chicago snacks. Amazing Italian beef!,1
2329,This place used to be so good. Now the burgers are gray but not charred. The hot dog buns are wet and fall apart while you're trying to eat them m the Italian beef and Italian sausage is still spot on though. Well organized for the amount of traffic they get. Definitely a go to for a quick lunch but nothing to brag about.,1
2330,Historic restaurant with delicious food,1
2331,"They move the line quickly, so don't despair, your got dog cravings will come soon enough!",1
2332,"Well designed large interior with at least 2 restaurants, both of which seem to have the same owner. Food court style system. Order at one spot, receive a ticket number and wait for them to yell your number at the pickup spot. Outdoor seating available. We tried the hotdog here. It was OK.",1
2333,"When in Chicago this is the place to go for Hot Dogs. These have been the best hot dogs in my life, simply amazing!",1
2334,"If you are visiting Chicago you have to go to Portillo's! It has amaizig Ribs and Hot Dogs. And as an Desert you have to try the chocolatrcakeshake. It is really great, I did not have anything like it before!
The price is ok for what you get! $$",1
2335,"This is really upsetting as Portillos has been a staple of go to fir Chicago style food since I was a kid but in the last few years the quality, service and over all experience has gotten very bad. I just went and got drive thru at a very low traffic time and ordered 3 things. This is the 3rd time in a row they’ve forgotten an item and the fries were too hard and felt like they were not fresh at all. I’m sad to say but I think I’m done be disappointed and will have to find Italian beefs somewhere else.",0
2336,"One the greatest, soggy hot beef sandwiches I’ve had in a long time. I’m only regret is not going here sooner in my trip.
High priced millennial yuppie places downtown have nothing on this joint for service or price.",1
2337,A Chicago classic. Get the all-beef Potrillos jumbo dog!,1
2338,"Good food. Chicago (touristy) staple. Polish street sausage is my favorite, good beef, good hamburgers.",1
2339,Great dogs and Italian beef.  There was a long line when we came but it moved quickly.  Greeter posted at front to direct you and explain the order process.  We came back a second time for cake shakes and chocolate cake.  They definitely have a huge following and it is well deserved.  Will be visiting next time we are back in town.,1
2340,Such a great place to eat and have a drink! Great view and great atmosphere! Totally recommend!,1
2341,"Great hotdog joint. Went there for lunch. Very busy and noisy, but the hotdogs are outstanding.
I ordered the jumbo hotdog and onion rings. Hotdog was the best I've ever eaten! Just a little small, but very inexpensive. Just get two of them if you are hungry",1
2342,Super fun experience!!,1
2343,THERE'S BEEN YEARS SINCE I WAS THERE. THE FOOD IS STILL DELICIOUS.,1
2344,Those were some amazing hot dogs. Definitely recommend.,1
2345,Nothing can be said that hasn't already been said. Delicious and one of the best Chicago restaurants for fast food.,1
2346,Hot dogs were top notch. People of Chicago had hyped up Italian beef sandwiches to me too much. However it did not live up to my expectation. Portillo's sandwiches were good but Italian beef sandwiches in general wasn't as amazing as I expected.,1
2347,Easily one of the best hot dogs ever. Loves up to the hype. Going back in this short 3 day trip.,1
2348,"The atmosphere was fun but it was hard not to think we were just in a glorified McDonald's. I appreciated the menu options, however the taste was okay at best.",1
2349,"Authentic Chicago style hotdog, with warm staff and cozy place to rest after long walk of the wonderful streets of Chicago",1
2350,"I was told to stop by here during a visit to Chicago. It was decent. The food was good, but the service was kind of a mess. A lot of people had to wait a lot of time for their food, all while standing next to a sign saying that it's one of the best ""fast"" food places around. If you're a tourist, I would recommend Al's over this place.",1
2351,"It is a wonderful place. It has delicious food, one of my favorites were the shake cake and the hot dogs.",1
2352,One of the best hot dogs I’ve ever had in my life,1
2353,"What's a trip to Chicago without trying the iconic styled hotdog? As a North Carolina girl who loves coleslaw, chili, mustard, onions, and ketchup on my hotdog -- I was eager to try the Chicago-style hotdog. It was very tasty! I recommend getting the jumbo dog instead of the regular. That will prevent you from getting a mouthful of pickles. (Yes, there's a whole pickle spear on the dog!) I also tried the Italian Beef Sandwich with both sweet and hot peppers. The sandwich was very good, but a little too messy for me. Also, just know if you get the sandwich dipped in gravy, it does not travel well.",1
2354,I came in and it was PACKED! However the gentleman that helped me was SUPER personable and friendly and made the wait worth it.,1
2355,I had the best sandwich I have ever had it was truly awesome the roast beef with extra gravy  everybody should try it,1
2356,"Long line for service.  Enjoyable atmosphere overall.  Friendly employees.  Super busy location, but we had to try it at least once on our visit.  The food was nothing to rave about. I had the Portillos Chicago Dog and hubby had the Italian Beef sandwich ""Portillo's Way.  Both were fine, but didn't meet the flavor expectations we had based on input from our friends recommendations.",1
2357,Awesome Chicago hotdog!!,1
2358,"The place was crowded. Not easy to park to get your take out but yes, it is Chicago and not the suburb. We were missing one item and did not check right away so we called the place and the meal was refunded. The food was as expected. The service was on time despite the very busy time. I have only positive things to say.",1
2359,Sooo good! Fun place. Was super crowded but the lines moved quickly.,1
2360,First time in Chicago and I had to try their chocolate cake milkshake. I must say! It was really rich in texture. We had dinner there and it was decent,1
2361,I never give a 1 unless the service turned left for no reason at all*. Example on this day I had a strawberry shortcake that sat in the cooler a while and had gathered extra juices from the strawberries that settled etc well my cake had so much I could not enjoy it . So I went to ask the line staff if I may have another based on this explanation she looked at me explained there Is some juice and I agreed as I've eaten this treat many times over ... I said some yes but this one is soggy and gross can I have another or buy another and she looked at me with the distain of all things and grabbed it tossed it and handed me another with no spoon to eat it with.  Her face was twisted and she had no respect for what I told her the cake was soggy and juicy which means over refrigerated and not selling first in's first outs etc ...  I was hurt because I was honest and spent my money but hurt in that she was not empowered to just fix it with a smile regardless of her analysis.. that would be real customer service in kind. Reviews are learning tools not bash a venue fest please keep this awesome establishment at the very top as they have always delivered an A + feeling on the line  was 51 just 51 not 51 your the one as you expect the funny order caller to do just off day here I'll be back and I'll update this accordingly no sweat at all !,0
2362,If you're coming here after 8 pm don't waste your time. They're super slow and have no sense of urgency be prepared to wait a minimum of 30 minutes,0
2363,Had a big beef dipped Italian sandwich and hubby had a beef and sausage combo. We split them and they both were delicious! Highly recommend!,1
2364,"Food is good, but they usually mix up and forget stuff in my order. Last visit  I had 2 workers looking at me weird & saying ""what you looking at"" which I wasn't being malicious or anything. I got home realized my ordered was messed up too, not first time either. I do love Portillos, just not this location.",0
2365,"We tried many ""Chicago"" dogs during our visit but Portillo's by far had the best one we tried.  My brother-in-law was kind enough to share his Italian Sandwich and WOW.  I will be stopping here every time I am in Chicago for one if each.",1
2366,"Very cool place to visit, I like the retro vibes that the interior of the building is giving off. There are lots of choices on the menu, and from what I saw from the kitchen and from what other people have said, a lot of it is really good (like the Italian beef). Of course, I had to try the hot dogs. Chicago-style is where it's at; all the toppings give a crunchy, textured bite. The way orders are taken maybe is not the most effective way to do it, but they do the best they can given how busy they are.",1
2367,"Iconic place. Long queues, but shorter wait time with quick service.",1
2368,DO NOT EAT AT THE PORTILLIO'S HOT DOGS LOCATED ON CLARK/ONTARIO. MY WALLET WAS STOLEN OUT OF MY BAG THAT I WAS WEARING. THIS LOCATION KNOWS THIS HAPPENS REGULARLY AND THEY DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.,0
2369,Amazing atmosphere. The whole restaurant is an experience. Great way to try out the famous Chicago dog for a very affordable price.,1
2370,Great food. Fun ambiance. Quick service even if the line looks long it goes fast. Clean restaurant and bathroom. Love the associate who greats you upon entering. Love their pepper and egg sandwich.,1
2371,"Great food and nice atmosphere. The hot dogs are quite small, one isn’t enough for an adult. Consider to order 2.",1
2372,"Great place to get hotdogs. Lots of stuff to look at while standing in line. The line had maybe 20 people in it, but it took less than 5 minutes to get through, during peak dinner hours. The chocolate cake shake is a unique and interesting idea. I normally don't eat chocolate shakes, but this one was great, and would definitely order it again.

The Chicago dog was really good. Good proportions of peppers to hot dog. The pasta with meat sauce was also really good. I did not leave this place hungry that is for sure.

It was worth the walk there, and I would do it again.",1
2373,"Only had jumbo Classic Hotdog and no complaints, great fast food in a great venue. Had to hold back one star - grumpy & gruff customer service could be improved.",1
2374,Amazing food and frozen margaritas the size of yor head! Very cool decor too.,1
2375,"Don’t go at night in the weekend because there will be a 1+ hour wait for rubber hot dogs on a soggy bun. Moreover, the tables will be sticky and dirty",0
2376,"Great décor, ambiance and food. The cake shake was even better than expected",1
2377,A Chicago icon I love to visit every time I’m in town! So many options and everything is fresh and tasty. Come for the hotdogs and try even more!,1
2378,I have never had a hot dog which tastes so good. Service is professional and friendly.,1
2379,"I loved the food, and then when we got the chocolate cake shake my world changed. Me and my sister fought over it. Love this place so much.",1
2380,Drive thru was pretty quick considering how busy they are! Delicious food.,1
2381,Great food. Italian beef is just too good.,1
2382,Awesome! What i look forward to Hotdog!,1
2383,"A really fun meal. Excellent Chicago dogs and Italian beef. They have beer. Hit the spot. Great value. Took some time to get order in and get food, but part of the experience. Felt like an authentic local Chicago happening.",1
2384,Very cheap and the place is super nice in the inside,1
2385,"Considering how this famous restaurant is, I was amazed how quickly they process orders!  Italian beef with sweet peppers and cheese fries were better than I remembered.  Definitely worth the one hour trip from Rogers Park where I have lived for over 10 years.  I still haven't found anywhere as easy to get to as Portillo's for such a true Italian beef with sweet peppers.",1
2386,"Sooooo good! It's ""fast food"" but it's so much more in delivery of an amazing product!",1
2387,Chocolate cake shake is as amazing as you would think. And the ribs are delicious. The Chicago style dogs are great too!,1
2388,Must try hotdogs in awesome place with friendly energetic stuff! I liked the atmosphere a holiday here. Luckily here was not crowded when we were here for lunch on a week day.,1
2389,"Food is alright, but picking up online orders is a nightmare. No one at the register, no line, just people crowding around in a cluster hoping to get their order. Waited an hour for my small order of two dogs when estimated time was 11 minutes. Other people were walking right up and getting their orders, but nothing for me. Never even got my order because I had to go back work. I'm never coming back to portillos. Wasted my entire lunch break on this and didn't even get my food.",0
2390,"Horrendous service when picking up an order. I have gone in three times now to pickup my order where it has taken over 15 minutes to finally get my food. While employees stand around and refuse to help, other customers purchased their food at the register, received it, finished their food, and left the restaurant before I was able to pickup my mobile order. Contacted customer service and they did nothing. Much better food in Chicago, don't waste your time.",0
2391,Hot dogs were ok. Sausage too thin not a lot of flavor.,1
2392,Always a great place to eat,1
2393,"This is one of those places where if you come in and don’t have a good experience, it’s most likely on you. One of the best places in Chicago, definitely one of the best hot dogs. It’s pure Chicago. Great service, polish was fabulous, and the environment is on point. It’s hyped up for a reason.",1
2394,"Best dogs and Italian beef sandwiches on the planet!  Wife had a grilled Portobello sandwich that was to die for.  If you are in Chicago and don't visit Portillo's, you are missing out!",1
2395,"loved the portillo’s hot dog! perfect combination of pickley and sweet. HOWEVER i was not a fan of the italian beef sandwich, wouldn’t recommend",1
2396,Just average place to eat. Quality has gone down over the years. Cake shake was not mixed well to me.,1
2397,"Great food, burger was a little lacking though compared to some other locations. Quick service and always a nice spot for more than fast food",1
2398,"Don't miss this place if you want a Chicago dog (easily the cheapest and best), or an Italian beef, dipped of course. Best value in Chicago!",1
2399,There is more to a dog than just its buns.  Prepare to wait like every other mega movie start that comes here with only one thing in mind... Everyone is in a que all the time.  Loved it!,1
2400,"It wasn't as special as I expected. Simply regular hot dogs with extra pickles, and chillies.",1
2401,A very good Chicago Dog. Nice clean place to sit down and enjoy a meal.,1
2402,"Great place to have Italian sandwich dipped. It's very flavorful. The pasta is alright, nothing special. The milkshake is a hit as well. I will come back if I am in town.",1
2403,"Great dogs, sausage, meat ball sandwich and grilled chicken (family of 4 dinner!)",1
2404,"Literally the best Italian Sausage EVER, and Chicago Dog. Reasonably priced too. Must stop by if you've never had it before",1
2405,"Worse hotdog I ever eat, the sausage look like it was made with rubber or hard plastic. My wife had pasta and said it was delicious. My beer was nice and in a big glass. The decoration inside the restaurant is awesome.",0
2406,"Wonderful location, tasty onion rings and milkshake. Unfortunately the bread for both our sandwiches was very soft and soggy.",1
2407,"Portillos drive thru in recent time has embarrassing, I honestly prefer going to McDonald's or burger king",0
2408,I GOT REFUSED ENTRY BECAUSE MY SERVICE DOG IS A PITBULL. THEIR CLAIM IS THAT THEY DONT ALLOW SERVICE DOGS.,0
2409,"Great Chicago dogs. I loved the Hawthorne. Next time will definitely try the Italian beef. Enjoyed a Half Acre, Daisy Cutter Pale Ale while I waited! Great fries and good overall experience.",1
2410,"Went on a Sunday evening. Not busy and no wait. Staff was friendly. Was excited to try some authentic Chicago dogs, but all the other reviews were right- SO bland. We had the beef sandwich and hot dogs and everything lacked flavor. The bread was soggy and the beef and cheese on croissant lacked cheese and flavor as well. Pretty disappointed.",0
2411,Simply the best Italian Beef- really good hot dogs and crispy fries.  Just outstanding and worth the trip.,1
2412,"This was my first visit here and The girl at the bar was horrible i was waiting in line next up and she saw me walk up then she walked away when it was my turn and after flagging her down after 15 min she literally said she is busy with soming else and walked away again , if this would of happened in California someone would of been fired on the spot garbage bartender",0
2413,Always an awesome classic Chicago experience.,1
2414,"Made an order for delivery, they charged for sauces and I bought several. When the order arrived, there were no sauces. Not a big deal, but I called to get the sauces knocked off my bill and I was hung up on several times, so it wasn't even worth the effort.",0
2415,Service was extremely fast despite being in downtown Chicago! Highly recommend every tourist check this place out,1
2416,"We enjoyed the hot dogs. The cake shake was underwhelming. I guess I just expected more from the hype. It's a cool spot, though, and the hot dogs were very tasty.",1
2417,Never disappoints! Out late? Come by. This place def knows how to take care of late night hangry!,1
2418,"The chicago hot dog is out of this world! Cute place, decor and atmosphere.",1
2419,Wow the roast beef on a hoggie bun dipped in juice is AMAZING i cant express how good it is love it also very nice inside like how they decorated it,1
2420,"I ordered a jumbo chili cheese dog with celery salt, how does that translate into a jumbo dog with everything.  This is not the first time this has happened to me.  I don't understand how it is that people get paid to do a job and they can not get it right. I have been on hold for so long.  Someone has picked and and said hello and when I said hello has put me back on hold two times. How is this good customer service?",0
2421,"Great hot dogs and beef sandwiches, also had a delicious pasta!",1
2422,Great Chicago Dog! Don't ask for ketchup to all the tourists out there :P,1
2423,"Visited the overhyped portillo and as a tourist, moved the concept of the restaurant, the internal streets, the decor, several food stations.  I was impressed.

I just didn't like the service could be faster.  The hot dogs were good.  Is worthy a visit, I don't think I'll do another one.",1
2424,Best hot dogs in Chicago and very inexpensive place to grab a quick bite.,1
2425,Love this place for a unique Chicago experience.  Everything's good!,1
2426,"I ordered the original Chicago style hot dog and a sausage and it was a good experience for a first time food wise. I took a star away because the staff taking my order was not very pleasant, actually seemed annoyed when taking my order not very helpful. I took another start away due to the counter areas being so sticky. I waited about 30 minutes or so and never saw about wipe them down but instead continued to take and give order on it. But no complaints about food. And I think the process is pretty efficient for the crowd.",1
2427,"Chicago style hot dogs are so refreshing - who knew a hot dog could be so good, sans ketchup! Great price too.",1
2428,"After listening to a coworker rave about this place, had to try it and the sandwich was great!  It was also a lot of food we had to carry out a little.",1
2429,"Very long wait, but worth it. Nice hot dog and the chocolate cake is to die for.",1
2430,Good food for good price. LONG LINES. Be prepared to wait 30+ minutes.,1
2431,"There is a right time and a place for everything. A Porillo's here in the middle of the heart of Chicago while driving around starving, on point, perfecto! Get in my belly and back to work.......",1
2432,"Great food, great service. I love the atmosphere. You order at the cashier and pick up food when they call your number. You seat yourself. They have plenty of seating space (they have upstairs and downstairs). One of the owners/managers came up to us and gave us some cake! We might come back later tonight even. I love their fries!!",1
2433,Very good food nice restaurant real busy but pretty fast,1
2434,Had a great time lots to look at. Awesome food.,1
2435,"The title beef hotdog is a must try! And it’s with tomatoes, onions, chili peppers and pickles.",1
2436,"Burger & dogs with the option of good salad.
Very nice!",1
2437,"Terribly ssssslllllllooooowwwww service.  Came during off peak hours..ordered 1 hotdog and took more than 20 min...and it finally came out only because we had to go ask for it.  A lot of the employees seemed to be either idling around or purposely working slow to look busy.  Definitely only come when you are not in a hurry.

The food itself was decent.  I guess the hot dog tasted of decent quality beef, which is better than expected from a fast food.  The relish was unnaturally green, but if that's how a Chicago dog is supposed to be, then this place nails it.",0
2438,Italian beef sandwich and Chicago style hot dogs were very good. Fun and entertaining environment.,1
2439,Absolutely delicious. Dipped beef sandwich with cheese fries. Very quick service too.,1
2440,Always great food at reasonable prices. Fast service. Great atmosphere.,1
2441,They somehow  forgot out orders. But made up for the mistake in so many ways. You can tell they want you to be happy to be there. Love this place.,1
2442,"Not so great hotdogs. The sausage it's just fatty, tha 'vegetables' look weird and not chopped properly",0
2443,"One of the best restaurants in Chicago! Every time I visit, I feel like my visit isn’t complete unless I visit Portillo’s at least ONCE. Their Chicago dogs are delicious, as well as the Italian beef sandwich. Their crinkly cut fries are super tasty, and the cake shake is to die for. Come try it!",1
2444,"Very upset. I am a local, i live just 3 blocks from this location and i frequent Portillos more than 2 a month. Needless to say i love it but the service lately has been absolutely horrendous . Normally i let things go and say ""its okay, they'll make up for it the next time i go"" well this hasn't been the case. I have now counted 4 orders in the row where my order has been wrong. Last night i ordered 2 chilli/cheese dogs and 2 L fries with cheese sauce and onion rings. Well we didn't get the cheese (but were charged for them) but received the onion rings but weren't charged for those. Quite frankly its lazy and embarrassing. Then when I went to go grab my food bags from the last window, i was given someone else's order.... like really!?",0
2445,They advertised char grilled hot dogs but if they were I couldn't tell. They were good tho and fun atmosphere!,1
2446,"Loved the hot dogs! And the ambiance feels very classic Chicago, definitely worth a stop here.",1
2447,Go for the Hot Dogs. Stay for the ambiance. We all agreed these were the best hot dogs we've ever eaten!,1
2448,Delicious hot dogs! Great family atmosphere. Good service.,1
2449,Amazing food and great atmosphere. One of Chicago's finest places to eat.,1
2450,"Great spot for good ol'American hot dogs, burgers, fries etc. I had the beef hot dog which was very flavorful which paired well with kringle cut fries which were excellent also.

This place has two levels for seating and a drive through.",1
2451,"This location had a system and if customers paid more attention, it would have worked flawlessly. That being said, the service was efficient and the food was tasty.",1
2452,"Fast service, good food... the cashier could be a bit more friendly, a smile doesn't cost a thing.",1
2453,Don't be deterred by the long line - it moves quick! I had the regular and large beef hotdog. I preferred the ratio of toppings to the regular size hot dog. It was heavenly!!! The Arnold palmer was so refreshing on the hot summer day!,1
2454,"Food was great, but the service was awful. The person at the counter was extremely rude and unwilling to answer any questions.",0
2455,"Great food had to try the cakeshake. It was good, just get ready for the sugar rush.",1
2456,"Good place with a fun environment, busy, but the service is fast. It's in a great location and pretty easy to get to in the city.",1
2457,The classic Chicago style hotdog at Portillo's is well worth it. Go try one and you'll see.,1
2458,Great food. Poor communication from the cook on how long it takes for something chargrilled when ordered,1
2459,"What a place!! Must try when in Chicago, food is delicious & got a try the frozen custard, Yummm.",1
2460,"last stop before heading home. interesting hot dog
considering I'm froom nyc. great Italian beef sandwich. must try if your in Chicago",1
2461,Good experience and vibe. Good honest food at reasonable prices.,1
2462,"Really great! Although, in my humble opinion, the shake (chocolate) wasn't anywhere near as good as Freddy's (not even in the same galaxy), the beef sandwich was awesome! The place has a GREAT atmosphere and very affordable. Really cool place. Q!",1
2463,"Good food and a Chicago icon. They can get quite busy though. Once you get your food, there's plenty of seating",1
2464,"When visiting Chicago, you definitely gotta try the Chicago dog at Portillo's! Watch out for those hot peppers. Italian beef combo is amazing too. Prices are reasonable and the food is great!",1
2465,"The food was great, but I wasn't super impressed by the service! However, the food was priced well and the atmosphere was great. I would go again for a fast food Chicago hot dog.",1
2466,Great place to experience one of the many versions of the Chicago Dog and the Italian Beef. Totally enjoyed our visit!,1
2467,Just make sure you not really hungry because it takes a long time to get your order,1
2468,"Classic Chicago Dogs, what could go wrong.  Charming setting and decor. Fast order taking.  Ample seating.  Friendly employees.  For the cost,  worth the visit,  even if it is touristy.",1
2469,"Quick and friendly service! Their Chicago style hotdog exceeded my expectations, and their dipped Italian beef was divine. Can't wait to have another meal here. Also, the interior reminded me of a highly themed Disney restaurant, really great atmosphere.",1
2470,"Tasty dogs at good price. I saw a staff wiping the tables. In some places where you take food from the counter, they never wipe the tables and it's obvious. It's gross and I never dine in. But it was not the case here.",1
2471,"As far as Portillo's goes, this spot is just okay. The food is generally what it's supposed to be, but the restaurant itself is almost always filthy. Maybe it's just me, but going into an establishment bathroom that isn't a full blown bar and the floors are sticky and there never seem to be toilet paper in the stalls seems like a red flag. Hopefully things turn around soon!",1
2472,Awesome hot dogs. Also got some chocolate cake and cheese fries. All bomb dot com.,1
2473,Had a blue glove in my Italian beef sandwich....not quite the experience I wanted,0
2474,"Ordered via uber eats while staying downtown. I havent had Portillo's in about 3years so I was really looking forward to it. However, I was pretty disappointed with the flavor. The beef wasnt very savory and tasted like old and plain roast beef from a bad deli. I thought it was just me but I talked to others about the experience and they mentioned that they dont recommend this Portillo's location. Hopefully they align their food standards with the other locations.",1
2475,Awesome! Came in a gentleman recommended a sandwich to my husband and he loved it! Came for a Chocolate cake shake and left with an awesome experience that we wont forget.,1
2476,"Great place, not expensive and really good food, if you are a meat lover, try the sandwich with Italian beef and sausage, just amazing!",1
2477,"Super tasty fast food joint, and very affordable for a big city. The inside vibe is cool, with local themed decor.",1
2478,This place is so good. The best ribs I've ever eaten.,1
2479,Great food. Very interesting place to eat. Something for everyone!,1
2480,"It was a good hot dog. Very interesting place-lots of memorabilia on the walls. Very busy, even though we went fairly early for lunch.",1
2481,"Good food and good atmosphere. I wanted something different so I tried the portobello mushroom burger. It definitely did not disappoint, it was super yummy and I am stuffed.",1
2482,Visited this location a few days ago while in Chicago. The food was very good and fresh. The service was fast even during a busy night. I wish they'd put the chili dog in a box instead of the paper wrapping so it's less messy but it was delicious. My husband also got the Italian beef sandwich and enjoyed it. The visual appeal of the restaurant was awesome. Full of Chicago history and just a fun place to visit - even during a pandemic. Keep up the great work Portillo's.,1
2483,"The food is very tasty yet the employees lack professionalism. The rude demeanor made it seem as if the individual's either doesn't enjoy their jobs or simply not trained in customer service. Although not a Chicago resident, I frequent the city often, yet don't forsee returning to this establishment.",0
2484,Awesome food and lovely place. Definitely will get obsessed!,1
2485,Great place to taste traditional Italian beef sandwich. The homemade sausage is awesome also. Service is fast but expect like to order it.,1
2486,OMG! What a find. Can't wait to come back to Chicago! Get thr Italian beef dipped. And the chocolate cake. Wow.,1
2487,"Yesterday I ordered on Grubhub as usual. If I could I would order directly.  The food I got
Yesterday was to worst I have ever gotten from Portillo’s.  4 items.  Reg beef sandwich-good as usual. Fries small-cold and soggy.  Cheese chardinair was not even delivered and chicken fingers-I guess okay but I’ll never order again. Didn’t like the breading.  I  saw there wasn’t even any cheese for the fries, one of my favorite items.  Probably will only order a sandwich again and nothing else.",0
2488,Bought a hot dog 🌭  & first bite was like a pop sound & it was just not good 🙊,0
2489,Always a staple when pulling up in Chicago. Never had a bad meal yet!,1
2490,"If the number and tone of the reviews don't tell the full story, their burgers, dogs, and fries will speak volumes.  Amazing!  If you have a healthy insulin response system, I suggest you try their chocolate cake shakes (but share it with at least one other person).",1
2491,Great food. A family favorite!,1
2492,The cheeseburger and onion rings 😍😍😍 were amazing   Last time I was on this restaurant 2015,1
2493,"Efficient drive through. Clean inside and you can see them make the food. Love the chili cheese dog, cheese fries, chocolate cake, and onion rings with a side of cheese! Seriously the chocolate cake is delicious, and the onion rings are crispy!",1
2494,Yum! This place was recommended to me by a friend at work. I'm glad I took their advice.,1
2495,"Portillo’s does it like no fast food restaurant does. It was 2 stories and menu was very fast. At the time of day we went, that place was bustling. It is a place you have to go if you ever visit Chicago.",1
2496,Loved the hotdogs. Was a little disappointed that it's pre-made. Makes the bread a tad bit soggy.,1
2497,"The food and service are always consistently excellent at all locations, and the River North location is no exception. This is my favorite restaurant for a true ""Chicago style"" dog!",1
2498,Good food + good prices + good service = great experience! My friends and I were only in Chicago for the weekend and we stopped at Portillo's twice!,1
2499,"I’m embarrassed to say how long it took for me to visit a Portillo’s after moving to Chicago, but after my first visit to get a true Chicago style hot dog, I’m never going back to life without them. I always thought hot dogs were kind of sad, boiled sticks of meat put into a sad soft bun. Not at Portillo’s! Their hot dogs have snap and pizzazz - in a poppy seed bun, topped with tomatoes, relish, mustard, onions, sport peppers and celery salt. Beyond the hot dogs, there are tons of other menu options, from sandwiches to sides and desserts, plus a full bar.",1
2500,"I never thought I'd ever rate Portillo's so low, but this one has easily the slowest drive through in existence (it's probably understaffed).  They then also forgot to give us our drinks and gave us 2 orders of fries instead of 3.  2 stars and not 1 star because the food is delicious.",0
2501,Delicious and easy. If you're ever in a bind - make a quick stop at portillos. Really can't go wrong with anything on the menu - but the maxwell street Polish is my go to.,1
2502,I had to drive from Wisconsin to buy my Wi-Fi portillo's beef sandwich oh I just got to have one I guess it was worth it I got lucky,1
2503,"One of the best Portillo's in Chicago if you ask me. Italian beef, sausage, Chicago hot dogs, Maxwell Street polish. All the good stuff. Oh and the he Chocolate cake shake. So good.",1
2504,Long wait...for an underwhelming hot dog. The bun was soggy and the condiments were just thrown in. It's definitely a tourist trap. But I guess I can say I've tried it.,1
2505,"Hot dog lived up to its billing.  Unfortunately the service was sub-par.  For what seemed to be a fully staffed establishment, the attitude of the employees could have been a tad more welcoming.  My daughter's Sierra Mist tasted like club soda, but rather than try to get it taken care of, we held off and just waited to get her a drink after we left (shared our beverage with her instead). We also had to try three different employees to get a cup of parmesan.  Glad to have tried this iconic place, but highly unlikely we'll be back.",0
2506,"Pretty good visit.  A bit of a wait for food but they were busy - so all good.  Had to try a Chcago dog and Italian beef sandwich.  We messed up ordering the dog but it was good.   Italian beef sandwich was REALLY good.   Wish we had more time, would have gone back again.",1
2507,So many native Chicago people told me this place was amazing sadly sadly I was very disappointed. The bread for the Italian style beef sandwich was extremely soggy. The meat was virtually flavorless. I was told the chocolate cake was to die for Again I was disappointed it tasted more like a Box cake mix with  store  brand frosting..,0
2508,Went in looking for a Chicago Hotdog and wasn't disappointed. Great flavor combo. Got cheesy fries on the side. What doesn't taste good dipped in meted cheese? Had a little bit of a wait to get in with the covid capacity restrictions but wasn't bad at all. Maybe 10 minutes. Great atmosphere. Overall delicious.,1
2509,"Quality was bad, we had to wait for over 45 minutes for 4 Hot Dogs. Unbelievable",0
2510,See the pic to the extra-big italian beef with polish sausage! I had it dipped and it was super delicious and super wet!,1
2511,"Don't be put off by the line here, it moves very fast.

YOU MUST try the Chilli dog. Best one I have ever had in my life.",1
2512,Delicious Chicago dog and beef and sausage sandwich. Cocktails and beer are an added plus. Ashley the bartender was very nice!,1
2513,Portillos is always a good go to for fast food!! I vowed not to go back after experiencing a cold fish sandwich on a previous visit but I gave them another chance and this time it was good!,1
2514,Busy place but well organized and friendly staff. Missing items were provided with no questions asked.,1
2515,"I was really looking forward to trying a Chicago style dog. But it was no where near worth the hype! I am gluten intolerant and asked if they would be able to do a lettuce wrap. They said yes! And it was quite clearly printed on the order receipt. Instead I received a hotdog wrapped in a wet piece of paper. There were no utensils offered anywhere!! If they had said ""no, we can't do a lettuce wrap"" Fine. If they had even given me a fork or spoon! Fine. Instead I had a sad pile of food that I had to try to scoop in my mouth while picking out wet paper wrap. Not worth the long wait time",0
2516,"Easy,fast,their drive thru was perfect I got what I wanted in record time",1
2517,"I was told that this was a must try experience in Chicago. Tried their Italian beef sandwich and it was a bit too dry but the onion rings were good.

Definitely try the cake shake though, literally have never had a cake blended into a milk shake before.",1
2518,I don't know about other visitors.But I didn't like it.Hot dog is also in Africa Hot dog.,1
2519,Great food. You must stop here to eat when you come to Chicago.,1
2520,Italian beef was overrated but the hotdog was primo,1
2521,Great food. Reasonable price,1
2522,"Always a great and quick treat you can count on. Never a bad bite and always the best service with a smile! Such a great place to bring the whole Family, a fun date or even a business break. Who ever you bring, they'll appreciate your great taste if food and fun. And always well worth the can't be beat prices. So come grab a hot delicious meal and a really cold drink.",1
2523,"The problem may be that there is soooo much hype to visit here, it's almost impossible to live up to it.  Don't get me wrong it's good and worth the visit, if not for any other reason than to tell people you went.  Hotdogs are solid, the dipped beef isn't my forte....soggy bread and all.",1
2524,"Fun spot I try to get to every time I’m here or in the suburbs. Go-to is the combo. Can’t miss; meat and meat!!
Coulda used a plate though.",1
2525,Original and simply one of the best,1
2526,You must go to this place while in Chicago! The location has a great vibe and is pretty unique. The food is great and very reasonably priced.,1
2527,Absolutely amazing! Get the Italian beef sandwich with mozzarella and sweet peppers!,1
2528,Excellent tamale I drive from Michigan . Cake shake too die for  good food great service chicago staple definitely . Michigan getting one soon can't wait,1
2529,Absolutely the best hot dog i have ever had.  A little chaotic at this location but worth every second of your time.,1
2530,"I have been to this location plenty of times, but recently had an issue where the cashier did not hand us our receipt with order number, I believe they threw it in the trash. It was just strange because they had to get another worker to come and reprint the order number. The workers seemed very overworked which I think is the cause of these confusions.",1
2531,"Delicious Chicago Style Hot Dog.
Staff was (un)-friendyl. But doesn't matter. Food was excellent.",1
2532,First time trying a Chicago-style hotdog. This place didn't let me down. It was delicious!,1
2533,"When in Chicago , eat Chicago. Some basic hot dogs.",1
2534,"One of my favorite spots when I visit Chicago. I love the Italian Beef with jalapenos, extra gravy, and a side of cheese fries.",1
2535,"Super busy, decent food, good place for Chicago dogs. They missed part of our order so that was frustrating, and it took a long time to correct. Not great beer selection, the slushy drinks are very sweet. All around I like it and will probably go back if I'm in the area, but not the best.",1
2536,Hot dogs and spaghetti were good. Some servers were rude and pick up was a bit weird,1
2537,"It's the best hotdog in Chicago. If you are on the fence about going, don't be! Imagine a perfectly steamed poppyseed bun with the perfect dog nestled between, lovingly. Atop of that, Chicago chaos with chopped onion, relish, fresh tomato, celery salt, an amazing crunchy pickle and some pickled peppers for that kick. I think some mustard too? A lot of great stuff going on. Draft beer was awesome too and served in a massive frosted goblet. Don't skip!",1
2538,I had the Chicago dog. I wasn't impressed. I have had better outside of Chicago. The place was busy so it seems like the locals enjoy it. If I'm in town I will try something else to see if it was just the hotdog I didn't like or the menu entirely.,1
2539,Really neat atmosphere. Food was great and the prices were reasonable!,1
2540,I left my backpack there and they were able to find it love those guys,1
2541,"I don’t understand the hype. Nothing about my experience here was great.

My hot dog was cold and not great. The setup of the restaurant itself is pretty chaotic too.",0
2542,Not good. I was so sad. Visiting from out of state wanting a good Chicago dog and it was so soggy and the inerds of the hot dog was falling out of the dog! 😥,0
2543,"Place was busy but food came out quick. Delicious hotdogs, make sure you get everything on it.",1
2544,"Definitely a ""to each his own"" experience.

I did not like the classic hotdog at all and my ""black and white"" milkshake was not good.  They do B&W with chocolate syrup.  Gross.

My family generally liked what they got.  This is NOT the east coast.  So don't expect the food to be what you think it is.  Good enough, if noisy, atmosphere.

They have a nice picture of pre-Trump Tower Chicago upstairs...",1
2545,Recommended by locals.  Not disappointed.  Great Chicago dog and Italian Steak sub.,1
2546,"Probably the worst customer service experience I've had. I've visited this location many times throughout the years and it has most certainly gone downhill. I love Portillos and this particular location is iconic tourist destination. Very embarrassed of this location.

Cashier behind the cash register waved me down after chatting with coworkers for 8 minutes and said ""come on"". She stared at me in complete silence until I asked her if she was ready. I gave her my order and she kept replying ""that's it?"". Btw I ordered Penne Diavolo with chicken with a lemonade. I waited at the counter for number to be called for over 15min. Guy finally saw me waiting and asked what was my order. I received my order with no chicken and was told to go to other end to receive lemonade if I wanted ice.... I also noticed 3 Uber eats drivers waited for their deliveries and completely ignored. They were finally assisted and food was just sitting there behind counter their entire wait.

Skip this Portillos at all cost. Food is great, staff is the issue here.",0
2547,"Crowded but delicious! They are packed for a reason, food does not disappoint. They could do more in organizing order pickup, 3 places to order and one place to pickup is calling for chaos. Would recommend the Chicago Dog if new to the city.",1
2548,"The food was on point as expected, they also had some keto friendly options surprisingly.",1
2549,"A place of Childhood memories. I live in Texas now n anytime I return to the wind of cities I make sure i drift towards this place. It's glorifies bar food or if u can recall the first restaurant u thought was amazing n then u grew up n found this. This is that , however it's just that. Trust me they incorporate all of Chicago's culinary staples...GO!!",1
2550,This is a classic Chicago joint but at the same time it’s aggressively average. If you like hot dogs it’s worth a visit but otherwise there are plenty of better places to visit in the city.,1
2551,Went here on the recommendation of colleague's while visiting Chicago.  It was every bit as good as advertised.  I'd hop on a flight from Dallas just to have some more for the weekend.,1
2552,"Love the hot dogs here. However, I will probably go to a different location next time I'm in Chicago.  This location is extremely busy and the dining room can get crowded. The staff is friendly and efficient, but it's just too crowded for my taste.",1
2553,I love Portillo's hot dogs.,1
2554,I love Portillos.  It is a must for a meal when I'm in Chicago.  The Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers and melted cheese is delicious.  Can be slow at times.,1
2555,Nice place to try a local favorite - Chicago dog was actually good. Love the crinkly fries and the onion rings were okay too. My sister loved that she could get an IPA beer 🍺,1
2556,"On my first visit to Chicago everyone said eat at Portillo’s. I pace my order at 6:15. It is now 8:26 and I still have not received my food!!! We have tried to call the restaurant and the driver and no one will answer the phone.  NEVER AGAIN WORST CUSTOMER
SERVICE AND SERVICE PERIOD!!!",0
2557,"I visited Chicago for a few days and one of my native friends recommended I try it before going.
I fell in love within the first bite, I got a Italian beef sandwich with fries and a tamale. Next time I visit definitely will be visiting again to try something new!",1
2558,"They have Chicago style hotdogs, Italian beef sandwiches, pasta & the best chocolate cake.",1
2559,Got the signature dog and it was full of flavor! Definitely understand why the locals love this place!,1
2560,"A Chicago favorite. The Polish dog is our favorite, but they have just about everything fast food. I plan to try the spicy chicken sandwich next. It can be a long wait because of the huge crowd.",1
2561,A must stop when visiting Chicago. Quick service. Yummy food.,1
2562,"The host was amazing!!! He made sure we knew how everything worked and the dogs were delicious. I don't really like hot dogs but, they were yummy! Definitely a place to grab a great dog while in the windy city.",1
2563,I ordered a cheeseburger and I'm not sure what in Gods name this is! I am pregnant and would like to speak to someone immediately about this issue!,0
2564,I got the chili cheese hotdog and it was good. My son got a cheeseburger and he said it was the best he ever had. The place was incredibly packed so I ordered my food online. Service was almost nonexistent so I had to wait forever just to get help and they messed up my order so I had to wait to inform them and then even longer to get it fixed.,1
2565,"It was nearly ten years before I finally gave this place a try. Now I'm addicted!! I've learned that every restaurant with long looonng lines, is worth the wait. I get the fish sandwich and cheese fries. The chocolate cake is delicious too. It all tastes perfect. I totally understand why people love love love the American tradition of burger and fries.",1
2566,"I walked up 3 blocks from the escape room with my 73 year old mom. We placed our order and sat down to wait.. our food came quickly but one of the sandwiches was wrong. I went back to the front counter as I approached a older manager walked up and asked was I ok after explaining what happened he simply said  "" no problem let me fix that"" he personally made my sandwich and gave it to me. I was shocked at how he handled me. I felt like it was important to make me leave as a satisfied customer... great job!!!",1
2567,"A fun place with hearty food, and good portions. The layout, is unique with several counters serving different types of food. Seating is on the main floor, a second level, and multiple adjoining rooms.",1
2568,"Quick service, tasty hot dogs, cool Chicago memorabilia. Exactly what you look for in a place like this. Also, had a great adult beverage selection.",1
2569,"A Chicago classic. Good hot dogs, shakes, crispy fries, and the good cheese.

There may be places that do any single of their offerings better, but Portillo’s has a consistent quality, a big menu, and fun atmosphere.

My wife and I ended up coming back twice in one weekend because we had such a good experience.

Now that they expanded into Minnesota, our children love Portillo’s, too.",1
2570,"Not gonna lie, I was super hype for the chocolate cake shake and I was really disappointed. It really tasted like a regular chocolate shake. I had a much better milkshake from a little vegan place later that day. HOWEVER, the inside of the restaurant is super cool and worth the visit just to see the atmosphere.",1
2571,"It took 20 minutes to get 2 soft drinks and cake. While the cake was super yummy they didn't have to cook it, it's there in the fridge, so I don't understand why it took so long to get drinks and a piece of cake. Other people in group had full meals that also took 25-30 minutes to get, there food was good but the fries were under salted and a little cold. It also seemed like they were half filled. The sandwiches, beef and cheddar croissants, were the best part of the meal. As someone who grew up with Portillos, moved away and came back, I'm actually pretty disappointed with it overall. It's not what it used to be but it's enough to get it once and reminisce. I wouldn't come back to this location but I'd try another location and see if it's better or not. If this is what it's like everywhere, I just won't come back to Portillos anymore. I still think you should try it once because it's so much apart of the Chicago experience, but as far as an every week or even once a month thing, not anymore.",1
2572,"Had the char broil chicken sandwich. It'll be such an understatement if I try to explain how bland the sandwich was if you've never tried it yourself. The cake shake was the main reason I wanted to try them out and even that was OVERLY sugary and wasn't blended enough. If you'd like to wait fot 40 minutes as I did for a chicken sandwich and a shake, this place is for you.",0
2573,"Nice ambience, good drinks as always in Hard Rock, very helpful staff.
Definitely would go back.",1
2574,Fun atmosphere for families. Food was yummy and we left full!,1
2575,If you take the classic hot-dog is good but the chili one is bland,1
2576,"Came here twice so we could try out more of the menu since there are so many options. My suggestion: Chicago hot dogs, fries (hot and crispy), and strangely enough the chicken tenders. The chicken tenders were randomly so juicy and crispy!

We also tried the Italian beef sandwich, sausage sandwich, onion rings, and chocolate cake milkshake. These felt average to me personally but overall, Portillos is great for tourists looking for a good, cheap meal!",1
2577,Great chicago dogs and beef sandwiches.  A little slow on the order fulfillment,1
2578,"On 7-16-2021, I ordered online at 7pm. I was informed after paying for my order it would be ready at 7:30pm. I walked over to retrieve my order. It had to be prepared. I did not know it was prepared AFTER I arrived. Misinformation. I waited OVER 30 minutes to get my order.
When our name was called, the order was wrong!!! I asked for hot peppers on my beef, got sweet peppers, I'm allergic. No hamburger, no fries; was given my bag twice BY STAFF without the full order. The fries we were given were horrible. They appeared in our bag like the fries you cook when you're at the bottom of the frozen bag.

I was in the store the day before and ordered at the counter. This encounter WAS WONDERFUL. I will NEVER order online again and I'm thoroughly frustrated with this store and this experience. Please improve your online process. We were not the only people who experiences inadequate service.",0
2579,The cake shake here is one of the best milkshakes you’ll have. They blend a slice of chocolate cake into your chocolate shake so when you suck through the straw you get small pieces of cake too. This might not sound nice but it is actually class. The texture and burst of sweetness of these cake pieces adds to the milkshake and when you get to the end you can scoop the remainder of the cake from the bottom of the cup,1
2580,"Hot-dog purists might bemoan the lack of true Chicago wieners available in the downtown area, but this outpost of the local Portillo's chain - gussied up with a nearly corny 1930s gangster theme - is the place to get one. Try one of its famous dogs and a slice of the heavenly chocolate cake.",1
2581,"Portillo's is fantastic. There's nowhere better to get a taste of the Chicago classics. The hot dogs and the beef might not be the absolute best in the city, but they're very consistent and they're consistently good. Anytime we have visitors from out of town, Portillo's is one of our first stops.",1
2582,"Waited over 20 minutes for a small chocolate cake shake. They served dozens of food orders before us while we just stood there like chums with no idea how much longer we’d have to wait. Good night be good, but don’t go for a shake unless you have the afternoon off!",0
2583,A must try location of Portillo's if in Chicago. The chocolate cake milkshake is worth the hype.,1
2584,When you go to Chicago this is a must. The food is not only good but the environment is one of a kind. Every time I have been it's a treat.,1
2585,Waited 30 minutes for a hot dog and a side while others waited for 10 minutes max,0
2586,Very slow service but the food so good it doesn't matter. Had a Chicago style char dog ..yummy,1
2587,"Great place,  the staff were polite and even checked up on us to see if we needed anything else while we were at table eating .",1
2588,They move fast so don't be timid of the long lines. Food always hot.,1
2589,Cheap Chicago hotdog. Restaurant has lots of space and seats.,1
2590,Every time I’m in Chicago I have to stop here and get a authentic Chicago style hot dog. It just tastes better in the actual city. Great service and great food!,1
2591,Must eat when visiting Chicago! Try the hotdog and a beef sandwich,1
2592,Best hotdogs ever!! Order the Polish dog!!! Beef sandwich is good too! Love love love and so cheap!!,1
2593,I aked for no mayo on my sandwich and order was fixed with no question by manager. I waited literly 15min for the rest of my order.,1
2594,"Staff is friendly, and entertaining. Ordered a Chicago style dog, and was not overwhelmed, or underwhelmed, I was just whelmed. Like every Chicago style dog I've had. The fries were perfect, though, and so was the wonderful woman who greeted us at the door. I'd go back for those two, alone",1
2595,"Had my first ever Chicago style dog here. I enjoyed it! I wish the hot dog was grilled as that's my preference but there is so much toppings it mask the boiled dog taste.

Also go the cake shake which was delicious but poorly blended. Most of the cake was on the bottom of the cup. Shake itself was also too thick for my preference.",1
2596,"Best portillos in the area in terms of food and quality
Worst portillos in the area in terms of speed/service, no one will man the registers here for 5-10 minutes at a time",0
2597,DELICIOUS!! A must try if you're in Chicago!,1
2598,Long lines yet I didn’t have to wait long to order or get my food. There weren’t much tables available on the floor level and they had the second floor closed off. Not sure why they would do this during lunchtime. Luckily the food was good enough to give you 5 stars.,1
2599,Chicago dog - a must try when visiting. Locals love it here,1
2600,Great price. Juicy hot dogs!,1
2601,Chili Cheese Dog MmmmMmmmm😋,1
2602,"Braved the Chicago child for this one.  All I can say is that it was well worth it. Inside,  you get the vibe that you were thrown back into the 70s. Staff seem robotic but it is probably because they always have a rush of people so it takes away from the friendliness",1
2603,"Great place, great food!  Sons favorite is the chocolate cake!  We always bring our out of town guests before they leave Chicago! Our favorites are the jumbo hotdog, chili cheese dog, maxwell, fries, and the fish sandwich!  Oh and a must is the chocolate malt with extra malt, yummy.",1
2604,"Had a terrible experience here. Ordered food and after about 5 minutes saw it sitting behind the counter. 15 more minutes passed and it just sat there. I inquired about it and the attendant  said “we’re waiting on your diet coke” then continued on with other orders. After 5 more minutes of my food sitting there, I asked again if I could just have my food. Low and behold my drinks had also been sitting on the counter ready to go. She didn’t apologize for the delay. The 20 plus people behind me on line has already received there food at this point. As expected our food was cold. It was not a pleasant experience at all",0
2605,The beef sandwich and the Chicago dog were as good as advertised.,1
2606,Had the Italian beef with cheese sauce and it was delicious. Will definitely be back.,1
2607,Garden dog run to get it. My meat eater friends love it,1
2608,"If you only order a hot dog, the staff will be on their game. Ask for the over-hyped chicken sandwich and watch the kitchen staff unravel. With no large crowd at 9:30 pm on 6/7, our order of three hot dogs and two chicken sandwiches took 30 minutes to fill. Even though the chicken was late, at least our hot dogs had a chance to get cold and soggy before they were eaten. If you are up for a quality Chicago dog with punctual service, the Costco on S Ashland Avenue won’t disappoint.",0
2609,"Always good, fresh and quick. Love this place!",1
2610,"The food is good and affordably priced, not to mention a local Chicago icon! Its popularity comes with the cost of long lines so we had to wait a long time for our orders, but overall I was very happy with my Jumbo Dog and Chocolate Cake Shake",1
2611,That Italian Beef with the hot peppers and extra gravy will haunt my dreams until next time.,1
2612,One of the most iconic restaurants that is a must to visit offering the Chicago signature Italian beef and hot dogs. Although the menu options are vast you can't miss this opportunity to try out such delicious food,1
2613,"This was always my Dad's favorite.
Great sausages and Italian Beef.",1
2614,"Hot dog was just OK. My friend got the chicken sandwich and fries and it took 35 minutes to get it. I feel awful for the employees because they’re doing the best they can but waiting over an half hour for food to go is overkill. They could offer something like a drink or snack for free if they’re going to make us stand around for food.

Also it ended up being a terrible sandwich and “just ok” fries.",0
2615,"Omg. Run to this place. Had the combo ( beef and sausage) and also a chicago dog because, we were on Chicago. My kids loved the French fries as they were so crispy salty and soft inside .",1
2616,A Classic to do .!!,1
2617,"Overrated, dont belive the hype. Would have been 1 star but the chicago dog was alright. The Italian beef was disgusting, overcooked beef with zero flavor. My order was cold and was missing an item. Been trying to reach them over the phone to at least get my money back for the missing item but they don't answer. Don't waste your time or money here.",0
2618,"When I went to pick up my order that I had put 20 minutes before, they had me waiting for 10 minutes while workers were looking at me and not saying anything. By the time they came and talked to me, they clicked something on the computer and walked away. When they had my foot ready, they threw it on the desk and walked away. There were two other people having the same issue and one of them decided to cancel their order.  First time in Chicago and I'm not sure I would recommend this place.",0
2619,Amazing hot dogs! Beautiful and clean place. Must try!,1
2620,Fancy place to have hotdogs. Don't miss going to this place when visiting Chicago.,1
2621,Italian beef is ridiculously good. Get the hot peppers,1
2622,"Loved the ambience, it is crowded all the time but you get seats easily. Their hot dogs are Italian sandwich was the best. If you are not a health freak you need to try the chocolate cake milk shake. Overall we had a memorable food during our visit in Chicago. After visiting many restaurants during the restaurant week, this places price was a bummer loved it",1
2623,"Great traditional Chicago hot dogs
Good and interesting beers.
Continual very loud announcements of when orders being ready were a nuisance. Maybe replace this with a visual silent display.",1
2624,One of the best hot dogs in Chicago...bit be patient...the lines are long.,1
2625,Didn't expect what I saw/experience.  The cafeteria style with the disorganization of ordering and picking up your food threw me off. But........the food was worth it all.,1
2626,"Ordered it online. The delivery was super late as it seems the restaurant is very busy. But it was worth the wait.

Great Hotdogs and Sandwiches. Their signature dish is their Chocolate Cake or the Chocolate Cake Shake which many people don’t know about. Do their their shake. You can also get a beer, appetizers and a lots of sandwich options to choose from.",1
2627,"Glad I tried it! Even at 9pm they had a 30 minute or longer line, that was still there when I left closer to 10pm. I tried the Chicago style hot dog. Glad I tried it, but probably won't get it again. Open, loud environment, everyone seemed to be having a good time. Finding a table (especially for large party) is difficult.",1
2628,"This was the low point of our visit to the Windy City. This place is a chaotic mess of gaudy Chicago stereotypes, half-considered food, and DIY service. The vibe is intense, but not for us.",0
2629,"I ask for onion rings and they forgot about it, so I'm sorry but I'm giving this 1-star review.",0
2630,Authentic Chicago Food!! Chicago dog was awesome and the beef sandwich was great!!,1
2631,Yummy so we got two hotdogs per person for breakfast!,1
2632,"Really enjoy coming here! Great fries and hot dog. However, the hot chocolate I ordered was really bland.",1
2633,I ordered the Eclair Cake.  I had staple like medal and plastic in my cake.  Could not believe it.  Heard great things about the cake so I was super excited to try just to be disappointed....,0
2634,"Fantastic Location. The fries are out of this world. I love the Italian beef and peppers.Yummy food! Everything we tried was tasty, particularly the big beef (Italian beef)! Prices are fair, good sized portions.Great food to  order . The decorations are amazing and the feel of the place was great! Like Who doesn't love portillos? The Polish dog Chicago style is a must. Cheese fries are dreamy!!!!!. The chocolate cake shake is like no other you've ever tried.!!!!!",1
2635,"Good food. Decent service; missed a portion of our order, it took 2 requests to get the chicken sandwich missed.",1
2636,"Great food, great prices, great team members. They're a lot of fun and always ready to help you with your order. I hadn't been in for a while because of covid19 and really enjoyed my Italian sausage sandwich, cheese fries and the thick, thick chocolate shake. The double thick wasn't a mistake folks. It's really thick and chocolatey.  I usually get the Italian beef, dipped of course, there's really no other way to have it, but everything at portillos is good.",1
2637,"Terrible customer service, the staff was very rude! Decent food. You can find better Chicago hot dogs style on the street! For be a fast food restaurant the staff is very slow needs a better manager in this particular location.",0
2638,"God, I love this place! Their charbroiled chicken sandwich is my favorite grilled chicken sandwich ever. The chicken is so juicy and cooked perfectly! Plus, their French fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. I know most folks come for the hot dogs and beef sandwiches, but don't miss out on their chicken sandwiches!! So freaking good.",1
2639,Hotdogs rock 'natch! Burgers are damn good too! But their beef n cheddar croissants have immediately soared into my top 3 list of their best sammies!,1
2640,Pretty good sausages fries and onion rings at a cheap price. Only gripe about it was the seating. At 10 2 hours before they closed they had almost all but 6 tables forcing us to carry our food back to our hotel. Was Luke warm at best,1
2641,Nice place..1st timw tryn Chicago hot dog very diff but tasty,1
2642,best hotdog salad I’ve ever tasted.,1
2643,1st time in town and ate here and really enjoyed it.The entire staff was real friendly while being real busy with our group of 26 people. The manager was also so curious and checked on all of us several time. Keep up the great work.,1
2644,Food is delicious and the wait time was was very little,1
2645,Crazy lines and chaotic atmosphere. Decent Chicago hot dog but nothing special.,1
2646,I was very skeptical of the Chicago dog. Just like the atmosphere of this restaurant the Chicago dog comes together in one unique package and is a must not just for the hotdogs.,1
2647,Ok food cool atmosphere. Nice that it's open late!,1
2648,"I just love Portillo’s!

It will take long to get your food (They are a world famous spot)

It’s such a run down place (because it’s so old…and honestly when will they find time to renovate)

But you will love the food, the new spicy chicken sandwich is top tier (I get mine with grilled onions and no mayo)

**TRY THE CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!",1
2649,Suoerb Italian beef sandwich. Reasonably priced too !,1
2650,"Good Italian beefs and hot dogs and even salads and pasta are all here. The only issue was our meal was 19 dollars for both me and my Uncle Robert, and he was quite frustrated about it.",1
2651,FUN environment and def a must do for tourists but just average food. Kind of a mall food court situation.,1
2652,"A Chicago institution, even if they've recently been acquired. Quality still great (for now)",1
2653,The cashier and manager at 8.50pm 10/21/2021 was vera Rude they made a mistake on my order. They added an extra hamburger and before get the order I went to the cashier and when I tried to explain the cashier was very rude and didn’t let me explain she called the manager and was with the same bad attitude… the worst customer service! Nice place decent food but service really disappointed for be a place very recommended when you visit Chicago ! When I got my order they gave me only 6 hamburgers!!!!!,0
2654,"Life changing! Amazingly good, a can’t miss if you have the opportunity.",1
2655,Excellent hot dog and the coolest interior to a quick serve restaurant ever.,1
2656,Ordered 4 sandwiches.  We received 3.  Called held with phone ringing for 6 min 33 seconds.  They hung up automatically without answering.  Stolen 6+ dollars from us and they are probably feeling good about it.  Do not order online from this mess of a rest.,0
2657,In a pouring rain storm the staff was still super polite and efficient. Food was damn good and the famous fluffy chocolate cake shakes were to die for. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Chicago,1
2658,Food is always the Best. Will be going back again.,1
2659,"Took about an hour to receive my food.  I ordered one hot dog, small fries, and a drink.",1
2660,Can’t even rate the food because still waiting for it over an hour after walking in,0
2661,The interior of this location was beyond beautiful!!! We had the Jumbo Hotdog that came with chili and pickles,1
2662,The food is excellent and the service was very fast!,1
2663,The Tillo never misses. Is the food other than the Chicago Dog top tier? No. But it is certainly 4/5 stars worthy. The employees always make me smile and I do enjoy the classic Chicago atmosphere,1
2664,"Really good for the price, better than a normal hot dog",1
2665,"First time trying a Chicago Italian Beef. Nothing like a philly cheese steak! It's juicy and sloppy but the meat is much leaner. It also has a sweet-spicy taste with, yes, notable Italian flavor. Friendly staff and clean bathrooms too!",1
2666,Best dog I had while trying many here I chicago,1
2667,"Wonderful Italian Food, but make sure to ask for the toppings you want or don't want on your sandwich, sausage or other orders beforehand!",1
2668,"Wow I will rate it a 3 because my expectations were high because of the rave reviews of so many people from Chicago. The cashiers were not helpful and quiet. Basically whispering your total to you. Hot dog was the best part of the experience. Classic Chicago do really enjoyed. But not the best I had in the city. The famous part is the cake. which honestly let me down and I am a big chocolate cake fan. It's not like it was bad. Just didn't blow my mind like the stories lead me to believe.  Overall would return again for just casual eating, but wasn't anything to fancy.",1
2669,"I believe if you come to Chicago, this is a requirement to eat here at least once!  Food is great, speedy service, and so much history of famous folks on the walls who also enjoyed the iconic food stop.  Don't miss out!",1
2670,"Best Italian Beef ever, our favorite meal during our visit to Chicago was here. Great food and experience.",1
2671,"You can't go to Chicago and skip Portillos. If you love Hotdogs and the Italian beef sandwich you will be blown away. Great selection of burgers too.
The second story is closed due to covid, so seating is limited.",1
2672,My burger was cold. Cheese wasn't even melted. Also the girl passing out the orders stood there picking at her ear and hair then handing out the food! Gross,0
2673,"Awesome hotdogs, really good fries, great price, fast service",1
2674,"Gotta love a good Chicago Dog, and this place does it right! Great fries, decent beer selection, great location and ambiance.",1
2675,45 minute wait but hotdog was delicious,1
2676,"The place is big and definitely very crowded. Unfortunately the menu is too large for one place to order and another place to receive the order. We waited for over an hour to get our food apparently it was set aside and the hot dog was extremely soggy besides the fact that it was really small..
For the number of people that are coming in to order, it needs to be more organized",0
2677,"It was my first time at this location. I got small fry and onion rings no salt and the Whitefish sandwich on brioche bun, no cheese, easy on the tar tar sauce. Every item was piping hot and all staff was wonderful, per usual. Right off the expressway so the ride home was super quick.",1
2678,Great hot dogs and food. Highly recommend it!,1
2679,"Italian Beef, Double sweet peppers, Drenched in Gravy! MMmmmmmm.",1
2680,Had to try the famous hot dog. Maybe it's just me but it tasted nothing but preservatives and artificial flavors.,0
2681,"Had a wonderful experience at Portillo's.  I went with my brother and we enjoyed two hot dogs each.  I chose to go with two classic Chicago Dogs.  He chose a Chicago Dog and a Chili Dog.  I thoroughly enjoyed mine as did my brother.  The lines were long when we arrived, but moved extremely quickly.  A great feature here is the massive selection available.  You can almost literally order any kind of American food here that you could think of.  It was a great stop for an inexpensive meal in Chicago that left a mark.  This stop was a unique visit that gave a great view of some Chicago food and culture without requiring a reservation or large check.  Next time I'm in or even passing through Chicago, I hope to be able to stop back.",1
2682,"Portillo's has the best Italian Beef in Chicago combined with the most unsettling decor. Going inside feels like you've been transported back a couple centuries into a Western-themed, saloon-esque Macy's department store and the mannequins are all dressed for the occasion. This is worthy of five stars because you can't find this anywhere else. Great beef.",1
2683,It’s a Chicago staple. Check it out on your trip. Give yourself plenty of time to make it thought the line. So much to choose from.,1
2684,"Occupancy at limited capacity. Staff with masks. Chocolate cake, hotdog and beef sandwich ok; unfortunately, there was no lemon cake. Enjoyed the crinkly fries. The bell pepper was on the salty side. Chocolate milkshake was thick and delicious, reminiscent of in 'n out milkshake. Service was quick and friendly. I would eat there again.",1
2685,I've been craving a Chicago style hotdog for years! This hit the spot.,1
2686,Nice ambiance. Good selection of dogs. Fast service.,1
2687,"A great choice for typical Chicago fare. The hot dogs are top tier, along with the Italian beef. Pretty good fries and decadent cake shake as well. I would love to have more things from their menu, but every time I walk up to the register I end up ordering 2 dogs with everything.

Went to this location around noon on a Friday, and it took about 10 minutes to get our food (remember, ordering is just a small part of the wait). Not too bad honestly. We had a table for 4 right away, which had just been cleaned. Great experience.",1
2688,Great food and very affordable.  Had a good time.,1
2689,Must go to if you are in the Chicago area. Just be prepared to wait for your food for a little bit but it is worth the wait. The staff is very busy and may not seem the friendliest but if you pass them a quick compliment or a “thank you” they are very nice and helpful.,1
2690,It's hot in there and was less than we expected with the food.,1
2691,When you order your hot dog you got to say drag it through the garden that mean for them to put everything on it,1
2692,"It can be a little overwhelming when you walk in and their are several different counters with food. The process is fairly easy, just remember to grab your food from the counter with the correct type, as in pasta at the pasta counter. The beer is cheap as well, their isn't too much seating and it can get super busy, so remember that.",1
2693,You have to go when visiting Chicago. The inside decor is great. Fast food and even if they are busy it goes by quick. Had the yummy chicago dog and chocolate cake!,1
2694,I ordered the Maxwell Street Polish my friend ordered Fettucine Alfredo and a Spicy Chicken Sandwich. We both enjoyed our food. I do not know where Maxwell Street is located and why the street is Polish but I do know that us one darn good hotdog.,1
2695,Just had the chocolate cake shake but it was so good.,1
2696,"I know this is a Chicago favorite, but on my visit to Chicago I tried it and it was okay. I found it to not have much flavor and it was really greasy.",1
2697,"There are a lot of options. Be prepared with your order though, the cashiers move fast",1
2698,Awesome food. Always great.  Not a fan of the cake shake,1
2699,Great Chicago-style hotdogs and beef sandwiches!,1
2700,"It was really busy, but the food came out pretty quick. Delicious hot dogs!",1
2701,"Great meal. skip the cheese, tiny amount. get the spicy peppers on Italian Beef!",1
2702,It is ok. Good experience and food is fine but not great,1
2703,Staff is beyond rude. You're better off getting a hot dog off the street,0
2704,Just make sure you book a hotel while you wait for your hot dog! So sloooooow!,1
2705,This time I tried the burgers and was delicious,1
2706,The food was delicious.  Fun and clean atmosphere and very friendly staff!,1
2707,"This is one of the coolest places I've ever been. My girlfriend and I came here while in Chicago and we're astounded at how good a Chicago dog can be. We also tried the Italian beef, which in my opinion was one of the best sandwiches I've eaten for the price.",1
2708,The so call best hot dogs in Chicago actually stood by that. Fast service and the best hot dogs I've ever had I recommend the Maxwell,1
2709,Wishing I would have tried the chocolate cake.,1
2710,Had their Cake Shake! It was  pretty good! Look for arrows near BP to get in!,1
2711,"A Chicago must-eat. Hot Dogs are good, but the Italian Beef is even better.",1
2712,"This place use to be the bomb digiddy after they sold I feel like they've kinda lost their touch their food isn't as good as it used to be,  I don't know maybe it's just me....",1
2713,Good selection of food and drinks. Busy but food was  quick. I would definitely go back again.,1
2714,"Very tasty. Long wait, but felt like it was a great Chicago experience.",1
2715,Amazing italian beef sandwich and hot dog!,1
2716,Great hot dog and onion rings.,1
2717,"Ah that effin Milkshake. It killed me. It's a once in a lifetime thing for me. I loved it but no I will not have it again. I love the hotdog. It packed my kind of flavour - nothing subtle, right smack in the face flavour. I placed the order a little late in the evening, but the servers were prompt and friendly.  Do have the cake milkshake if you have not ever tried it. It's one off my bucket list",1
2718,Great atmosphere and wonderful hotdogs!,1
2719,"A single employee is the reason this location is recieving a higher rating than they deserve. Order issues: WRONG 3X, severely over charged 2X, longer than usual wait time. A nice young lady who witnessed me several times standing in line took the initiative to try multiple times to correct my issues to no avail. Finally she had to personally take my order, refund me my correct change, make my order and serve it to me. WoW! She's the Michael Jordan of this location. For her alone I'm willing to give them another try, besides the food is good. A bit pricey.",1
2720,"Very authentic flavors and friendly service. Unfortunately because of covid protocols, there is no dining in.... Only pickup to go is available at the moment.",1
2721,Combination Italian beef and sausage: the drive thru makes it quick and convenient.,1
2722,"Used to be fantastic, but ever since the new owners bought it, it’s been going downhill. The quality of the food and service has gone down, somehow the lines have gotten worse. They used to have really great food, not it’s just kinda eh. Really disappointed, used to be some of the best fast food, now it’s on par with Burger King.",0
2723,"Love me some Portillo's!  Great burgers, dogs, and more!",1
2724,"Average spicy chicken sandwich with added bacon and cheese. Better quality than McDonald’s, but nothing special. Fries warm rather than hot.",1
2725,Not the best experience. Literally employees are having conversations and doing work,0
2726,"The food is good, there's a lot of variety, and it's just a fun place to go. They had enough employees to take orders fairly quickly. I will warn you, though-  there are two pickup counters. Know which food to pick up where or you might be standing by the wrong counter.",1
2727,You will most likely be in the drive thru  waiting for your food for 45 min to an hour.,0
2728,Fantastic Italian Beef sandwich and amazing hotdogs.,1
2729,"My wife and I each had a Portillo dog and fries. My mom had a salad. We ordered the chocolate cake, but we didn't notice it wasn't in the bag until we were on the way out of the city. We live about an hour and a half away, so it wasn't worth turning around. The hot dogs were okay. It was our first Chicago style hot dog as we just moved out here recently. The fries were subpar. The salad was actually my favorite thing. I still want to try the cake, so I might try coming again someday, but definitely not high on my list to try again.",1
2730,Good first time experience the service was good cashier was kind and respectful place was clean and had hand sanitizer,1
2731,The hotdog and fries are pretty good but the Italian beef and chocolate cake were average. I had higher expectations for the cake considering how it was promoted on food network. Pretty pricey but I won’t mark them down for that since it’s in a busy area.,1
2732,Awesome food . I get the combo dipped and cheese sauce on the side with golden crisp and fries and a sodee poppz.,1
2733,"Ordered by Uber eats. 4 dogs with everything ordered, 2 dogs ketchup only show up. Got the salad and fries but no hot peppers and 2 dogs missing. Called to speak with someone. Phone just rings. Still hungry and major disappointed.",0
2734,"Pretty well known chain restaurant in Chicago. I've eaten here before, just not at this location. The food is good for what it is. I liked the loaded up hotdogs. The beef sandwich is also very good, make sure you get it dipped. They have pretty large portion sizes. The only thing I don't like about this place is how long it takes to get food. If you come here at a remotely busy time, you'll wait at least 30 minutes before you're sitting down to eat.",1
2735,"Soooo big! The inside of this place was like a mall food court. It was confusing where to order. We were told we could order everything in one spot by a guy in line who ordered there several times before, we had to go to a separate line for drinks and dessert. We also had to pick up food in 2 different locations. Seems to me there is a way better way to organize ordering and pick up.",1
2736,Best hot dogs I've ever had!,1
2737,"Really good food, nice place, so busy.",1
2738,"They really need to put a bench, I can't be standing 30min for my chocolate cake milk shake",1
2739,"Super popular classic Chicago diner. The beef-sandwich, and the chocolate cake is also recommended. For real enthusiasts!",1
2740,"Good local hot dog place. I tried the hot beef with extra gravy and it was very good. The onion rings were a little overdone but the fries with cheese sauce were perfect. We also got the Portillos hot dog and cheeseburger. All in all the hot dog was probably the best dish.

The interior is nice and seems like a throwback to the classic diner era. The music and decor reminds me of the 50s or 60s. If you’re in the area give it a chance, you won’t be disappointed.",1
2741,"Great place for a good hot dog. This place was very busy, but worth the wait. One of my favorite places to stop in when visiting Chicago. Food was delicious and the atmosphere is always inviting for families. Getting a table was a little bit of a challenge, but it’s expected when you visit a popular food destination. Highly recommended.",1
2742,The dog and the polish sausage were really good,1
2743,"It's an expensive hot dog at a fast food place that's super busy.

30 bucks for 4 hot dogs a fry and 2 small drinks.

If that price seems okay to you then you won't be disappointed.",1
2744,"The Portillo's hot dog tasted great, but it took more than half an hour to get our food.",1
2745,Great place to just hang out with friends.,1
2746,"Hot dogs were great. Pro Tip: order online and pick up at the counter, it's seat yourself so you can find a table for your group afterwards and not have to wait in the super long line.",1
2747,Love the hot dogs and Italian beef. It gets pretty crowded tho.,1
2748,Yummy Chicago style dogs. But it takes forever to pick up your order.,1
2749,I was suggested this restaurant by true Chicago residence. I tried the restaurant twice two different types of dishes and was very surprised on how delicious they were. I tried the bacon cheeseburger and the Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers. Both meals were outstanding and I enjoyed the fries with your cheese sauce to top it off. Staff was very friendly and welcoming.,1
2750,Good hot dogs and milkshakes. Friendly relaxed atmosphere,1
2751,A must try for the ultimate Chicago foodie experience,1
2752,"This was on my bucket list while I was in Chicago.  I ordered two hot dogs, one with everything (I was nervous) and one with just ketchup, mustard and onions.  Try the hot dog with everything! It was excellent!  I wish I had ordered both of them that way.  I am also quite impressed with the work ethic of the workers.  Great food at a great price!",1
2753,"Amazing and a special Chicago treats for the world to enjoy and appreciate. They offer many amazing items and treats from all over but not to forget the dogs, burgers and Italian beef. It's worth the trip and then some. Love the vibe and the culture here that welcomes everyone. Again, you will enjoy this experience and the dog's shakes and drinks are sweet and creative",1
2754,"Hot dogs were great, but the cake shake that I got wasn't blended properly. Top half was all ice cream and bottom half of the cup was a whole cake that we can't use a straw to enjoy it.",1
2755,This place had a great atmosphere and awesome decor. The place looked busy as hell and was not the wait was not bad at all. The chili dog and regular dog were delicious and you could taste the quality beef. For a meal for four we waited about 20 minutes but that was just after noon. The drinks are pretty good and not too expensive. Seating can be limited but at times they seem to open up the second floor. Would highly recommend.,1
2756,It was ok but I'm a New York  hot dog person .,1
2757,"Crowded place with many food options, the place is pretty big and clean, but expect to wait a good 10 min.i recommend the Chicago style hot dogs.",1
2758,"This is the place that, if you haven't tried it yet, your friends will make it a priority to take you there. Known for their legendary Italian Beef sandwich (get it extra dipped) and the classic Chicago Hotdog (as well as top notch salads and ribs), Portillo's is a Chicago staple that is sure to please time and time again. Great food, efficient service, and a true taste of Chicago history.",1
2759,"If you can find a table during rush, you're in luck. Charming and perfect 'authentic' Chicago style dogs and as an added bonus, the shakes are amazing.",1
2760,"Decent hot dog, efficient service and huge seating area",1
2761,It's taste of Chicago. Especially can drink beer from Chicago. Awesome!!!,1
2762,Food is good but the employees are not helpful and very rude,0
2763,Gotta go with the vegan dog. Get three for the price of a ramen diner somewhere else.,1
2764,Love this place and the food but for some reason this location forgets to put straws 90% of the time. Still worth it for a burger and cake shake tho!!,1
2765,Delicious Italian beef sandwiches and hot dogs. Comfortable and fun atmosphere.,1
2766,"Food was average, but staff are down right rude. Kept getting orders wrong.  Took forever to get the Itailian beef, but my pasta came up quick so that it was cold by the time all the food got to us. The whole place was disorganized.   My daughter did think the Itailian Beef was good. My pasta and salad were just ok. Bad experience for average food. And the women's rest room was filthy.",0
2767,Just absolutely loved my meal!  Made up something different - a hot Italian sausage with pickles and sport peppers like the traditional Chicago dog. Absolutely delicious!,1
2768,Most decent hotdogs I have ever eaten.,1
2769,I have been going there for year the food is just  on point delicious .,1
2770,"Portillo’s Hot Dogs have always been a go to for the best hot dogs and burgers. As soon as you walk in it’s like you time travel, with all the neon lighting and old fashioned booths. The staff is always friendly and smiling, they honestly seem happy at their job plus the service is very speedy. The chocolate cakes are known to be the best around and my personal favorite the strawberry milkshake; perfect with any meal. The drive through is always at least 5 cars but still moves at a good pace, the lines here at any time of day speak for themselves. This place is the place to visit if your in town. Wish I was able to give 6 stars! The management here is phenomenal!",1
2771,"It was very good. The wait was extensive but I thought it was worth it. The prices were high for basically street vendor style food. It was extremely busy and many of the tables weren’t clean. The staff was rude and got offended when we attempted to clean our own table; there was nowhere else to sit while we were waiting. We watched them just stand around not doing anything. There was grease all over the chairs and mustard on the table tree.

The polish was very good and had a nice flavor. The fries were lukewarm. I had the Italian beef sandwich which would have been excellent if it was at the right temperature. The staff stopped using the loud speaker to call out numbers for unknown reasons. The wait time was outrageous. I would have ordered more food because the sandwich left me hungry but didn’t feel like waiting 15-20 minutes for another cold item.",1
2772,There were lots of choices for food not just hot dogs. I got a chicken sandwich and my husband got an Italian beef sandwich. Both were delicious and nicely portioned.  Service was friendly and efficient.,1
2773,"I took my friend for the first time and assured her that although the line looks like, it goes fast! Although it was crowded, we did find a table upstairs.
I ordered a chili cheese dog, cheese fries and chocolate cake shake and she ordered a spicy chicken sandwich, cheese fries and strawberry shortcake. My meal didn't disappoint, as usual. My friend also really loved her meal and I tried the strawberry shortcake for the first time - very yummy. Portillo's is always a must for Chicago visitors as well as locals",1
2774,Always love getting a meal here when visiting Chicago. Food is always good and service is fast.,1
2775,Chicago dog was flavorful and the banana peppers gave it the perfect amount of kick. Italian Beef was nicely seasoned. I can see why they say the chocolate cake is world famous,1
2776,This place was great with the decor and menu choices. I went with another person and there was some confusion where I went to the only pick-up window but hers was ready for pick-up where she ordered. I had my first Chicago dog here and the flavors exceeded my expectations. I only wish the bun was toasted or a more sturdy type since it got soft quickly. I would love to come back and try other items but still get that tasty cake shake!,1
2777,"Really good, fast and cheap hot dogs! Definitely want to swing by if you are visiting.",1
2778,"This location was great for a late night drive up snack/meal. We got pasta with extra sauce,, cheese Fries , a chocolate cake shake and strawberry shortcakes!  All for 31.00. a great deal. The wait time was very reasonable as well.",1
2779,"Delicious! The food is great, the serving sizes on the drinks are huge, and the food finishes cooking in roughly 5 minutes. But beware the lunch rush! It gets very busy VERY QUICKLY.",1
2780,absolute staple. try the cake shake without the extra syrup if it’s too rich!,1
2781,"Very good italian beef and wonderful milkshakes.  They forgot our bottled pop but one we pointed it out, they were very quick and polite about it.  Wonderful service and we could order ahead and just drive through to pick it up.",1
2782,This place used to be great but the quality of not only the food but the service is unacceptable. Just purchased a cheeseburger and while eating it I pulled out not 1 but 2 long hairs. This is disgusting and I will no longer be visiting this establishment.,0
2783,"Definitely not what I'm used to, but it was pretty good. I got the beef hot dog and I'd definitely order it again.",1
2784,"Absolute staple in Chicago, serving up dogs, sandwiches, and the Italian beef. Line can be a bit long but completely worth it. They have a pretty good amount of options, but not reason to get to tricky with this, get an Italian beef and don't look back, you will not regret it. Chose toppings of sweet or hot peppers, type of cheese, and a long roll or croissant, then enjoy. Have not had the chance to do every single place around the city, but this was absolutely Delicious. Would come back without a doubt, especially since I did not get a chance to have the chocolate cake shake, which is highly regarded. If you are looking for some classic Chicago Italian beef, stop in.",1
2785,"Always fun to go to for the experience. Even though I don't eat hot dogs, I still love it. Enjoyed the surprisingly high-quality grilled tuna sandwich and spaghetti—as well as the infamous decadent cake shake. Portions are huge, and somehow there's always seating, despite how busy the place gets.",1
2786,"The Chicago dog here is hands down the best I’ve ever had from the fresh tomatoes and pickles and pepper and size of the dog itself. We also ordered hamburgers and onion rings for the kids the onion rings were very good, and if you order the Italian beef you won’t be disappointed either. The Italian beef meat was so juicy and good loved it more than the most popular spot people go to.",1
2787,It can be confusing for a visitor to understand the flow of this very busy restaurant. It doesn't matter which line you pick you will still be ordering off the same menu for the same restaurant. I love that it is open late and gets food out quickly enough.,1
2788,"Went here after Lollapalooza around 11pm and waited in a 10 car drive thru line for 1 and a half hours. At the window they told us they gave our food away and wouldn’t/couldn’t remake it. They gave us a couple pieces of cake and our drinks and luckily refunded our order. However when the manager Tom came up to tell us that there was “no food left for us” and he would treat “us and 10 friends to a full lunch”. He gave us a nonexistent email and when we tried to call back our call was picked up and left on the counter for over 30 minutes, When we tried to return the next day to take Tom up on his offer they told us to place and order before 11pm, which we tried to do and were again disconnected after waiting a very long time.",0
2789,The security guard at the front was really rude. Wouldn't let me wait with my dog outside since the food was taking forever and they were closing up. He insisted that if I go outside then I can't come back in. I get that's their policy but this isn't exactly the US congress. It's a hot dog shop. You can open the door so that my dog isn't sitting all alone for 20 minutes at night in chicago.,0
2790,"Food is good, sat in drive thru for 45 mins.",0
2791,Found by accident. Lots of food choices and nice surroundings. Hot dogs to burgers to spaghetti and food court prices.,1
2792,"Portillo's is SO good! I had my first Chicago dog here a few years back, and it did not disappoint. This time around I tried their big Italian beef sandwich, and it knocked my socks off! It was so flavorful and filling, and the location is fun. I am looking forward to my next visit!",1
2793,"Such a large variety of options, there's something for everyone here!",1
2794,Everyone on the planet should treat themselves to an Italian beef sandwich from Portillo's.  Get it dipped with gooey melted cheese!,1
2795,"This restaurant came recommended by our tour guide.  He said the Italian Beed sandwiches and the Chicago dogs were the best here.  I agree they were good, but wholly cow the ordering and pickup process were something to behold.  Once you order you are given an order number and told to move forward to a large group of people standing around waiting for someone to tell out your number.  It is complete chaos!  The food and atmosphere was good though.  Lots of memorabilia from the area.",1
2796,"Really good food, but pretty crowded at lunch. The cake shake is definitely a must for all first timers!",1
2797,Great location nice workers for the most part. Need more workers to manage the rush,1
2798,So glad we got to go when we were in town. Delicious!!!!,1
2799,"Very crowded, average hotdog & fries",1
2800,"You can never go wrong when choosing food at Portillo's. Their chargrilled hamburgers are absolutely fantastic! They have classic Chicago-style beef, nice and crispy onion rings, Fresh & crispy french fries. Then on the healthier side they have lots of wonderful handmade salad's including chicken, strawberries, and lots of other ingredients. They make the salads right there in front of you and you could pick ingredients that you want don't what. There are plenty of places for a large group or even a single person to sit. They serve beer and wine if that is what you desire, they also have excellent handmade milkshakes as well as all the other classic soft drinks. Finally, a trip to Portillo's will not be complete until you get a piece of their fantastic chocolate cake!",1
2801,Some of the best hotdogs I’ve had in a long time. This is great food no matter what you get. The milkshakes are incredible as well. It’s also a fun atmosphere to spend some time in with a crowd. I would highly recommend to anyone and I definitely plan on coming back sometime soon!,1
2802,"I had the Portillo's beef hotdog, fries, and the salted caramel milkshake! It was all very good! The place is pretty large and the service was fast. I would highly recommend!",1
2803,"Sooo good! I had never had a Chicago hot dog and I got back in line to have one more. They are pretty small so make sure to just order two the first round. You order first, sit down then they call out your number. Pretty fast to get your food too.",1
2804,I loved it!! I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich a small onion ring and small fry. Walked back to my hotel and my food was still hot and fresh. I will be eating there again before we leave!!,1
2805,Love the atmosphere and the char-grilled Maxwell street polish sausage. Would definitely go back again,1
2806,One of my favourite meals during my Chicago trip!!!,1
2807,Love this place the location on Brookfield can sometimes be busy and your food is not as fresh otherwise it's good,1
2808,"First time trying a Chicago Hot Dog, and I am impressed!  If you're in the area, definitely swing by to check out the vibe.  It's old-Chicago cool inside with lots of seating on 2 levels.  The menu is divided into different areas for ordering, but it only took me 10 seconds to figure it out on my first trip.  Staff is quick and friendly, and the food is awesome!!  I had a jumbo hot dog and fires.  Great place, highly recommended!",1
2809,"Great experience, good food and even better prices!",1
2810,"It fast food, and not at it's finest. I don't hate it, I just had higher expectations for something more like craft dogs and I just got a hot dog, with an underselling bun and a strangely-colored relish that reminded me of neon lights. I don't hate it, I just don't love it.",1
2811,"Pretty high expectations of this place since a few friends of mine recommended it even though it's considered ""fast food"" and the expectations were met! This hotdog was worth the wait. The wait was surprising when I first walked in, but the place looks great along with the cheese with my cheese fries.",1
2812,Loved this portillos the original location. In chi-town the food was more delicious here. Than the one back home authentic Chicago style highly recommended it.,1
2813,"Portillo’s Hot Dogs are the best dogs in the Midwest.  I can’t come to Chicago and not stop by Portillo’s.  Each and every dish is delicious.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

I think the Cobb salad is a great dish and has great value.  If you come to Portillo’s you need to try their Hot Dogs.  It’s a must, you won’t be disappointed.

Thank you for the great service and the incredible meal again and again.  Thanks to top quality service like this you better believe we will be back.",1
2814,"Long long wait for the orders because this place is so busy. Had Italian beef as always, hot peppers add-on is a must, makes it more savory, soaked buns were kinda nice too, not a fan of cake shakes",1
2815,"Efficient drive up, best way to get food. Note: No parking. Good beef sammie’s, etc
Salads, chocolate cake to die for!",1
2816,"Solid dogs, great flavor and price, Greg Miller & Portillo approved!",1
2817,"We came here on a recommendation of the hot dog and the chocolate cake shake. The hot dog was really great; I’m a New Yorker who’s grown up used to hot dogs with mustard, relish and nothing else, but I can respect the Chicago dog (with onions, chili peppers, a pickle and some other stuff) as another way to eat them.

The shake was about as advertised, and I should’ve guessed it would be amazingly thick! It was still pretty good, but I couldn’t finish the whole thing and I would probably rather have a normal chocolate milkshake.

All in all, though, well worth a visit; the ambience is great also.",1
2818,"Portillos is an excellent place to get a quick Chicago bite. As a non Chicagoan living here I don't have the blind love most locals do for it, however I have a solid appreciation for it. I don't know that they do one thing excellent, but they do many things very well and that's worth something in my eyes. Definitely recommend!",1
2819,"I remember liking this place a lot more than I did. There are so many other delicious hamburger and hot dog places in Chicago that are much better than here. The fries were not good, I prefer a nice crunch to my fries and these were almost soggy. The bacon cheeseburger was fine, not bad, but not great either.",1
2820,"I ordered the sausage - nothing wrong with it, it tasted fine (a little dry). My BF got the Italian beef, a better choice. All in all I don't get the hype, it was fine, but not memorable for me.",1
2821,Heard about this place and decided to get off one of those bus tours to grab a bite and see what this place was all about! Long wait for food so be prepared. It was a bit chaotic but one guy saw us waiting forever and tried to help us get our food. Ended up.with a partial order but after waiting that long I wasn't going to try to sort it out. Food was pretty decent but the ambiance is what you get. It feels Chicago- like inside so check it out!,1
2822,BEST AUTHENTIC Midwestern restaurant. Very affordable and delicious. My first lunch stop when visiting Chicago!,1
2823,"The hot dog and chocolate cake we ordered was good. However, the polish dog was burned and hard. We waited nearly 45 min for just a few items; we didn’t have time to wait for another polish dog. Not the best experience. There may be better choices that also have lines but without the hard and burnt polish dogs.",1
2824,Best family friendly restaurant in Chi-town!,1
2825,Very interesting place with very interesting decor. We came on a Saturday night and it was crazy packed. It didn’t take longer than 15 min to get our food. I had their hot dog and cheese fries. The hot dog was AMAZING. So so good. The fries were great too. It was so good I wished I would have ordered two of them. Definitely will be back.,1
2826,"Their shake 😍,  and the people , and the bbq ribs! Can't go wrong!.",1
2827,Portillo's is an iconic Chicago landmark and it is a vital attraction for any Chicago tourist. The interior is beautiful with great seating and the food is spectacular. Best chocolate cake in the world! The service is very good and it is very sanitary. Great place to go to with a group of friends for a chill dinner. Shoutout to Portillo's!,1
2828,"Portillo’s is always a great pick for lunch or dinner. The food is reliably great, there are plenty of options to choose from, and the prices are very reasonable. Hard to find this quality of food in a drive through anywhere else in the city. Like everyone, I highly recommend the cake shake, but my personably favorites are the beef and cheddar croissant and the chopped salad.",1
2829,"We ate at the 100 W. Ontario, Chicago location. We chose the restaurant because of the positive reviews online. The food was pretty good, but not great...but I think this might be more because I'm not fond of traditional ""Chicago food"" (greasy hot dogs, greasy beef sandwiches, etc) than a real reflection on the food? We ordered hot dogs, pasta, french fries, and chili. The bread that came with the chili and pasta was very warm and yummy! But I made the mistake of ordering a pasta dish...not very Chicago, and not very palatable, lacking spices. The wait, from ordering until the food was ready, was exceptionally long and exhausting. The atmosphere was super fun and lively, and is what I enjoyed more than the actual food. We ate upstairs and it was pleasant, and our table had a nice window-view of the rain-wet city streets outside.",1
2830,It's nice to know you can always count on quality of product and service,1
2831,Tasty Chicago style hot dogs at a fair price. Service is fast and plenty of indoor seating.,1
2832,THE Chicago experience --  HOT DOGS!!!  Ambiance is fun and lively. You have NOT had a real hot dog untll you've had one here. Dee-lish!!!  Go there.  Now.,1
2833,I expected a little morefrom the hotdogs but the were very very good. The atmosphere was awesome.  Lots to look at. Great experience.,1
2834,Horrible service.they forgot out order then when they remade my order it was cold and thrown together then when I took it back too them it was barely prepared right.love portillos food just have to go to a different location this one is too busy and they don't prepare the food as well.,0
2835,You've never had a hotdog if you've never had Portillo's Fairly quick service even when they're crowded. Fun atmosphere with lots of Chicago memorabilia to look at!,1
2836,"OK. I'm giving 5 stars for the food and the general atmosphere. Bear in mind you will probably wait for your order longer than you will spend eating it. It's a pretty chaotic experience but i guess that just stands as testament to it's popularity. The food was excellent, I had 2 classic hotdogs (one won't be enough for most) and some cheese fries. Just be warned that it's a bit crazy ordering and collecting your food.",1
2837,"Our order was taken by a pleasant young lady who was efficient and knowledgeable. The place was crowded, so we knew the food must be good. And it was. How difficult can it be to make and serve a good hot dog & fries with drinks?

We chose a table for two by the staircase to the second floor area which was closed. All of the tables around us were occupied. The decor is old time Chicago, so we had plenty to take in visually while we waited for our food and while we ate it. It was noisier than other places, so we didn’t talk much. My husband heard our number called, and got our 3 hotdogs, large fries and drinks at the pick up area. It wasn’t a cheap dinner, but it wasn’t expensive either.

Our hot dogs were good. So were the fries. Nothing was overly greasy or overcooked. My husband is a big fan, and will go out of his way to enjoy a Portillo’s hot dog at home in Tampa. Tonight he relished his plain dogs in Chicago, the birthplace of Portillo’s. I enjoyed my meal, but it didn’t overwhelm me. So if you want a good hot dog and an order of fries, with lots of Chicago ambiance, then come to Portillo’s.",1
2838,"This is a Chicago staple. If you're a fan of Chicago style hot dogs and cheese fries, you have to try it at least once.",1
2839,"It was meh, I've had better Chicago dogs locally. Bun lacked flavor and pickled goods felt flat as well. Service was relatively quick given the lines.",0
2840,"Long lines but it moved quickly. Good food and great Chicago atmosphere. Their hot dogs are great, but I don’t recommend their beef and cheddar croissant. Croissant gets soggy by the time you get it to the table, and it’s a mess to eat. Their table service and clean-up was good, even though they were very busy.",1
2841,"no line, and the Italian beef was awesome!",1
2842,"First time trying out Portillo's Hot Dogs. Fast, casual place where you place your order at the counter and pick it up at another. The service was good. Friendly and helpful. I ordered the Italian Beef and the Famous Portillo's Hot Dog and Cheesy Fries. The Hot Dog was just okay for me. I'm not really a hot dog person to begin with. Its loaded with everything, cucumbers and tomatoes with hot peppers. Taste was good, love all the toppings but I find the buns pretty soggy, maybe its from all the topping. The Italian Beef with extra gravy however was very good. Its loaded with juicy beef. Perfectly seasoned, so moist. I Loved it. The fries was okay, they give you a cheese sauce on a separate container. This location vibe and ambience was very good. Its clean and huge dining area.",1
2843,Hello treated the worse IV ever Ben they got my order wrong tried to call hung up on me then tried again put me on hold whent back to the place still holding phone on hold whent up to the lady that took my order name of her satores got very violent with me then the manager she called nichole wasn't very nice got rude with my wife then she give me my correct which was sitting in the back of grill for hour cold that's what I got for 30 dollers I will calling main office till I get satisfaction,0
2844,The hot dogs are great. The Italian beef is pretty good. The atmosphere is fantastic!,1
2845,"Busy but exciting atmosphere, and the food options were great! I had deep dish pizza during my weekend visit to Chicago but I kept thinking back to this place. It was packed but they moved through everyone's order quickly and efficiently but were very helpful with questions and preferences and the like. Highly recommend. We had a classic dog, chili cheese dog, and an Italian beef sandwich.",1
2846,"best way to describe this place is complete organize chaos. The everything hot dog are amazing. Highly recommended, 3 star is for one of the worker yelling at me for taking a video(snap chat) of them prepping food. He said I am not allowed too. Never had a problem at any of the other location.",1
2847,"Delicious Chicago-style hot dogs. Decent burgers. Excellent fries. It's a little touristy, but a great Chicago experience. Worth a visit if you've see the top sights and are ready to move on to your second tier items.",1
2848,"Food was good, very popular by the amount of people in the place.",1
2849,"I came here to get a Chicago hotdog in summer 2018, and it was very average. I got in line to pay for one, and then I waited forever to get it. They forgot my order. Actually, I'm pretty sure they called my number but someone else took my food, and when I went up, they said they hadn't called my number. So I continued waiting for more than ten minutes until I decided to tell them again because nobody waiting for their food was in front of me in line. They finally gave me my hotdog, and it was very mediocre. Tasted like an average hot dog; not much flavor but had a bunch of fluff around it, which is Chicago style I guess!",1
2850,"Chicago favorite. Love the italian beef, combined with sausage if want to push it is excellent. But have options, Chicken croissant, charred burger and even salad and good pasta options. Cold beer!",1
2851,Great food. We did takeout.,1
2852,"I'm not a fan unfortunately... I had high hopes especially because there was a line for the restaurant. The hot dog with everything on it was cold and Soggy so it seems like they pre-made them, and the beef sandwich was also soggy however I would have let that slide if there was some type of flavoring to the meat, and or gravy.",0
2853,"Very efficient, as always. They get you in, get your order, get you out......This day the drive thru wa only backed up to the street. When you see the line of cars go out and around the corner don't let that discourage you because if you take a good look at that line it is constantly moving you will be out of that line satisfying your hunger in no time!",1
2854,The hot dog was very good. I had never had a Chicago style hot dog so wasn't sure if I would like it so I also go a burger. I want that impressed with the burger or fries. The bun on the burger was too much bread. The fries were just meh. The hot dog was awesome. Lines were long so I could tell this place is popular. It was a little chaotic but an interesting place.,1
2855,"Hot dogs were ok.  Staff not very nice.  No one in front of us but yet everyone after us, at least 10, received their order first and when I said something then my order was ready.  Went because it was recommended but it didn't live up to the hype",0
2856,A good place for travelers to taste traditional Chicago hot dog!,1
2857,Very disorganized place and over crowded place to wait for mediocre quality food. Not worth it. Rude staff.,0
2858,Nice food. Famous Chicago hot dog.,1
2859,"Great hot dog, even better chocolate cake!!",1
2860,"I know this won't even make a mark. I ordered 270 bucks of food for delivery, It was delivered 35 minutes late, and missed out on about 100 bucks of the order. Tried to call, and got through to the order desk, but trying to get a manager for resolution took four phone calls.....finally was just told to leave a voice mail. Left a voice mail, sent an email, and now leaving a bad review. Maybe the just dont care.....",0
2861,Good food but rude workers without any manners. They don’t follow the list for online orders. They give you dirty looks because you have been waiting for your online order. They don’t care about anything. Have patience if you order online because you’ll have to deal with nasty people at the online orders desk.,0
2862,"Soggy dog, artificial relish. Go try one just to say you did.",0
2863,"Always a good place to take my tourist friends, always clean, always the good scenario!",1
2864,"Great food. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff and the staff was disorganized. They got my order wrong, and it took 20+ minutes to get a small side of gravy for my sandwich. In their defense the place was packed solid, and even I could not have fixed a mistake any sooner working at that breakneck speed.

The food was amazing. A must visit if you're in Chicago.",1
2865,Ordered fries and a drink with my sandwich but didn't get either..,1
2866,I ordered an Italian beef with cheese and hot peppers and this is what I got! If I could leave zero stars I would have. This is a disgrace to the Portillos brand.,0
2867,"Great job, Portillos! Utilized the drive-thru. We received the order very quickly. So fast we had to wait for cars to move so we could exit the drive thru. Food was perfect temperature and ketchup packets cold.",1
2868,I'd rather wait at the DMV than experience portillos online ordering experience. Want to wait for 30-40 minutes past the pickup time? Then this is the place for you. Doesn't get more inept than that setup.,0
2869,"first time. ate my way through it all, great chicago history. no regerts!",1
2870,"I loved the Italian Beef and Chili Cheese Dogs here! It was good and cheap! This is a great place to go eat when you don't know where to go eat. The decor is fun and truly a fun place to experience.

The staff was a little rude but the food made up for it I guess.",1
2871,"Fantastic location, very big and all the tables were clean. Food came out fast and fresh. I love the Italian beef with hot peppers. Their fries are out of this world. The service was very friendly. This is fast food but as it really should be.",1
2872,This place is amazing! The food is so good and the staff is fun and very very friendly! Definitely a must when visiting Chicago!,1
2873,Yummy and quick!  Even put all our topping on the side for safe traveling,1
2874,My family and I were in Chicago for vacation and were looking for something other than pizza. Portillos was about a block from our hotel and what a jewel it was. The Italian beef sandwich was the bomb!!!! My wife tried the mostaccioli and my son went for spaghetti and both were totally enjoying. Of course we all tried each other's meal and that's how Portillos became our go to dinner spot for the week!!!!,1
2875,"We had Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers, Chicago dog and sausage sandwich. Italian beef sandwich was the best, comes with extra gravy which is just right. Chicago dog was good too.

Came back again the next day for another Italian beef. Very  crazy crowded on a Saturday, not as crowded Sunday. Worth the wait.",1
2876,"After waiting 15 minutes to place my order, food was served lukewarm...unacceptable",0
2877,"I ordered a single bacon burger and was tang up and given a double cheeseburger, the fries were barely even room temp. The only thing that was good and right was the malt. The staff seems to not care about the customer nor there job. Make this a last resort place to eat if you’re in Chicago.",0
2878,"My family and I were in Chicago for a week and this was the absolute best meal we had (and cheapest meal!). The Chicago dogs cannot be missed and the Italian Beef is extraordinary. They also have really good fries.

I missed out on the chocolate shake, but I've heard it's amazing. It's essentially a big piece of chocolate cake that they toss in a blender. How could you go wrong?",1
2879,Nice place. Good food  Very good price. I loved the decoration of the place,1
2880,First time to Portillos and I am absolutely impressed. Honestly this place was better than the reviews I've heard and I heard some stellar reviews. This is an absolute MUST next time I'm in Chicago,1
2881,Ordered from grubHub. Special request on 2 hotdogs. Did not follow the directions received half of our order missing cheese fries and was missing a chop salad only received a hotdog and a shake with no straw in the bag. For my Dad in the hospital very unhappy with the service from Portillo’s.,0
2882,"Really good grub, only wish that I would have had some cheese sauce.",1
2883,"Before my recent visit to Chicago, my cousin recommended Portillo's. Specifically, the hot dog and the chocolate cake shake. I ordered both when I got to Chicago, and they did not disappoint. I normally don't put that many toppings on my hot dogs, but I might start. I actually went back and ordered a jumbo hot dog after finishing the normal size hot dog. Both were delicious, but of course the jumbo was a bit more satisfying. And the chocolate cake shake was fantastic as well.",1
2884,Portillo's is a gem of the North Loop. The food is great and the atmosphere is outstanding. A great family & friends spot!!!,1
2885,"Delicious as always! Don't come to this location at lunchtime if you are in a hurry. Came here over Chicago Marathon weekend and had to wait around forty five (45) minutes to get a couple of hot dogs and a soda. Worth the wait for the quality, though!",1
2886,"This place is really busy and the decor is fun.  The lines are long, but move quickly. However, you may wait awhile for your food and if you order a salad you need to pick it up at a different window. Crazy. The hot dog was good. A little soggy, but I decided to eat at the hotel instead of the restaurant so the bun was a little mushy. Their ""famous"" chocolate cake was very good, but nothing major. I'd go back. It's a fun place.",1
2887,"I get the same thing every time, big beef with mozzarella cheese and hot peppers *dipped* and cheese fries. They never do me wrong, it never gets old and the employees are always sweet people. HIGHLY recommend going or you're missing out.",1
2888,"Visited Chicago again and tried this Portillo's location again. Much better the second time around. I enjoyed the hot dog and the fries.

Original review, 1*: Probably the worst hot dog I've had. Not much else to say, we also had fries and they were below average as well.",1
2889,Great place! There was an angry man that loved the food so much he pounded and yelled for it. A patron named Debbie was prepared with two salt shakers if it got of control.,1
2890,"Why even bother visiting it? Hot dogs were small to fit the price and while they had their own little touch, Circle K makes just better, bigger hot dogs in my country. Place is packed too with long lines. Interior was good.

The place was still good, make no mistake, just don't come expecting anything outstanding hot dog wise.",1
2891,"We really like this place as a family and get takeout often.   Wife likes salads, boys the meatball subs, I love the beef sandwich with sweet peppers- yum! Good value. We use the app.  Great chocolate cake.  Burgers haven’t been as popular with my boys- they prefer Culver’s.  Hope this helps.",1
2892,Service could be better but food was great!,1
2893,"For the amount of people they have it wasn't too bad the waiting time, I was here 15 years ago and everything still the same, I'd say restrooms will need a little remodeling soon... Food delicious!",1
2894,Portillos is definitely a spot to check out in Chicago,1
2895,"I had heard great things about this spot but I did not like it at all.  The italian beef sandwich was very, very bland.  Even the chili dog wasn't good.  Very disappointed.",0
2896,"I visited it on 9/25/19. Ordered a Chicago dog, a drink, and fries. The bread felt fragile and did not look attractive. Once I tasted the hot dog, I was glad I decided to eat at Portillo's. It was a delicious dog and the fries were average, but I was there to try one of their dogs for the first time. Anyone who visits Chicago should give it a try. They have burgers, sandwiches, a great variety of hot dogs, etc.
The place was clean and employees were friendly, which was not common in most places I visited in Chicago. Also, this Portillo's loccation is in a way a museum of the City of old Chicago. I really liked the items they have salvaged from different historical sites. I would visit again in the future.",1
2897,Delicious that's all I can say.. lol,1
2898,"I reluctantly really like portillo's.  They made me wait forever for my order and it took like three employees and a manager to get me an Italian beef and fries, but they were really good fries and an excellent Italian beef.  It's a quick Chicago staple.  If it's a tourist attraction it's worth it because it's cheap, fast, and good.  Go Brewers!",1
2899,Great place to grab a Chicago-style hot dog. Delicious food and comfortable atmosphere. Love the decor too!,1
2900,They exceed expectations. I love their combo sandwich (sausage and beef). And their strawberry milkshake is also very good.,1
2901,"The famous Italian beef is alright, especially for the price, juicy and flavorful for what seems like a cheap fast food  cheese steak without the cheese.  Make sure you get it with at least extra gravy if not more.  Adding some cheese fries and ketchup on it elevated it to amazing.

The Chicago dog was AWESOME. Loved the pickles and peppers accentuating the red hot on a sweet and chewy bun.  I would make sure to visit a few times on each trip to Chicago.

Strawberry daiquiri was nice, not too sweet and full of tang, not much booze though which is fine if you just want a frozen strawberry drink.",1
2902,"The polish and Chicago dogs are very good. And the eclair cake is to die for.  The fries are just blah.  I would’ve spend the money on the fries, just get another dog or more dessert.  I used grub hub and it was mostly a good experience but they didn’t give us our chocolate cake we paid for.  So sad. Overall a good experience and the dogs are amazing.",1
2903,The best food service I’ve ever received,1
2904,"The decor has neat artifacts from past Chicago sports stadiums, teams, and other items that are cool.
The ordering method and food mimic a ballpark experience. Lots of hot dogs, burgers, etc.
we had burgers and chicken strips. They were good as were the fries and drinks.
Not too expensive. Staff was swamped and dealing w Covid complications. Floors, tables, and especially the bathrooms were needing a scrubbing.",1
2905,"Hands down one of my favorite places to eat. This was my first time at this particular location and it was a great experience. The location is the off the magnificent mile and easy to get to. The food always seems to taste better every time I eat there. I recommend the spicy Italian beef with light gravy! Price is not bad either for as popular as it has become. If you come to Chicago, this is a must eat.",1
2906,"Ordered online and the food wasn't ready when I arrived. They had to make my order leaving us to wait longer than we should've had to. When we got the food home tonight, it was not made as I specified. 2 Italian beefs with cheese and hot peppers dipped and a combination dipped with hot peppers and three small fries manifested as 2 absolute plain beef sandwiches slightly wet and some cold limp fries. We thought we were late picking up the order...NOT. Almost $40 for this disappointment. I've never had a problem at this location before, but tonight, this was just a bad experience.",0
2907,The drive-thru was convenient. The food was fast. The food was extremely delicious. The food was scratched. All I can say is I'll certainly be back. go for the jumbo Chicago dog. You won't be disappointed.,1
2908,Best Chicago Dog! Loooved this hotdog onion rings were also amazing!!!!,1
2909,Best place in Chicago for authentic Chicago style hotdogs. I make it a priority to stop into Portillos every time I'm in Chicago,1
2910,This is a must do every time in Chicago.  Amazing food!,1
2911,Sucked Wrigley stadium hot dog 10x better,0
2912,"So, apart from the atmosphere, I don't get this thing with Chicago hot dogs and Portillo's specifically.  The atmosphere was awesome.  The bun was great, but I don't know if we didn't order the right hot dog, but it just was not what I would consider a good hot dog.  Just personal opinion, so don't hate please.  The hot dogs we have here are totally different, and its just not at all what I was expecting.",0
2913,"Our order was delivered and they got it completely wrong, not sure what they were thinking when they sent this one. Then the driver delivered to the wrong location, next door neighbor so luckily we heard the driver leave. My wife called in and explained that our order was wrong and they said that they would have the correct order delivered ASAP. 3 hours later and we still don’t have our dinner.",0
2914,"Really good Chicago dogs at surprisingly great prices. It was a little crowded, but the lines moved very quickly. Was pleased to find outdoor seating, as inside was a little loud and warm. There are two different lines inside - one for hot dogs and one for pasta (Barnelli's). My friend had the soup from the pasta line and said it was really good.",1
2915,"My favorite place for hot dogs! Friends from college have moved out and they often tell me how often they miss Portillo's (One of them even once every few months asks me or another of his friends to order some of the food and ship it out to him in Arizona!). This place gets a lot of praise, and it deserves it! I love the hot dogs and the burgers are good for their price. The Italian beef is also nice. Onion rings here rock! Really crispy and not oily. YES! This location does get really crowdy, but the people who work here do their best to keep things going in an orderly manner. Plus I don't mind waiting in line and admiring the look of this place. My only one complaint is the one time I ordered a hot dog and got ketchup in it. Ketchup on my Chicago dog. I felt like calling the police. But they were nice about making me a new one, but no star for you!!!",1
2916,"Was super excited to order, but they forgot all of the sides dips. I ordered dry to make sure I could dip. Really disappointed..",0
2917,"Came here because of the reputation of the restaurant. Was packed, but staff definitely were quick and efficient to get their customers in and have their food. Nothing special about the food if I’m being completely honest. Enjoyed more the experience and the aesthetic of the restaurant.",1
2918,"Food was okay, milkshake was good, and the food came pretty quickly.

I didn't enjoy the super hectic atmosphere and the ordering/pick-up experience that was less coordinated than your average McDonald's. If you needed help from one of the staff it was a competition in getting their attention because they were all super busy trying to get stuff pushed through.

My table mates were split half and half in loving the food and hating it. I wouldn't go again.",0
2919,Best polish sausage 🌭🌭🌭 in the galaxy💯,1
2920,We came here for restaurant week dinner. The service was great at first until our server disappeared after the second course was out. The food were great and my personal favorite was the meatballs. We ordered a brussel sprouts too but we never got it and had to cancel it at the end. Overall the food here is worth coming but service could be better.,1
2921,Some of the best Italian inspired food in Chicago. Creative menu with unique flavors. The bread with whipped ricotta and honey was incredible and I highly recommend it as an appetizer. Pasta sizes are smaller. Desserts were good but not excellent.,1
2922,"The restaurant was booked and upon calling the staff made it possible for us to get a high table. The pasta came out in five ten minutes and was excellent. Ryan, our waiter was kind, curious, and gave exceptional service. 5 Stars 10/10 Highly Recommend",1
2923,"Meal was excellent. Pasta sizes are on the smaller side, so we ordered a pasta to share between the two of us, and each of us got our own entree as well. The Brussels sprouts were especially good. We would go back.",1
2924,"RPM is a great restaurant to visit. They have some great food choices like octopus, squid ink pasta. The serving size is smaller and the price is steeper. The salmon I ordered was a tiny 2 inches by 2 inches piece. The grilled octopus was ok, though some of the long thin arms were crisper. For fans of fried Brussels sprouts,theirs is good",1
2925,"First time at RPM Italian.  We been to the other two RPMs and Italian did not disappoint.  From the service, food, atmosphere, and experience it was all great.  We love how they spread out their meals and the menu.  We started off with apps, then had two small pastas that we shared, then had an entree that we shared.  All spread out with appropriate time between.",1
2926,"While the overall aesthetic of RPM Italian is a vibe, the food has a lot of muted flavors. For instance, you know that a dish has garlic, but the garlic flavor is very light and missing the boldness you would expect from the dish. As for customer service, i am Black and I noticed on several occasions my waiter at the bar voluntarily communicated only with white customers but ignored me unless I had to flagged him down. While that one bartender’s act didn’t drastically alter my experience, it didn’t sit well with me. Overall, based on those two things I would not go back RPM Italian.",1
2927,"One of my wife and I’s favorite Italian restaurants. Been here 3 times now and it never disappoints. One of the best old fashioneds I’ve ever had and incredible pasta dishes that are fresh and very authentic. Amazing atmosphere, experience, and service",1
2928,"Tira MISS U

Going to miss Chicago and the amazing restaurants I’ve been able to try. We went to @rpmitalian to celebrate promotions at work and have a goodbye dinner for me. We had some delicious meals but first I want to high the desserts (are you surprised? No). I’m not a huge fan of tiramisu but really wanted wanted to try it here and was so glad I did! We also tried the bomboloni (Italian donuts). Both were amazing and a great end to this meal. More photos to come of the awesome food!

This might sound cheesy but this meal was grate

Here are those additional food photos from @rpmitalian ! Featured here is the burrata appetizer with cherry basaltic, sweet corn agnolotti with ricotta and Australian black truffle, Australian black truffle risotto with aged Parmesan and shaved fresh truffle, & short rib bolognese pappardelle and rosemary (so good I couldn’t get a picture before my friend dug in!). All was so amazing!

Spritz and giggles

Which is exactly what happened the other night at @rpmitalian while my friends had a drink named this! We drank and we giggled some! I tried the Paloma Swizzle (because if you know me, I go for tequila, especially @casamigos paired with grapefruit) and my friends had the Spritz & Giggles cocktail which consisted of Prosecco, vodka, and raspberry. Then, when we sat down to eat, we ordered a bottle of a great white wine S’elegas, from @argiolaswinery",1
2929,"I'm really torn between 3 and 4 stars but I guess I'll round up to 4 because our easier was very attentive and made our dining experience very pleasurable. The ambiance of this place is great, very modern Italian eatery. Again our waiter was very attentive but not overbearing which we really appreciate. Unfortunately the food was very meh. My favorite things were the truffle garlic bread and truffle risotto. Maybe I just really like truffle idk. The steak was cooked a little rare for my liking. Usually I like ribeye at medium rare to medium so they give the fat a chance to really render. Tuna crudo was good but underwhelming. You can tell they had very high quality tuna though. Lobster ravioli was ok as well. There was a very strong flavor of brandy or cognac in this that I didn't enjoy. I just thought it was a little heavy handed. Octopus was prepared perfectly texture wise, but the flavors were meh. Truffle garlic bread was delicious. Thought it was going to be too much carbs but glad I got it. Risotto was a little salty for my gfs rate, but I like salty food so it was still in my delicious range. I can see how one word say it's too salty though. Haven't decided if I will go back, but if I do I definitely won't order the steak again. Maybe that was my mistake to begin with?",1
2930,"Gorgeous ambiance. Okay-ish good considering the surroundings. We ordered the lobster ravioli. It was meh. The truffle toast was pretty yummy.
Drinks are super pricy. The service is amazing. Playing is beautiful.
I wouldn’t come again if looking for top notch food.",1
2931,"Great experience! We went for my husband’s Birthday with a group of 6 so we had a chance to try a good variety from the menu! The ricotta & honey appetizer was amazing, the bread was perfection! The meatballs were also delicious! The brussel sprouts side dish was phenomenal, so crispy! For entree, I had the Ricotta Cavatelli, definitely would recommend, the pork was super tender and had just the right amount of ricotta to balance the dish. For dessert we tried the RPM Cheesecake and Bomboloni (donuts). The donuts were absolutely amazing, a must try! We also enjoyed the complimentary birthday dessert and honorable mention to the wine/cocktails which were just as expected. Service was great as well!",1
2932,To start the white trufle warm bread was amazing and highly recommend. The drinks where on point and added to a great evening. The main course went with noodle dishes as it’s a Italian restaurant and was also not disappointed. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The flavors where fresh and authentic. Only change I would see is to make four smaller meat balls over one big one. That would allow the meat to cook evenly and not over cook the outer portion. The desserts wheee a good not great end to the evening. The cheesecake was more NY style creamy and heavy. I wish it was lighter that would help with the sour cherries and cream on top. The gelato was some of the best I had. The tiramisu was ok I expected better. To wrap it up. Was the food good? Yes. Was the food worth the price I paid? Yes. Was the experience good? Yes. Only reason for four stars was for some things that could of been better.,1
2933,"Decor: chic and comfortable
Food: classic dishes with quality ingredients.  The squid in pasta is a must try.
Staff: detail oriented and provide top tier quality of service",1
2934,Two things: 1) Quite good; and 2) Higher end pricing.  That said...so good.   had a number of different apps that all hit the spot (the meatballs and prosciutto were memorable).  After the apps was worried that I wouldn't have room for a pasta dish...not a problem.  Their dishes are small in amount but big in taste.  Had the shortrib pasta and it hit the spot.  All was so good...even their ice cubes are slick!,1
2935,Excellent food and service. Make a reservation (we made an 8pm res at 4 oclock the same day). The tortellini was outstanding!,1
2936,Great service.  Tasty cocktail.  Cesar Salad and truffle garlic bread were delicious.  Enjoyed the beed meatballs.  First time having cacio e pepe...so good will definitely try again in the future.  Third time at RPM...will be back the next time I'm in Chicago.,1
2937,The meatballs and truffle garlic bread were excellent. We enjoyed every course. The chicken vesuvio is a great portion.,1
2938,"My friend from home recommended RPM Italian as a must-do in Chicago!

The food was INCREDIBLE however; I was a little disappointed with the service. I made a rezzo and we were sat at a nice booth by the gorgeous bar. The restaurant was very busy but there was lots of staff & managers working the floor. We ordered 3 espresso martinis (delicious) and then waited over 15 mins for our server to come back before we gestured to a manager. He was very nice and took our order immediately! Our food came quickly and was so damn good; highly recommended the octopus app, burrata, prosciutto & buratta tortelli (I am a cheese girl!) The octopus may have been the star of the evening; so fresh & flavourful. The server was attentive after that but it felt uncomfortable; as a server myself, you can feel the energy and nobody remembers how you messed up - it’s how you remedy the situation that matters! Overall, happy with my experience & the ambience is stellar.

PICTURED: espresso martinis, grilled octopus, house made ricotta & fresh bread, prosciutto, brussel sprout salad, spicy crab squid ink & burrata tortelli.",1
2939,"My first impression of the restaurant was very positive, as the overall vibe was a nice mix of upscale and trendy. The mix of the lighting, seating, music, etc. definitely stood out and made for a great and fun dinner atmosphere. The Prime Beef Meatballs was easily our favorite dish of the night. The meat itself was very tender and the sauce was delicious. The Short Rib Bolognese and Cacio e Pepe were unfortunately more of a mixed bag. The bolognese was pretty good, with the beef coming out very tender and exactly as one would expect from a short rib dish like this. We asked for it to be prepared a little on the spicier side and were glad that we did. The Cacio e Pepe, though, was very disappointing. It was definitely on the dry side and lacked much flavor in general. The side dish of Crispy Brussels Sprouts were solid, with a good crunchy texture. For dessert, the Bill's Chocolate Budino ended up being a pretty tasty option. The addition of cocoa nibs on top was a nice topping to balance out the mostly soft moussy texture and sweet caramel/chocolate flavor. Coupling all of that with the great service we received by Andrew and I'd say this was a great date night spot in town.",1
2940,"The best thing about this place was the service. Food was mediocre and bland. I’ve been to rpm steak/seafood which were great but for only 2 entrees and an app, you’d expect the cost of the bill would be justified by quality food. I ordered the wagyu and I highly doubt that’s actually what I had. I’ve had it multiple times before and this surely didn’t even compare to other experiences. Really disappointed with the cost to quality ratio this restaurant delivered.",0
2941,"I stopped by with my wife here for a Sunday dinner as this is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in Chicago. It holds a special place in our hearts as this was our first experience eating at an upscale restaurant, and I took her to dinner here right before I asked her to marry me a little over 2 years ago. Needless to say, maybe I am a bit biased, but only because they hooked us from our first time dining here, and, even through the 100+ restaurants we've probably been to, RPM Italian continues to serve some of the tastiest food in the city.

From the moment we entered, were greeted by warm smiles and modern, pop music. The atmosphere is more geared toward a cool lounge than a romantic sit-down. We were sat promptly at our table, served water, and got our drink order taken. I went with a classic Old Fashioned, while my wife went with a glass of Rosé. My Old Fashioned was perfectly mixed, and almost went through one drink before entrées were served. We started with the whipped Ricotta and honey with warm bread. Though skeptical looking at the small pool of honey, it tasted delicious mixed with the Ricotta on the warm, fluffy bread.

For our main entrées, I ordered the chicken parmesan and short rib bolognese, and my wife had the spaghetti and meatballs and mashed potatoes. The chicken parmesan came with spaghetti itself, thus, the food was plentiful, and even better, the food was delicious! The pasta, whether it was the bolognese or the spaghetti, was cooked perfectly. The sauce was not runny but not very thick, was not oily, and tasted great! My chicken was tender and juicy, the breading and seasoning being right on the money; the added parmesan on top brought the classical flavors together, and could not stop eating. The meatball tasted yummy and was almost pillow-soft to the bite. As for the mashed potatoes, though stood out flavor-wise as it did not match with the rest of the Italian flavors, stood out in a good way, as they were fluffy, the garlic being prominent, but not terribly so. We ended with the tiramisu for dessert, and this was an outstanding closure to our meal.

I would highly recommend RPM to anyone, as the food is delicious, the vibe is modern, the service is fantastic, and the drinks are refreshing. It is one of my personal favorites, and will continue coming back!",1
2942,"We ate a big dinner for two people. That being said, it was an amazing dinner and we were treated like royalty by James. We started with the beef tartare, Caesar salad, and zucchini fritti. The beef tartare was perfect and such a clean dish, tender but not too soft. Then we had grilled prawns, ribeye steak, garlic whipped potatoes, and squid ink spicy crab pasta. The real stars were the ribeye and the prawns, which were both to die for. The server recommended a very nice bottle of red to pair with everything which we throughly enjoyed! Finished with dessert cocktails and bomboloni as well as affrogatto. Such a lovely experience at RPM Italian.",1
2943,This was a good experience. The hostess was helpful and informative and we were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation time. We ordered the chicken parmesan which was well cooked and had an amazing marinara pasta side. The kitchen easily split our order onto two plates. We shared the fried zucchini appetizer and the truffle bread as well. The pasta is truly cooled al dente and as seen in other reviews they will mix it in front of you. Overall a nice time with good food.,1
2944,"Our server Vanessa was great!! For a Saturday night she was on so good when checking in on us. Everything we had was amazing. Bruschetta, carbonara, spicy king crab squid ink spaghetti!!! Lettuce, take note of Vanessa!

The bar on the other hand,  was beyond busy. Took forever to get service. They should def add 1 more bartender on busy nights.",1
2945,"The food was simply amazing, meatballs, truffle garlic bread and chicken Parmesan are my favorites, but i have never had anything i didn’t enjoy.  The service is outstanding, our waiter Johnny was friendly, efficient and attentive.  Save room for the desserts, so delicious, especially the bomboloni donuts, so delicious.",1
2946,"Hot take: Benjamin is the best server in Chicago, bar none. Honestly, such a great experience - we had a group of 5 and he helped us navigate the menu with allergies and dietary preferences, pointed out the items not to miss, and made some killer cocktails. We are not worthy.

Food was delicious. Don’t sleep on the meatballs, they’re amazing. Chicken parm was gluten free (!!!) and an enormous portion. The short rib pasta got rave reviews from others at the table, as did the ravioli and the steak.

But mostly, come here for Benjamin. The great food is a bonus.",1
2947,What do you want me to tell you about the number one place in Chicago that's called RPM Italian one of the best Italian restaurants I've got to eat I ordered so much food it was absolutely amazing from appetizer to dessert to find alcohol beverages a glass of wine and yes even a Long Island you guys went first place Ambience Style quality of food you guys received the highest in Stars if I could give you a sixth you would deserve it will definitely come back here and bring a ton of friends,1
2948,Place is nice service was also fast and friendly. The food well my steak was bloody in the middle asked for medium well. My spaghetti was hard they didn't cook it long enough and they have no signature drinks all old school drinks with dark liquor. They need more modern cocktails to make me spend more money and time there.,1
2949,"Amazing lemon mousse dessert, that was top notch. The brussel sprouts were also solid. My friends loved their pasta. The waiters wear white jackets and they have to pay for their own dry cleaning or $200 to replace it! I think this restaurant can afford to clean its waiters jackets.",1
2950,"Today we came to Rpm Italian for a nice family / birthday dinner. We started with the meatballs and garlic bread for appetizer. Dipping the garlic bread into the sauce made the bread even more delicious. The main meal was steak, potatoes and brussel  sprouts. The steak was cooked to perfection. Our server Andre was outstanding! Very courteous, friendly and made sure our drinks were full. I highly  recommend this place.",1
2951,"We love RPM Italian - the food is consistently excellent, and the cocktails/wines are as well. Our most recent trip, we were absolutely blown away by the sweet corn agnolotti. Seriously - you’re doing yourself a disservice if you don’t get it!

We were super impressed by Nina G, who served us. She was attentive and friendly, and made us feel right at home on our anniversary! Thank you, Nina!",1
2952,"This is one of my favorite places for dinner. Service is always great, so is the atmosphere! Reasonably priced for the downtown area, this restaurant never disappoints. My overall experience is excellent! Thank you guys for an amazing experience!",1
2953,"My wife and went with another couple last night, 4-21.  We had a recommendation to go here from friends. It did not disappoint. This was overall one of the best meals I have ever had.  We started with the prime meatballs, and truffle oil garlic bread. Everyone got a full meatball and it just melted in your mouth. The bread had a healthy garlic flavor without being too much.  Then we split Ricotta Cavateli, and Chicken Parm as mains along with brussel sprouts and whipped potatoes. All were fantastic.  So much flavor in all of them.  We then finished off with lemon semifreddo and bomboloni.  Since it was our friends bday they brought mini vanilla gelato, and raspberry sorbets.",1
2954,"Everything on the menu at RPM Italian is delicious!
You have to get the garlic bread and my favorite is the giant Spaghetti Meatball. That is the best meatball I’ve ever had in my life
Wine menu is also very extensive with good range in prices",1
2955,Had some bruschetta and grilled prawns but unfortunately didn't eat due to a panic attack mid dinner. We Sat at the bar area in the corner by the computer on Thursday 9/29 night and the women working there had a white shirt and unfortunately can't recall her name.  Reason for my post is the waitress was a rock star she jumped in to action and brought me hot tea and assured me she was available with anything I need to make my stay more comfortable.  She checked on me periodically and definitely made a huge impact on getting my senses back and enjoying the rest of my night.  I hope Managers figure out who she was and give praise for her excellent customer service.,1
2956,"We went there for my daughter's graduation dinner. Our server, Jessica was on it! Stellar customer service. Her menu knowledge was impeccable. She made my daughter feel very special on her special day. Thank You Jessica!",1
2957,"Tonight was probably my 20th time at RPM Italian in Chicago.  I’m a big fan of all of the RPM restaurants, but tonight was undoubtedly the best service we have ever had. Nate was extremely attentive without being overbearing. His knowledge of the menu seemed genuine and not over rehearsed. He was charming, friendly and above all honest. His recommendations were top notch. Probably my favorite RPM experience to date.",1
2958,"We have been wanting to visit RPM Italian since it opened but it just never was in the cards. We came to Chicago this weekend for our 9 year wedding anniversary and I made reservations to finally give this place a shot. We were a little nervous because we had our one year old and read some reviews that kids really aren't welcome. I am glad to say we had the complete opposite experience, our waitress Jackie was over the top amazing not only to us but to our sweet little girl, making it an experience for everyone. She brought out complimentary champagne and little gelato cones which made the experience special and the food was over the top amazing. My wife had the lobster ravioli and if she had room I'm sure would of had another plate of them, we also had the truffle garlic bread which was very tasty. We will definitely be back, don't hesitate to give this little gem a try.",1
2959,"Delicious food, great ambience and friendly staff. I loved their suggestions on cocktails and desserts. Focaccia was excellent too.

Only one con - Little cramped up spaces.",1
2960,"We celebrated our wedding anniversary together here in STYLE. IT'S okay to dress up, as the attentive servers are in nice sportscoats and ties. The food is mostly from  Bill and Guiliana family recipes: deliciously special. The crowd was lovely and lively. We had a great meal - getting in a half hour before our reserved time -  for a good price.",1
2961,"Absolutely loved this place. Great ambience. Seats could have been spaced out a little bit more. There was some seat rubbing with the party behind us.
Tartare and meatball appetizers were really tasty. Chicken parmesan was superb, but with two fillets plan to have a doggy pack.
Truly recommend worthy.",1
2962,Great service and all of our food was delicious!,1
2963,"Came here in a group of 4 for a birthday dinner on a Monday night. We were not seated for a full hour after our reservation time. Instead of being met with apologies, the staff at this restaurant simply told us that “this is a popular restaurant” and that we should expect it. By the time we sat down, service was slow and our food came out cold. We almost left at several points during the experience. Will not be coming back.",0
2964,Lovely experience and atmosphere. All food was very good but my chicken leg wasn't cooked. It was dealt with quickly and handled professionally. It wouldn't stop me dining here again...,1
2965,"The exquisite dry aged Bistecca Fiorentina gets a 5*, but it was also priced accordingly. It had a very unique texture with completely broken down fibers and very tender cuts, and came with delicious soft roasted garlic, although the pickled peppers didn't seem to fit. Otherwise, the Bufala and Lobster shouldn't be on the menu. The cheese was weirdly sour, almost sparkling in my mouth with every bite. The lobster felt like it was just thawed. We loved the whipped ricotta with honey and the very generous Focaccia, but it felt like something we could have literally whipped up at home. The pastas are tapas style and priced accordingly as well, but I loved my Bucatini even though both fresh pastas we got don't hold a candle to Torchio's. For the dessert, we got the Tiramisu which was OK but a bit too big so keep in mind it's enough for two. My Budino looked better than it tasted. Looks like the Gelato were better options than both. Service was slow with plenty of waiting between the different courses. The place has a very exciting and stimulating vibe, with well balanced music that is loud enough to overwhelm neighboring conversations, while making your own quite audible. We went on a Saturday evening and the place was so crowded that we had to wait 10 minutes past our reservation time, as did others.",1
2966,"My Family celebrated my Birthday, and we are long term patrons. They have never failed to satisfying! The cuisine is exceptional, as is the service. Don't miss out!",1
2967,"A great spot for a date night! The atmosphere is great and the menu is elevated from what we normally gravitate towards. Always on my list when I visit Chicago, RPM is a modern classic.",1
2968,"Always a place to visit. They do accept walk ins, but you have to sit at the bar. Service is always great. The atmosphere is lively with good music.

Everything on the menu is tasty. Never had a bad dish. Go to dishes are:

1. Ricotta and honey with bread. Absolutely amazing. House made ricotta and foccacia bread
2. Carbonara is one of the best I've had
3. Short rib parpadelle
4. Shaved Brussel sprouts salad is delicious and healthy.

Can't go wrong with any pasta dish.",1
2969,"I must have caught the cavatelli on a bad night because we ended up sending it back. It tasted like someone added way too much oregano, we couldn't taste anything else. Everything else we ordered was fantastic and our server was great!",1
2970,"Loved the truffle garlic bread and spaghetti & meatball.  Portions are on the smaller size, but still filling. Did not like the Caesar salad- doesn’t seem like the traditional anchovy/parm dressing.",1
2971,"Always so incredibly solid. It is reliable and that is why its always busy. On the cheaper side, which is nice to change when you have been in Vegas for a week. It is a quiet joint as well.",1
2972,"Great atmosphere and delicious food.
Their signature pasta was yummy, truffle risotto, branzino fish, truffle bread, steak all were delicious plates. Service was excellent.",1
2973,"Went for my birthday dinner. amazing food, good ambience and excellent service. We ordered Truffle garlic bread, king crab bruschetta and octopus for appetizer , Squind ink pasta and lobster fra diavolo  for entree.  The restaurant surprised us with a complimentary cake.",1
2974,"We had a great time celebrating a birthday at RPM Italian!  Our waiter Quinn was very accommodating and helpful in guiding our culinary tour.  The rich, bold flavors were quite memorable causing us to plan for the next visit already.  Prices were reasonable and portions were just right.  Great ambiance and perfect lighting for conversation or photos. Great experience from start to finish.  Highly recommended!",1
2975,"Best Italian meal I've had in a while. Portions smaller, but enough. Price is reasonable for the ambience.",1
2976,This is hands down my favorite restaurant! Every time I’m in Chicago I go here. The carbonara is amazing! I highly recommend! The wait staff is always friendly and the food is beyond delicious! Dessert is amazing as well!,1
2977,"Great service in a swanky setting.

We rolled deep into the pasta section after starting on a few appetisers.

The seasonal butternut squash casconeli was my favourite with the carbonara coming close second.

Don’t skip dessert either!",1
2978,It's all about the details and of course the food. RPM Italian has gone beyond the threshold of excellence and service. The decor is super modern but simple and appealing. I was happy and surprised at how good the bgm music was. I caught myself getting in the groove and tapping my foot as I enjoyed an amazing appetizer of calamari. It was super fresh and delicious. I ordered an amazing old fashioned that was of superior quality that I was compelled to order another before finishing the first. Since it was our first visit we went pretty basic. Chicken parmigiana and spaghetti and meatball. Needless to say the food was delightfully exceptional very tasteful and clearly fresh and made to order. This place is mandatory for any person that seriously loves Italian food.,1
2979,"Great meal. The food and service were fantastic. It’s attached to a hotel; so you’ll see some patrons dressed for an evening out and others dressed for an evening in.

Of all the dishes, the pastas stood out. The cavatelli was outstanding. Can’t wait to go back.",1
2980,"My wife and I could not have been happier with our experience at RPM Italian! Friends had highly recommended the restaurant and were going in with high hopes that were not disappointed!

Elisabeth was kind enough to go out of her way to get us taken care of  (we are expecting!) and Bob was a great server.

The people were amazing & the food and drinks stole the show! Bob advised we order a few portions and share everything and it was a great tip. For the two of us, the 10oz steak special and two pasta dishes, plus a bread dish, was a perfect amount of food.

My wife enjoyed a few delicious mocktails while I enjoyed a house made cocktail followed by a pour of one of the finest whiskeys ever created, George T. Stagg.

Amazing food & drink combined with top notch people help create the perfect ambience for us and we greatly enjoyed our meal. We look forward to meals at other RPM restaurants in the future!",1
2981,"Came back for a Tuesday Dinner and RPM Italian did not disappoint. Replayed the hits and dove into some amazing cheesecake!

Nice Sunday afternoon lunch. Party of 3 shared the meatballs (came out after the warm octopus (sp good went too fast to pjoto) and zucchini (almost missed a photo) starters amd then split bun up yhe squid ink and short rib pasta dishes. Oh and the Choclate tora!!!",1
2982,The two stars was for the service waiter was very good and attentive I would have given 5 stars if the managers had stepped up hair in my salad and cold meatballs we barely eat both and nobody came to talk to us about the mistakes other than that it was a good experience I wouldn’t eat there again,0
2983,First time to have dined in this restaurant. Ambience was very pleasant. Foods looks so appetizing from other tables. Loved the RPM negroni.  Didn't have much selections for vegans. But the server(Robert) was very helpful in putting up a plate for me. And I enjoyed it. Will definitely comeback.,1
2984,"Not worth the wait or money. I can go to a cheerier steak house and get better quality food.

Way overpriced",0
2985,"I had a wonderful time here! The food was excellent! Our waitress collaborated with me in making this a memorable occasion, given that I just proposed to my girlfriend, now fiancée, after dinner just a couple days ago! I appreciate all of the love and greetings we received while we were there! What a beautiful restaurant for such an occasion!",1
2986,"It was a good experience but I wouldn’t say it was incredible. The service was good, we didn’t have to wait for too long for food. We ordered a few different dishes, lobster pasta, beef carpaccio, flat bread with mushrooms which was very good and a few other pastas. The restaurant was very busy so I would recommend making a reservation.",1
2987,"Exceptional in every aspect. One of the best cocktails in the city. Well balance of alcohol and mix. Food was best as well. Prime Meatballs, pizza, roasted chicken or even dessert all excellent. Services are excellent as well.",1
2988,The place atmosphere is great! But food is bad… I had some spicy hot (it was too spicy unexpected) chicken with barely cooked sauce…service was ok…never comming back…,0
2989,Incredible food! The bar atmosphere was great so we decided to sit on the bar side instead of waiting an hour for a table in the restaurant side. Their cocktails were fantastic and our waiter mentioned the menu items were large enough to share so we ended up ordering a little bit of everything. The food was insanely delicious!,1
2990,"Food was good, not memorable.  Service left a lot to be desired.  Sad to say that we probably won’t be back.  Culture feels bad here…",1
2991,Dependable very good modern Italian. The spicy king crab pasta is one of my favorite dishes in the city.,1
2992,"This is a very classy place. Perfect for a date! The food is out of this world. We tried lobster caprese, stuffed peppers, wood roasted octopus and rosemary focaccia to start with and were blown away by how everything was just absolutely perfectly done with spot on flavor. Our server was wonderful and had excellent recommendations for food and drinks. For our main course, we decided to split 3 pasta dishes (carbonara, spicy king crab and butternut squash agnolotti), bone-in ribeye and crispy brussels sprouts between the four of us, and that was an excellent choice as we got to try different flavors and they were all exquisite. You HAVE to try the desserts here, especially hazelnut tartufo. Wonderful place, brilliant service, cozy ambience and great food and drinks.",1
2993,Were there to celebrate a 21st birthday. The menu was great. We had excellent service.  We loved our food! Social distancing in force. Felt very safe. Enjoyed our dinner. Highly recommend.,1
2994,"One of my absolute favorites in Chicago. The atmosphere is great - always busy, but definitely a hip spot to be! I usually visit RPM while on business travel, however, during a visit to Chicago with my husband, we enjoyed a spectacular date night beginning at RPM Italian. The ambiance is definitely inviting! The service always exceeds my expectations. The wait staff is very attentive.

The food never disappoints. I have tried many different dishes from artisanal breads and cheeses, steak, salmon, and their incredible spaghetti! You would not think of RPM for salmon and mash potato, but, it's probably some of the best salmon I have had! Their standard is medium rare and it is basted with a pesto pistachio sauce - amazing! For appetizers, I highly recommend the ricotta cheese and bread. The bread is spectacular and the homemade ricotta is mouth watering! The cocktails are wonderful and they have a great selection of wines! Highly recommended!",1
2995,"First time in Chicago and this was the place we ate on our last night there. Excellent food, and even better service. Should have reviewed this while it was fresh in my mind, as I can't remember our waiter's name now, but he was excellent. Food was really good. The pasta portion I got was average, but the waiter made that known upfront, so it was no big deal. I sampled a few appetizers,  along with the main dish, and that was plenty of food for my wife and I.  The summer time Old Fashioned was great as well.",1
2996,"We really enjoyed the ambiance here. We came for lunch and as we sit, we feel like we are in a lounge with their nice white leather chairs and sofas, and cool lounge music.  I can tell it would be a good spot for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights...a nice place to invite your trendy friends.  Food was good too, and staff was very friendly (our server was Mary)",1
2997,"Appetizers, salad, and main entrees were delicious. Personally enjoyed the chicken parmigiana. Waitress and waiter were exceptional with a party of six from out of town.  A must visit when in town but be sure to make a reservation a few weeks in advance seating fills up quickly.",1
2998,Delicious Italian. Lots of nice appetizer options. Spicy King Crab with squid ink spaghetti and Eggplant Parm were great. Pistachio Gelato was possibly the best gelato I’ve had anywhere.,1
2999,"I love this place, but my last visit here we were seated 30 minutes after our reservation and the food tasted rushed. Otherwise a great restaurant.",1
3000,Incredible and knowledgeable bar staff know what the good whiskeys are. Props to the bar manager for stocking a decent selection and ensuring that the bartenders know their stuff.,1
3001,"November 2018
Came back almost a year later, and the food was still good. I didn't get the truffle risotto this time but they had that as a feature, with white truffles. They were super busy but luckily I was still able to get a table. I would say this place is only expensive if you order drinks, apps, etc. The homemade pasta dishes are all under $20. So you can still enjoy a good meal without spending a ton.

January 2018
Had our new year's dinner here and it was really good. New Year so we figured we would splurge. We were going to come here with a reservation before the new year but plans changed so we sat at the bar when we came here on the new year. I had the black truffle risotto which was a feature for the night. The brussel sprouts was amazing, so crispy. Definitely need to try the hazelnut tartufo, looks like a giant Ferrero Rocher. Overall experience I would definitely come back again!",1
3002,"We have the waygu carpaccio, fried olives, 4 pasta dishes and two dessert among the 3 of us. Portion size is definitely on the small side and price on the high end.  Everything tasted delicious abd service was excellent.  We will be back.",1
3003,An amazing Italian place. I love how the restaurant is set up as 3 courses and the portion sizes are perfect to share. Obviously it's not your typical American Italian place so do not go expecting maggianos or Olive garden. Our food was cooked perfectly and our server was fantastic. Every question I had about ingredients/menu were know on the spot. They even gave us a free glass of processco bc it was our one year wedding anniversary. We will be coming back for sure.,1
3004,Food and service were excellent! The cremini mushroom pizette and the black truffle beef tartare were to DIE for! Short rib ragu was delicious as well.,1
3005,"The food was subpar.  The housemade pasta was unforgivable.  The apps didn't do it.  Apart from great service, this was a bomb!",0
3006,Wow! I’ve been waiting a while to try this place. I’ve heard great things and it definitely lived up to the hype. We arrived around 5pm. There was no wait and we sat in the bar area. It was very busy but we received great service from Maurene. She checked in with us consistently. Food was very delicious! I wish I could’ve tried everything on the menu. Definitely recommend!,1
3007,"Came here on the last night before all restaurants closed for two weeks to support the local staff. We were not disappointed! Started with the Frito Misto and a bottle of red, then had the carbonara with mushrooms. Finished it off with a dessert which was bomb. If you come you have to get the carbonara, noodles are perfect.",1
3008,"My friend & I went in on a Friday night for dinner. It was our first time there. The atmosphere was great. We loved the low lighting! Our server Jerry was awesome! He put up with us telling him he looked like a combination of Steph Curry and Jesse Williams from Grey’s Anatomy. Anyway, the food and drinks were fantastic & we can’t wait to go back!",1
3009,"Always a winner experience. The garlic truffle bread and the meat balls are a must have.
Service impeccable",1
3010,"Our waiter was great, but we just weren’t overwhelmingly impressed. They do have an entire gluten free menu, which is why we chose to go there. The best bites of the night we’re the meatballs and fried olives. The beef tartare needed salt and the risotto was very mushroomy.",1
3011,Not nearly as good as RPM Steak. Dishes varied in terms of how satisfied our party was. Better than Maggianos but there is much better Italian in Chicago. It was freezing inside of the restaurant and they couldn't seem to address it. Mixed bag. Good not great. Our server was extremely nice. Just wish the food was up to some of the other Lettuce fine dining experiences.,1
3012,"Amazing food, lovely ambiance. Went here for dinner with my colleagues and all seven of us loved it. Prime beef meatballs and house made pasta were highlights. If you have a sweet tooth, get the Italian donuts--they melt in your mouth!",1
3013,"Without a doubt one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had for a long time.

To put some meat on the bone:

- We made a booking, but because they overbook the restaurant on purpose, we ended up waiting 45 minutes in the lobby along with about 50 other people (see photos).  Unless you are willing to wait around, or happen to be walking in off the street, I wouldn't bother going.

After waiting 45 minutes, you would hope that the meal would be worth it, but unfortunately I cannot say as much:

- My salad starter was coated in enough salt to give me high blood pressure.  Clearly the chef(s) is not in the habit of tasting the food before sending it out.

- In an Italian place one would assume that you would get great 'secondi', right?  A couple of decent bowls of pasta and you're in business, but even that was apparently too much to ask.

- My other half's spaghetti was like eating strands of inpenetrable string, and my cavaletti were thick and dough-y, with an uninspired sauce.

-  My better judgement should have told me to stop at the mains, but, being a glutton for punishment, I had to insult my palate with dessert as well.

I could go on and on, and you likely don't want to hear me whinging ad nauseum about the service and the mediocre food, but my whole-hearted advice would be to avoid RPM and try anywhere else.",0
3014,Excellent balance of the briny squid ink al-dente pasta in a spicy sauce with king crab.  Arguably best italian in all of Chicago.,1
3015,"Appetizers were great. Main courses were decent. However, for the prices and quality of the restaurant, the service needs to be better. For example, the sever handed me my heavy dish of veal ossobuco from halfway across an 8 top table for me to place in front of me myself!!! That should never happen in any restaurant, let alone an RPM restaurant. Also took forever to get our drinks after placing a drink order. Service definitely needs to be buttoned up.",1
3016,"Overall, an excellent experience with RPM Italian. Everything we ate was delicious and our waiter was great. Loved the general ambience and everyone working there seemed to know to do their job well.

Would highly recommend making a stop here if you’re in the area.",1
3017,"We had a reservation for a Tuesday night, the restaurant was still very busy for what I expected would be a slower evening. Even with being busy our server was wonderful and attentive. Food came out fairly quickly and presentation is what you would expect for this caliber of restaurant. The only thing I would mention is that the pasta portion sizes are much smaller than a typical italian restaurant so definitely order some bread and appetizers. They're all delicious anyway.",1
3018,"It's was truly amazing! The music, staff, and speed at which I received my food was excellent. My water cup was never hit the bottom on top of that. Definitely deserves the 5 star rating!",1
3019,Great Italian restaurant with authentic food.  Staff is so nice and well trained.  Love LEYE restaurants.,1
3020,We always visit this place when we go to Chicago! Great food and atmosphere!,1
3021,For a red sauce joint it's not bad. I would of liked more pesto and white sauce options though.  The decor and matches are nice though!,1
3022,"This is a wonderful restaurant a very special Chicago experience. Nothing but he very, very best of what Chicago has to offer. Almost everything is imported from Italy and local farmers. Impressive decor, exceptional service, best cheese plates and cuts of meat - balanced with sides, starters and desserts.
Every time is wonderful and memorable dining Italian experience. #rpmitalian #chicagorestaurants",1
3023,"As a resident in Hyde Park, I was so envious to  experience this classy and tasty restaurant in this town. This is the best Italian ristorante I’ve ever been in Chicago so far. Risotto, Bolognese pasta, caesar salad, lobster something...man every bit of it was fresh and delicious. I would definitely want to visit this place again.",1
3024,"Had an excellent dining experience. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, the ambiance was vibrant. It was a Friday evening, so it was a busy night and the staff was hustling. I really enjoyed my steak dinner, the appetizers and the cocktails were superb, the desserts were a nice finishing touch to the evening. I definitely will return  to try a different plate and a few more cocktails. I hope you enjoy your visit.",1
3025,"A nice ambiance, great staff, delicious meals, excellent portions, service top notch, an amazing variety of selection to choose from.",1
3026,"My husband and I went there for our 1 year wedding anniversary and we were pretty disappointed with their service.  Once we got seated, we waited over 20 mins for our server to come to our table.  While we were waiting,  Jackie (server), who wasn't our server noticed that we have been waiting for a while came to our table and apologized for the delay that our server was going to come to our table shortly.  We were very impressed with Jackie and she's the only reason why I am rating this place 3 stars at least. Thanks Jackie.

Long story short, our server wasn't very friendly and we don't think we will go back to this place.",1
3027,"Our last meal for the weekend was at RPM first and foremost. Our server Katie was phenomenal. She was totally awesome. . Give her a raise.  I judge a menu by how many times I'd want to try something new. And I would would try everything on this menu.  Everything was delicious,  drinks apps,  my lobster, fra Diavola, just a fantastic dining experience.  It does take some time to get a reservation so if you're going to go. Book early.  You won't be disappointed.",1
3028,Food was absolutely incredible. The ambiance and experience were great. I'd definitely go back!,1
3029,Appetizers are great! Food is fresh and delicious.  Good customer service.,1
3030,"Very upsetting.  There are enough Italian restaurants in chicago that this one out not to exist. 200 dollars for lunch when the salad was no better than fast food, the carbonara was bland and they had to asked for parmesan and the meatballs were average by vapanios standards.  The restaurant week lunch was 48 versus 34.  It was inexcusable.",0
3031,Ordered online. Don’t understand why shrimp scampi was placed in a tomato based sauce… the steak was flavorful but chewy.,1
3032,"I order RPM Italian every time I come to Chicago with no issues.  This time, I ordered the Chicken Vesuvio al Forno and my chicken was very overcooked and the sauce was bland. My husband contacted RPM and was told we would have to contact Door Dash for a refund.  I did not order through Door Dash nor was it their fault the food was prepared incorrectly. It was still warm when we received it.  He explained this to the Lady on the phone, then to the manager, who again said we would have to contact door dash.  After talking a little more, the manager said they could remake the dish, or refund our credit card.  My husband opted for the refund and that was it.  About 10 minutes later we receive a phone call from Door Dash stating they would credit our Door Dash account.  My husband explained to him that we do not have an account so that will not work.  He said he would contact the restaurant and we did not hear anything after that.  That was Saturday night, this morning I had a refund from Door Dash on my credit card for $9.43.  I paid $31.00 plus tax, plus some other fees for the chicken dish.  This is very unacceptable, and I am shocked at how this was handled.",0
3033,"We had an excellent time here. Prices are a bit steep for our tastes, but it is the City. Our server was very nice and gave us a free appetizer and dessert. We also just barely squeezed in a few drinks and another app at happy hour pricing, so in the end it was very affordable. Food and mixed cocktails were excellent",1
3034,The food here was absolutely stellar but what really made this place special was our server. Kevin was the most amazing server I have ever had. He is so knowledgeable of the menu and SO on top of it. We had a dairy allergy at the table and they accommodated her better than ever. I would come back to this restaurant to solely see Kevin again.,1
3035,"We dined here Christmas Eve and had the Feast of 7 fishes menu.  Our reservation was at 10pm and even though the dining room was still very full we were fine with sitting in the large bar area at a table away from everyone with a nice perch to people watch.  Our waiter ""Kevin"" was amazing throughout..was prompt with our drinks and explained the menu and the dishes very well.  Only issue which is minor would be for a server working in the bar area who did not know the wine profiles and had to ask someone about the apertifs after dinner at a fine dining establishment such as RPM.  Every dish was excellent one after the other..i doubt my pictures will load :-( but started with antipasti of a raw oyster and a couple crudos a fish and then a dish of scallop crudo, then had the octopus salad, spaghetti with vongole, i tried my partners risotto with truffle, then had the branzino and he had the lobster.Dinner all in all such a treat and at 85$ plus the wine pairing it was quite affordable for the amount and the quality of the food.",1
3036,Phenomenal dinner. Didn’t have a reservation but found a table in the bar easily. Burrata was the best I’ve ever had and the pastas were amazing- perfectly cooked pasta and great flavors. Service was spectacular and professional. Highly recommend going in you’re in Chicago,1
3037,Great Good!!!! And the service from the waiter was excellent!!!! The only downfall was they ran out of chicken parmesan,1
3038,"We did the sommelier experience last night. WOW!! Everything was amazing and the wine pairings were fabulous. Isabella, the sommelier was very knowledgeable and picked some amazing wines. It is so worth the cost. Great experience for a special occasion or wine and food lovers.",1
3039,"Never got to eat, just had a drink at the bar. Great service, good drinks.",1
3040,Busy Wednesday evening so we ate at the bar. Service was great. Loved the tomatoes. The bolognese was rich and yummy with shredded short ribs. Salmon was cooked amazing well but needed a bit of salt.,1
3041,"Our server, Jerry, was phenomenal. He made up for the lackluster entrées and appetizers. Isabella, the sommelier, is A+. Absolutely brilliant and added a dimension of fun to our evening. The wagyu tartare came out frozen, which was concerning for obvious reasons. The cavetelli sauce was deeply flavorful yet the pasta was over cooked at best. Decor and overall vibe is antiquated. 5 stars for Jerry and Isabella. The management did not attempt to remedy our appetizers which was disappointing.",1
3042,Perfect spot to try a wide variety. Small 4oz pasta plates allow you to order 3-4 at a time to try out more than just one thing.  Not cheap but also very cheap for downtown Chicago.  $100ish for 6 dishes of pasta.,1
3043,"Second visit was much better than the first. Food was great, love the homemade pasta. Chic surroundings. Friendly service.",1
3044,"Food is great, service the flawless! Taking off a star for waiting to get our table, etc. It’s really busy, so feels like a production line before you get into the dining room.",1
3045,Just pricey but not that great.  The pistachio dessert was not good at all.  The two pasta was just ok. One pasta was super salty:( Burrata was awesome though,1
3046,very popular hyped restaurant in river north. Food quality warrants the reputation. Service is sufficient. A little overpriced and over hyped in my opinion but nonetheless a very nice experience and great place to bring visitors.,1
3047,"This is a great place that is very romantic if you care to bring a date.  If not, it's also appropriate for enjoying a great meal with friends, family (small party) and colleagues.  Here, there is the right balance in the atmosphere.  My personal must try, is the Black Truffle Gnocchi.  This item is not traditionally on the menu, its usually a special offering; however, if you can make it on a day and time when its available, I encourage you as a must try!  The dish is not served in a large portion, so I would recommend it for an appetizer or if you do order as your entree, you will possibly need more food afterwards.  A word of caution, this dish is too good to share!  Also, please try to order it ASAP, because they run out fast, I think everyone is on to this simply wonderful dish.  Good luck, I LOVE this place too much.  So much I am always willing to go in alone.",1
3048,"Sat in the bar but our group loved everything and the team at RPM was accommodating.
Bartenders weren’t very friendly but it was the end of a long busy night.",1
3049,"Excellent food! I love their mushroom pizzette and their pastas are great. I have never had a tartufo before, and man, I have been missing out. It's become my favorite dessert!!",1
3050,A great place to have authentic Italian cuisine. I ordered the crispy roasted chicken and it was amazing. Will definitely come back here when I'm in Chicago again.,1
3051,"We went for happy hour/dinner a few times - Great ambiance, the staff are incredibly friendly, and food / drinks are delicious!",1
3052,The food was incredible.  The atmosphere was fun and different and is great for a date night.  We really enjoyed our experience here.  Would def come back.,1
3053,"I have been to RPM Italian once before and the food and service was very good.  Decided to return to celebrate my dad's 75th birthday and were not disappointed.  We arrived early and decided to have a glass of wine and their mushroom pizza appetizer.  The pizza was very flavorful and the bartender's suggested Super Tuscan was a good match.  The bartender provided quick service and piqued my wife's decision to have spicy tequila and blood orange Paloma.  Dinner was equally good food and very good service.  The table shared the wood grilled octopus, burrata, and beef carpaccio.  Dinner entrees included a veal chop for dad, filet mignon for sister, short rib pasta for mom, pork and beef cavatelli for wife, and the carbonara with prosciutto for me.  All were very good with the steaks grilled perfectly simple.  The pasta dishes are perfect sized if you already had some appetizers and bread or not very hungry.  We will definitely be back.",1
3054,Make reservation ahead. But they have some flexibility for bar sitting. Food was really good. Garlic truffle bread was amazing.Great place to hang out on Friday night,1
3055,First time here and it was excellent. It was crowded but the service was great. The Old Fashion with the extra cherry was great!!,1
3056,"Loved this place! Food was better than I thought! Great portions, tasty food, great price, great staff and great music!",1
3057,"Such an amazing place. My wife and I had plans to go to rpm steak the following night which we did, but on a whim I decided for us to go to rpm Italian   for dinner. Everything was delicious and the garlic truffle bread was too die for. As we were finishing up dinner my wife notices Giuliana walk out from the back followed by Bill. My wife was shocked as she is such a big fan. She did not want to go up to them and say hi, so as a good husband would I went up to Giuliana and asked if she would take a pic with my wife. She happily did and was extremely nice about it. Bill even took my phone and snapped a picture. It was an unforgettable night and experience and I have to thank Bill and Giuliana for being so gracious.  We will definitely try your D.C. restaurant as well. Your Maryland fans.",1
3058,"The food was off the hook! The fried olives and beef tartar at the beginning were delicious. Their rum cocktail took me back to the beaches of Puerto Rico, and the pastas lived up to the hype for the price to quality ratio. Our server surprised us with these awesome little ice cream cones not on the menu, and those donuts at the end for the table practically melt in your mouth. Looking forward to hopefully working for LEYE in the future because they never disappoint !",1
3059,"My wife and I went to RPM Italian for Valentine's day. We had been to the restaurant a few times in the past and returned due to their service and food quality. This experience didn't disappoint. We had an excellent waitress that helped with recommendations as we tried to decide on appetizers and wine. There was a little hiccup with the food taking longer than expected due to an issue in the kitchen but the waitress helped get it resolved and gave us some treats to thank us for our patience. The ambiance in the restaurant is so nice it didn't bother us to spend more time in the restaurant and have a couple extra drinks.

Highly Recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Chicago",1
3060,"From start to finish, this was a memorable experience. Magnificent service, impressive wine menu, and delicious food. The ambiance was perfect. I look forward to returning.",1
3061,"Truly a treat and overall great experience! Food was fresh and phenomenal. Pasta was cooked perfectly. Chicken parm was a larger portion for two with a small side of spaghetti. Even better was the service. Cole was our waiter and he was extremely attentive, friendly and made our group feel comfortable and welcome! Service is definitely a priority at all RPM restaurants. They have a visible presence and it accounts for a flawless dinner. Prices are comparable with other high end Italian spots in River North, but well worth the quality of food. For drinks, go with the old fashion with the “RPM” Ice cube or the Spritz and Giggles where you can’t go wrong with raspberry, vodka and Prosecco. Will absolutely be back again!",1
3062,"Service was slow, food portions were very small.. ordered a $18 pizza, that was about 3x3… food overall tasted decent.",0
3063,"Best ever. Best food , best drinks, best service, best atmosphere. Went here with hubby to celebrate our 2 year engagement anniversary because he proposed here. And to our surprise the wait staff brought us a surprise Gelato dessert!",1
3064,This place is absolutely incredible! The food was outstanding and the service was a cut above what you would ever expect at a nice restaurant. I highly recommend the pistachio gelato and the truffles bread.,1
3065,"Im not a seafood lover but i liked their food, the atmosphere is so nice! They seated us by the window so it was a little chill. However its a nice place.",1
3066,"Every meal I’ve had at RPM has been phenomenal. My personal favorite is the Spicy King Crab pasta. Drinks are good, service is great, and I love bringing out of towners here!",1
3067,"Everything was delicious,  I celebrated my bday and they brought me very cool ice cream, and didn't draw any attention like other places.",1
3068,"Server Jackie M, was amazing and knowledgeable. Top notch service and food was delicious. Ambiance was warm and ask for Jackie, you won't be disappointed.",1
3069,"Been coming here for a few years for special occasions. Always excellent. Every server is top notch, the meals are always well paced, never rushed. Don't think I've ever been disappointed with anything I've ordered. Highly recommend the carbonara, chicken parmesan, beef tartare, and meatballs.",1
3070,RPM did not disappoint. Had the spicy king crab pasta. One of the best pasta dishes I had in a long time. I was just in Rome and I would say this pasta might be a tad better than some expensive pasta dinners I had in Italy.,1
3071,Great food and nice atmosphere! Everything was on point and met expectations.,1
3072,"Great place to enjoy dinner with a group of friends. Lively atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff, polished service. I was blown away by how beautifully crisp and well seasoned the fried zucchini was, and the bucatini pomodoro had a wonderful rich flavor and perfect texture. The menu doesn't include allergen info but I found the server very well informed and helpful.",1
3073,Our second visit to this restaurant was for mothers day. The special menu was great. Really too much food. Drink specials were outstanding. Pictured here is the amazing ice cream dessert we shared. Food never disappoints. A bit pricey and a tad weak on wait service but overall a delicious experience.,1
3074,"May be the best Italian joint outside of Italy!!   It is a fantastic scene, with top drawer cuisine, an outstanding bar and prices that are shockingly reasonable for downtown Chicago.
Their mixologist behind the bar worked his mojo on the BEST Old Fashion I’ve had the pleasure to imbibe.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place.",1
3075,"Garlic bread was great, pasta serve was abit small but good flavour even known abit under cooked, dessert was amazing",1
3076,"Great food. The Eggplant parmesan is one of the best dishes I've ever had. Apps and desserts are to die for. Dre was our server this time and was attentive, super friendly, and very knowledgeable. The sommelier took extra time with our group tonight as well. Will continue to return!",1
3077,Great restaurant.  One the best Italian restaurants I've had the pleasure of eating in. I recommend the Lobster Fra Diavolo. It's like lobster spaghetti and it's awesome!,1
3078,"Food excellent. Service horrible. Celebrated my wife’s birthday and you’d think it was a dinner for a funeral. Server had no professionalism, very blah, never came back to check. I almost got up to get a refill. Not what we thought it would be compared to RPM steak where they bring out the giant cotton candy with crown and candle and make you feel good right before that bill comes. Here was hurry up and leave they sat us in the back tucked away in the dark depressing area. Why couldn’t we sit in the front part that felt more Swanky and Alive? This was 4PM and not many people inside. Yes we had reservations. Another example of how upscale industries miss the mark whether with stereotyping or bad service. I recommend the meatballs and chicken Parmesan btw.",0
3079,The service and food was wonderful. They definitely had one of the best pasta dishes i have tried in Chicago and their cocktails were made excellently!,1
3080,One of my go-to Italian restaurants for a fantastic atmosphere and delicious food. Start the evening with a unique cocktail; M was my favorite this evening. The veal parmesan with alfredo.,1
3081,Phenomenal food and great experience. Everything we tried was just delicious!,1
3082,Great food but shouldn’t have switch to Resy.. app is so complicated and hard to book anything,1
3083,"Amazing service and excellent food.  Have eaten pre Covid and now in the tents when its 30 degrees and we were comfortably warm.  Highly recommend, especially the spicey crab and squid ink pasta.",1
3084,Absolutely amazing! The food and desserts are so delicious. The staff member so nice.,1
3085,Pretentious and overpriced. Ignored by our server most of the night. They are not staffed to handle current business climate. Disappointing,0
3086,Outstanding service and food. I would go back in a heartbeat. As I was enjoying my petite fillet I made sure to set down my fork between each bite so that I could enjoy it. Save room for the dessert!,1
3087,I feel for all the hype about RPM I was really let down the food lacked a lot of flavor. Their drinks were really good but maybe I just ordered the wrong item. It was veal with risotto.,1
3088,It was great foods. I really enjoyed.,1
3089,Of course the food and service are incredible but I had to write a review because we got engaged here on my birthday/valentines day!!! I have to give a huge shoutout to our waiter David... he went above and beyond and even secretly recorded the proposal for us. We will cherish the video and pictures from it forever! Thank you so much David and staff! ♥️💍🎉🥂,1
3090,"Absolutely delicious food, especially the bruschetta, which is like a must have.",1
3091,Everything was amazing. Sea bass for 2 was excellent.   The wait was 2 hours but table was available in 40 minutes.,1
3092,"Prices not worth the quality of the food. The small portioned pasta was undercooked in both my own and my friend’s dish (we also heard the couple at the next table comment on this as well). We also had their steak dish, which was ok. The almafi crab bruschetta was light and enjoyable. The best part was actually the dessert. Bomboloni. Looked like beignets and were hot and fresh and delicious. If I revisited it would only be for this. The restaurant is beautiful and our waitress was wonderfully pleasant. I don’t have to go again.",1
3093,"First time in Chicago,  had to see this place. Food and service both amazing. Bill and Giuliana put their hearts into this one. Sooo good.",1
3094,Our favorite restaurant it’s my mom and I’s tradition to come here when she visits. They are very accommodating to vegan and even surprised my mom with some sorbetto for her birthday,1
3095,"Excellent food let down by a mediocre service. Its sad to say, the food is authentic the restaurant decoration is modern, but the service lacks attention towards its customers.",1
3096,"I always have a positive experience when dining here. I had the Maine Lobster Ravioli and my husband had the Wild Mushroom Agnolotti. My initial Ravioli was too hard. The waitress referred to it as “al dente.” I know al dente and this was not. The outings of the Ravioli were completely inedible. She was very responsive and quick to get me a new dish.

My new Ravioli was softer and I simply adored the sauce. I’m in Love with these flavors. They are unlike anything I’ve had before.

My husband’s Agnolotti was so smooth and delightful. The chanterelle was the highlight of his dish and I was impressed with how well every aspect of the dish flowed beautifully.

We just wish the portions were a little larger. He had to order a second dish because it just simply wasn’t enough food for him.",1
3097,"Great food, great location, great service.  Higher end place that didn't disappoint.",1
3098,"Delicious. The restaurant comfortably accommodated our 8-person party. Ambiance was pleasant, appropriately lit, with noise levels neither too loud, nor or too soft. Our server guided us through menu options with great suggestions for the group. Sampled several starters (meatballs and brushetta were especially tasty). Ordered the grilled prawns-nicely prepared.",1
3099,Amazing dinner best food I've had in a long time,1
3100,The service is excellent and the food was delicious. It's a great place to go especially for a special occasion. They give a police discount which is a wonderful way to tell them thank you for your service.,1
3101,Very trendy restaurant with amazing atmosphere and decor!  We got the shredded brussels sprout salad and I got the scallops which were life changing!  I will be going back again for sure!,1
3102,Was bamboozled by Instagram. The pictures online look great but the food was average tasting at best. They have small portions and it’s overpriced for what you are getting. I ordered a drink I saw on their Instagram and they brought me the picture on the right. I didn’t even take a drink yet that’s how it arrived to the table.,0
3103,"Food and service were excellent.  Did not care for atmosphere, too dark and too much like a club.  Not a family place.",1
3104,"Amazing GF options and fabulous wine with stellar service!! So wish we had one in Denver... Hint, hint 😉",1
3105,"Meet James, the most accommodating server I’ve had in a long while. Despite being Italian I can’t eat cheese or milk. At my teams dinner,  James made sure I had the same options as my teammates but without cheese. This meant making a 5th or 6th plate for each of the 4 courses 😭😱🥺. The food was absolutely amazing: I recommend the deep fried zucchini, the mama depandi, and the raspberry sorbet. The only less than best was mint tea: steeping actual mint leaves left a grass like after taste for me.",1
3106,"We visit Chicago, 2-3 times a year and we go to RPM every time. It is sad to say that over the past 2 years the quality of food and menu have dropped every time we visit.
Staff are always great as usual but cannot say the same about food quality. Not as special as it used to be.",0
3107,Great food and service. Pictured here is there a lobster dish and you can always ask for veal parmesan in place of the chicken parmesan. It was delicious,1
3108,"Outstanding drinks at the bar, and shockingly authentic handmade pasta for such a large location! Definitely need to take the time to go to the other locations. I'm sure they are just as fabulous 👌",1
3109,Enjoyed a fantastic ribeye paired with some delicious red wine and some garlic mashed potatoes. We shared the cherry cheesecake to wrap up our meal. Nice ambience and great staff.,1
3110,"Food was amazing and the experience was too till I got my car from their Valet Service. Someone went through my car and stole $300 worth of things. I spoke to management and they were semi helpful. Valet company was in contact with me initially about the claim submitted and now I cant get a call/text back and its been a week. For a high end restaurant and the amount of money I spent that day for my sister's birthday and her friends, I am highly disappointed. Wished I had more support from the restaurant. We loved this place, I used to visit a handful of times a year. Just sucks that one bad experience can ruin everything for you.",0
3111,"It was a good experience! Giving 4 because I would hold this place to a pretty high standard based on the price and prestige. None of the dishes were bad, but I’d also say I wasn’t like WOW to most of the dishes. My main gripe was that everything came out semi-cold which is a pet peeve of mine. Our favorite was the meat balls, my old fashion was awesome, and the whipped ricotta was tasty. Bucatini = 7/10 ; ricotta cavetilli = 9/10 ; lobster risotto = 5/10 ; service = 7/10. They played good tunes and gave us free champagne and a lil desert for free for the date night. Fun time but better restaurants in chi town!",1
3112,"Loved this place, very flavourful food, great service and a classy atmosphere.
We had the 600 day aged prosciutto, the gluten free carbonara (with gf fettuccine which had one of the closest tastings to the real thing I've eaten) and the truffle risotto with shaved black truffles from France.
Jess took care of us and was friendly, helpful and extremely component.
We were even given a complimentary dessert on the house which was one of the best desserts I've ever eaten (like a giant gelato Ferrero Roche ball), delicious!
We wouldn't hesitate to eat there again when next in town.",1
3113,"We came here for our friends birthday...honestly not that impressed. We waited twenty minutes for our drinks. For the price of food, I was expecting a higher quality than what was presented in front of us. Our server didn't even come to check up on us once our food was delivered. Even though, we watched our server check on other tables multiple times. After we finished our entrees we continued to wait for our server to check in on us to present us the check. I expected more from a ""high"" class establishment.",0
3114,"Beautiful room
Great entrees
Home made pasta
Spicy crab  and Anglotti and
Honey ricotta bread are musts",1
3115,"The food tastes ordinary and is super expensive place. Portions too small( really small) and no bread and oil in the beginning and we ordered eggplant Parm and we were charged 21 and the waiter asked for the sides and we said yes ans we were charged 9.95 for a side of red sauce pasta(small portion) and Mushroom rosooto super small portion okay tasting cost me 21 dollars. For this price, the food has to taste stellar and portions decent enough.. Disappointing experience. If you are a vegetarian dont go here !",0
3116,The server was amazing definitely too amazing for RPM Italian. Hint he is a fan of Adidas. The vibes at the host stand is trash they hate there job you can tell. Right at opening she had awful disposition. I just asked her if we could move to a different table  because we needed to talk. She said oh it will be loud come on not 4:15pm.  First of all she looked awful the sweaters at the Host stand are trash. I hate it when someone looks a mess and is rude. The food was fair... Loved my server. It's definitely not on a list to revisit especially when my first impression at the front desk was garbage.,0
3117,"Small food portions but very tasty, which is even better 😁
Old Fashioned is awesome!",1
3118,"Jackie was so amazing and went out of her way to make sure we enjoyed our meal. I wasn’t keen on my
dish and she brought out a new one for me, on her. It made the experience so great. She is also a sweetheart. Ask for her!",1
3119,"We have been to this place every time we come to the city we like it so much.  The food and service has always been fantastic.  The reason for 3 stars this time, the food  was wayyyyy too salty.  Its as if the cook literally put 1 TBL of salt on every dish prior to serving.  Our waiter also did not come back to check for awhile.  I will say they did end up comping 2 dishes.  We will try again, I hope this was a one off.",1
3120,"I am unclear what the purpose of a reservation is if I am required to wait 30 minutes for a table past our  reservation time. This restaurant overbooks tables to the degree that you will have to wait a significant amount of time prior.

Their food remains great - just disagree with their management practices.",1
3121,Was the best of places we ate while visiting Chicago. Their red sauce was really good. Nice flavor and perfect amount of heat,1
3122,"This place is so delicious 😋 😍
Also the service is amazing, by far best service I've had in years",1
3123,The artichoke appetizer is so delicious. We share 2 pasta dishes. The prosciutto tortellini and pork and beef ragout both were different and so good. We sat in bar at a high top table. Service was prompt and very attentive. Finished doff with sorbet and vanilla mini cones. What a great date night. Thank you.,1
3124,"Delicious food,  great service,  good wine advice.  Best short rib bolognese I've ever tasted,  delicious sweet corn agnolotti.  I definitely recommend.",1
3125,"In town for the weekend with friends.It was a pleasure dining here, five star service! Our waitress Nina was amazing with her warm and bubbly personality!
The restaurant is such a beautiful atmosphere the food is so delicious and the wine exquisite and yummy. Thank you!",1
3126,"RPM Italian was amazing when I was hosting a dinner for my brother in laws birthday! We had over 6 people so they accommodated us by having 2 separate tables close by which was great! The staff was so amazing and the food was even better! When I contacted RPM for my event, Chelsea Tobey and Tara Newman helped me out so much! They were in constant communication with me and made everything so special for us! I really appreciated it and will definitely be coming back here!! I recommend it to everyone it’s amazing!",1
3127,"the pasta is scratch, excellent, and cheaper than you would imagine. reservation a day or two ahead seems needed, but it takes 30 seconds via a web app. wait staff is great, orders are fast. expect fancy patrons, but no indication of a formal dress code.",1
3128,"Our first time ar RPM Italian.  The porterhouse steak melted in your mouth. The steak we order was Medium rare, there was so much flavor, nice touch with roasted garlic. We will definitely order the steak again. The chicken was perfect nice crispy on the outside and soft and juicy of the inside.
Our waitress was fantastic,  we will definitely come back again!",1
3129,"Amazing experience, very friendly staff and the food was terrific!",1
3130,"I love the selection of food here. I got Giuliana Prosecco, Caesar wedge and split pea  risotto.",1
3131,"RPM Italian never disappoints. Get several entrees to share, especially the homemade pasta.",1
3132,"I was recommended to dine at rpm by countless of my coworkers. The staff was very friendly from the hostess to our server. We shared the Caesar Wedge which was delicious. I tried the Spicy King Crab Pasta and my partner had the Short Rib Bolognese. Everything was delicious and the drinks were as well. Food was fresh, and the flavors were amazing! Definitely will be back to try them again",1
3133,Great Italian meal in Chicago.,1
3134,Had a great meal at RPM Italian yesterday! Sat in Frankie’s section and he was awesome. Highly recommend getting the squid ink pasta and Manhattan drink. Thanks for a great evening!,1
3135,Very nice atmosphere and great food. Service and drinks were great. We pulled the car up by the front doors and waited for valet. Nobody came out we drove around again and still there was nobody there. We end up parking down the street. When we came out of the restaurant there was a ticket on our windshield for a commercial loading zone. There were not any signs posted the fine was $140. We wanted to try RPM steak but the city of Chicago's parking enforcement left the bad taste in our mouth don't know if we'll return.,1
3136,Greatest food and greatest service. I'm from California and this is my second time back in Chicago and back at RPM. Favorite restaurant to go to when I'm in the city. Next time I come I'll be back eating at the restaurant.,1
3137,Lots of great seasonally pick entree's. Great small dishes. Staff is on top of their game! Great wine selection. Been here multiple times.,1
3138,"Celebrated a 1 yr wedding anniversary with my husband. This place was recommended by a friend but I’m sorry to say I did not enjoy at all. I liked the ambiance but when the orders were coming out, the waiter mistakenly served it to the guests at the table next to us but luckily we were able to catch them and tell them it was ours. This happened not once but twice. I know they’re busy but it was very disappointing with the high-end quality that we were expecting.

The food was also not really good. We had three kinds of pastas: carbonara, spicy king crab, and bucatini. The spicy king crab was our favorite of the three but wasn’t up to par of what we were expecting. For other two pastas, we both didn’t like the thickness of the pasta. It was like eating udon noodles with pasta sauce.

With the amount of money we paid for, the portions are very small and we won’t be back. We definitely know better Italian places than this .

とっても期待していただけにとても残念でした。
パスタが微妙だっただけでなく、テーブルが2度も間違えられ、サービスもそこそこ。ほかにおいしいイタリアンを知ってるのでそっち行きます。",0
3139,Went here for my birthday love the chocolate cake. I recommend going here. I whould definitely go back for special occasions. The staffs are nice the food was really good. Love the zucchini.,1
3140,"It was a wonderful experience, enjoyed my time very much. Absolutely worth it!",1
3141,"Great, lively atmosphere. This place is always busy even on Mondays and Tuesdays! I like to get the prosciutto service here. The food is good of course, but my advice is don't forget the dessert! The hazelnut tartufo, budino, and pistachio Gelato are my favorites!",1
3142,While the food is very good and the service is great if you are hungry and looking for large portions I would not recommend this restaurant. This is more of a place to grab drinks/coffee and dessert after eating somewhere with Normal size portions. The atmosphere is perfect for a first date but just eat something before going.,1
3143,"RPM Italian is simply Divine. Our server Kevin was absolutely amazing. I have to say, it was because of Kevin why my party enjoyed our time dinning in. I was amazed how Kevin was the only server in the bar & was able to suggest: drinks, apps, main course & my favorite desserts, all while serving every single table in the bar. Kevin walked us through our ""break from reality"" with his must-haves to try just once. Kevin turned our simple dinner plans into a walk of his food favorites we now made our favorites. Thank you Kevin for your honesty & more importantly your passion 🙏",1
3144,Great vibe and service. The food is fantastic and they make a mean old fashioned.,1
3145,"What a fun spot for a group, I had the sea scallops and they were delicious. Notable starters at the table were the prosciutto and steak tartare. For the sides, the brussel sprouts were the standout in the lineup for sure.",1
3146,"I took my cousin and her wife here to celebrate their wedding and we literally had the best experience dining out I’ve ever had in Chicago. Our waitress was absolutely amazing and the food was ridiculously good. Everyone was so generous and nice, bringing us free drinks and desserts to help celebrate them. Need to come back!!! Nina (our waitress), we loved you!!!",1
3147,Basically everything is amazing. Special with truffles was so worth it!,1
3148,"Great.  Love the truffle bread, lobster ravioli, short rib ravioli and meatballs. Just went back for my 10th time.   Allways amazing!  Truffel risotto!",1
3149,"I wanted to try this place out cause it came highly recommended by a friend. We walked in there round 5:30pm on a Saturday and got a table for two without waiting. We ordered the octopus appetizer which pretty good. We'll seasoned, great texture - not rubbery - perfectly cooked. We got two pasta entrées - the butternut squash agnolotti and the carbonara. The agnolotti was delicious and melted in your mouth. The carbonara was good although nothing special. The service aligned with other RPM restaurants and was top notch. However I'm only giving three stars because after two drinks, an appetizer and two entrées for the both of us, we left unsatisfied. Maybe it's expected to order multiple apps and entrées per person but we were already at $50 per person without tip and didn't want to spend anymore. It was seriously tempting to walk over to the McDonald's afterwards.",1
3150,"Always a great experience.  Food was amazing, service was top notch, and the dessert was a perfect way to end the evening!",1
3151,This place is a must go!! The shaved brussel sprouts salad is divine. The cacio e pepe and mama depandis pomodoro are so good! I got the GF Fettuccine and it was delicious! Service was fabulous and atmosphere was great. There is not one thing to dislike about this place. Definitely stop by when you're in Chicago!!,1
3152,"Delicious drinks, apps, entrees and desserts! Great service as well. Will definitely be coming back here!",1
3153,"Exquisite service, our server was upbeat, very engaging and very attentive. The black truffle risotto was heavenly and my fiance enjoyed his lobster ravioli and truffle garlic bread. We will absolutely be nack. Well done Juliana and Bill.",1
3154,"Expensive place, but it's worth it! The food is great and the service is amazing:) people dress really nice here",1
3155,"Before our fav restaurant was Perry’s Steakhouse, now RPM beat it!

Best food I tried ever! Inside of the restaurant is so nice , waiters are wearing suit’s , looks so gorgeous, just love it.

I didn’t make any pictures, just leaving a review!)",1
3156,Dre is the BEST 💯 highly recommended- all safety precautions in place 💕 would go again - food is AMAZING 🎉🥳🎉 perfect place to celebrate our birthday! 🎂,1
3157,"The food is very good.  Not over-portioned, fully adequate.
Service was prompt and courteous....but.....
Our waiter was the master of 'bait and switch' which I have to believe they are trained for.  Be very specific and careful.

For example: I asked for their basic $12  Old Fashioned.  He immediately tried to upgrade me to their $17 version. I declined and said I wanted the $12 one on the menu. He asked me which rye.  I said whatever you use. He asked again what I liked and gave me some examples.  I choose an inexpensive Bulleit rye.  Turns out, by making this a call drink....it was now $19.

I may go back, but will simply point at the menu and say nothing.

On the other hand, our sommelier was incredibly well versed , gracious, and friendly. She was young,  but totally impressive in wine knowledge and demeanor.",1
3158,If you're there during the week ask for Dre! One of the best experiences I've ever had out to eat!,1
3159,Everything was sooo delicious. We got the peppers and burrata salad to start. Peppers were a little sweet but super flavorful and the dressing in the salad was so yummy. The bucatini was a little more al dente than I prefer but the eggplant was amazing! Highly recommend and super veg friendly,1
3160,Really pleasant staff from the hosts to server to manager. Every single thing we ordered was excellent!,1
3161,Make sure that you arrive at your exact reservation time. You will not be seated until every member of your party has arrived. No offers for water or a drink while you are waiting.,0
3162,"So im not sure where to start.. This was the best food I've ever eaten. Im not exaggerating or trying to be nice. I had the steak and it was religious for me.. The Brussel sprouts and whipped potatoes were magical. Do not pass this up. You will be happy with anything you get from here. My compliments to the chef, it was life changing!",1
3163,"Great Italian food, reasonable prices, modern style restaurant.",1
3164,Awsome happy hour specials! Great service!,1
3165,"This place lived up to every bit of the hype I had heard. Service was amazing, the entire staff seemed to really enjoy what they were doing. So many regards to the company they worked for too (way to go RPM!).

Food was phenomenal, truly special.

Can't wait to go back!!",1
3166,Food was very tasty and wonderful and the service from our server Kevin was outstanding! First time dining at RPM Italian will definitely be back.,1
3167,"My favorite go-to restaurant in Chicago! Everything is delicious, but my top dishes are the brussel sprouts salad, the steak tartare and the pasta carbonara. And save room for desserts because ALL of their desserts are amazing, you can’t go wrong there either!",1
3168,First time at this restaurant and it did not disappoint. Nice atmosphere.  Food and drinks were great.,1
3169,We have been coming here for 8 years and have always loved the food here and the atmosphere. Highly disappointed tonight. The menu doesn’t have half of the food they use to serve and what we did have was sub-par.,0
3170,"Absolutely amazing!!  Best dining experience I've ever had!  A group of 4 of us came in for dinner to celebrate a few birthdays.  The guys ordered cocktails and the girls split a bottle of champagne.  We started off with 4 appetizers that were to die for!  The service was hands down the best service we've ever experienced.  The place was packed from the time we arrived, Friday August 25th at 8:30 until the time we left (maybe around 11?).  We wanted to relax and enjoy the night out and not once did we feel rushed to finish our appetizers or meal.  Three of us ordered the fresh pasta meal and one ordered the lobster dinner.  Everything tasted so fresh and amazing.  I wish i could remember our waitress's name, she was amazing and did everything she could to make sure out experience was exceptional!  I cannot wait to go back!!",1
3171,Love going here for dinner. The menu is not innovative but tasty Italian dishes. Happy hour drinks are also a good idea since the bartenders are professional.,1
3172,You need reservations and long time waiting here. My favorite is Prime beef meatball.,1
3173,"Beautiful restaurant and delicious food!! We love the truffle bread, meatballs, salad, parmesan risotto, and lobster ravioli. We've been here many times and it never disappoints!",1
3174,Everything was so tasty !!! Chocolate dessert was amazing as well,1
3175,"I ordered for carry out tonight and I would give RPM Italian 10 stars if I could. It’s been so long since we had a carry out meal that tasted as good as if we’d been seated at a table only feet from the kitchen. We had the truffled garlic bread which the helping is enough to feed a few hungry adults. The flavor was great! The homemade bucatini pasta is fresh and the sauce is delicious. I ordered the GF chicken parmesan and it tasted just like normal chicken parm. The flavor of the sauce and cheese on top complemented the dish perfectly. And to top it off, when I picked up the food the staff at the front was incredibly friendly, attentive and hardworking. I will definitely order from here again.",1
3176,My friend brought me here for my bday and I loved the ambiance. Andre was very knowledgeable and a fantastic server The Prawns were delicious and the brocollini. Broccolini,1
3177,"Great service and amazing food. The meatballs and ricotta we're great starters. And while the pasta portions are a little smaller then what people are used to, about 4oz , they are delicious and I highly recommend the Bolognese.  We finished off with the rice pudding which was a substantial portion but was rich and creamy and a nice way to end the night. The only problem we had was with getting seated as the hostess thought we had been seated and we ended up waiting over 10 minutes even with having a reservation.",1
3178,"I went here for my fiancé’s birthday. I will start with the positives: the food is absolutely incredible. The pasta was perfectly al dente. However, the service could use some serious improvement. It wasn’t until 20 minutes after we were seated that we finally had our drink orders taken. And the bottle we ordered came a long time after that. The glass I received was dirty and I had to ask for a new one. Then, we ordered the burrata appetizer and it didn’t come until 45 minutes later! And I am not even exaggerating since our server came by and said “I don’t know where your burrata is since I put it in over 30 minutes ago”. The server never asked if we wanted to order entrees, I had to flag him down myself to order. When the burrata finally did come, we were already enjoying our entrees .  In my experience, the appetizers come before the entrees. I wasn’t really in the mood for burrata and bead when I finally got my pasta. I think they should have comped our appetizer since it didn’t even come as an appetizer. It came as a mid- dinner snack, but we still paid for it.",0
3179,Absolutely amazing!  If you get the opportunity to try this I highly recommend it.,1
3180,"The salad, garlic bread and chicken par were IMMACULATE. The waitress was so lovely too and gave us mini ice cream w a happy anniversary sign.  Definitely worth every cent.",1
3181,"For my wife's birthday, we did date night at RPM on a Friday night around 7pm-ish a few weeks ago. However, much to my disappointment, we were seated next to a family of three with a ~12 year old kid wearing basketball shorts and Mom carrying shopping bags and sandals.  Quick look around saw others dress similarly. Perhaps it's my fault for not doing my due diligence, but not exactly a date night ambiance since the waiters were all wearing jackets.  Very confusing.",0
3182,Absolutely lovely! We were in town with our friends celebrating their anniversary! Nina our waitresses made our time very special. Great atmosphere and delicious food!,1
3183,"The restaurant is gorgeous, the atmosphere is classy. The food was a little hit or miss - I had a fabulous ""R"" spritz, a mediocre salad, delicious pasta, and decadent dessert. My friends didn't enjoy their pasta dishes as much, and the scallops were okay at best. However, the dessert (pistachio cake) won over all of our hearts and tastebuds. Overall, we thought we overpaid given the general quality of the food, but we left happy and full so can't complain too much.",1
3184,"We had never been there before, but the food was excellent as was the service. We were seated quickly. The menu is unique and eclectic. The food arrived hot and was timed appropriately. Our server was awesome. She made recommendations on appetizers and drinks. We asked her what was in a particular salad and she named every ingredient! Our experience was fantastic and we will be adding RPM to our rotation!",1
3185,"After having a not so great time, the staff reached out, apologized for my experience, and offered dinner on them the next time I returned.

I came back for the second time and was blown away. I sat at the bar, and Stephani was great! She was very attentive and friendly.  I ordered the pepperoni pizza to start and the Chicken Parmesan as my entree. The pizza was delicious, and the Chicken Parmesan was amazing. I am so happy I gave this place another chance. Thank you Huntington, Stephani, and the rest of the staff. I will most definitely be coming back here!

------------------------------My original review is below------------------------------------

I really wanted to love this place, but I was disappointed in the food and service. I came in for my birthday with really high expectations. The tables were super close together, I felt like I was practically on top of the people sitting next to me on either side.

The food came fast, but it was room temperature when it got to me :( I ordered the short rib pasta, and it was just not good at all. I felt like I was eating chili flakes instead of pasta.I would have sent the food back, but our server did not come and check up on us. I understand, 8pm on a Saturday is busy, but I still expected some service. I just ate the food because I was hungry and didn't feel like waiting another half an hour or so for them to potentially bring me another lukewarm dish.

When we finally finished up, the server asked if we wanted anything else. We said no, and he was like, not even your birthday dessert?? I'm not trying to be nit picky but I've never been to a restaurant where they blatantly ask you if you want your birthday treat. They usually just bring it out because it's supposed to be somewhat of a surprise. I was so frustrated and disappointed at this point with the food and service I just replied no.

I do want to mention that my boyfriend really enjoyed his food. I'm not sure if my dish was just made improperly but it kinda sucked when I was here to celebrate a special occasion.",1
3186,"If there are more than 5 stars, I'll give him a lot of roles. The staff is extremely useful and will remember your name and knowledge. This is where we are going, and we need many of my recommended friends. BF even took his company staff, where it would be super. That's what we love its scope. Nice weather. Snack to perfection. The beef reminds us of the balkalb. Everything else is excellent. Great choice for drinks and a rich wine list. Good food and atmosphere. Excellent service. Excellent wine list. Attentive staff. The acquaintance is a good place for a girl/man in the evenings or corporate events.",1
3187,"We had a wonderful Italian dinner here. Noelle was kind, attentive, and provided great service. The homemade ricotta and the dessert donuts were amazing!",1
3188,"Had a reservation for 8:15PM that was made a week prior and was finally seated at 8:40PM after 7 other parties were seated ahead of us along with a rude encounter with the hostess. There were multiple tables open in the primary dining room however we took a turn towards the bathrooms and I knew the experience was over. Seated in the corner in a backroom of the restaurant, we ordered a drink to make up for the 50$ we spent to make a reservation and left. I would never recommend",0
3189,"Eh. Really, only good service got it to 4 stars. Nothing was 'bad', but nothing exceptional either, especially not $250 for a party of 4 exceptional. Risotto did not develop a sauce, just thick rice. Roasted chicken dark meat was good, white very dry, sauce was good. Side of roasted mushrooms very good. Scampi got a good review but note it is not a traditional garlic and white wine version. Appetizer breads were good as was the gelato. Wines very overpriced.",1
3190,"We attempted to have RPM cater our 50th Wedding Anniversary. After a week of emailing, phoning and leaving voice messages with no response, on the 8th day by speaking to someone in reservations,  I made contact with an asst. caterer ,who informed us that they could cater the event, that she would have the head of catering call me within two hours, and they would email a proposed menu to me. Needless to say, I received no call and no email, (spam and trash checked.) Tried calling and leaving messages for the next two days, but no response. Booked a caterer in the community. On Thursday, July 22, four days before our party, Sunday, July 25, RPM called asking if we still wanted to cater. I shared my disappointment and the very nice lady said she would send me her personal email ,so next time we wanted to cater we could contact her. I said that it was not necessary, she insisted, but it was never sent.  The Rancics and the Melmans state quality and service are of the highest importance in their business.  The two women I spoke to were excellent communicators, but there was no action behind their words and there was no service. Our friends had catered with RPM for their 50th, and highly recommended it. I am well aware of the difficulties faced by the restaurant industry, but this is beyond difficult.",0
3191,"Great place - we tried the garlic bread, stuffed fried olives, flatbread pizza, multiple entrees and wine. All was outstanding and we will be back. Our waiter told us the pasta dishes were on the small size but we felt it was the perfect sized portion.",1
3192,"I've been a huge fan of RPM Italian for years now and as far as I'm concerned it's still a top spot to visit for food and drinks. If there's one thing that keeps me coming back it's the Spicy King Crab over black ink squid pasta! Seriously my favorite and so good! All around the portions are definitely on the smaller side and meant for sharing bites but all in all still straight up amazing. Can't really go wrong with anything you order here.

Service I've experienced in the many visits here is mostly good, but when things are going so well they've always tried to make it right which is always appreciated. I can't emphasis enough you'll definitely need reservations if you want to be seated in the dining room. The bar area you can usually score a high top or up at the bar for two if you aren't about putting reservations in.

Not much else on this one. 'Til next time!",1
3193,"My friends wanted to go to this restaurant, so I accompanied them, and I'm very glad I did! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable. We particularly loved their sweet peppers and cheese appetizer and freaked on their fantastic desserts! Do visit if you like good Italian food",1
3194,"Incredible restaurant. We started at the bar for drinks and brought our favorite bottle of wine. The Som; I think her name was Allison’s, noticed and made the effort to ask if she could decant it for us while we waited for a table. She was also familiar with the wine. We enjoyed the Caprese Lobster as an appetizer. Delicious. We showed up early for our reservation in hopes to get seated and they were able to accommodate and seated us 30 minutes early. Our server was so friendly and took great care of us. We ordered warm bread, salad, and two pasta dishes. Everything was incredible. I wish I lived in Chicago and could eat there every night so that I could work my way through the menu. We will definitely be back.",1
3195,"I couldn't wait to dine at this restaurant so I was able to make reservation for this past sunday ( Oct 13)for my birthday. The ambiance was beautiful,  the food was good especially the Garlic bread. The problem I had was our waiter, I don't remember his name but he was bald and very unfriendly. He only checked on us to take order and fill water.  He never asked how we were doing, how was our food or if we needed anything else. After my boyfriend and I were finished with our dinner the waiter came by and dropped off the dessert menu and walked away. Horrible communication,  I saw the man who was delivering and picked up our plates more and he was very friendly. I'm really disappointed on our service ,especially since it was my birthday weekend. I highly doubt I'll go back.",0
3196,"Quality and taste of the food was great. Environment was good as well. Very average service. Prices did not reflect the portions. I still ate dinner somewhere else after visiting this restaurant.

UPDATE: I am editing my original review because the owner reached out in effort to correct my experience. I appreciate the offer and generosity and the acknowledgment of my review. Thank you for taking the time to try to make things right. While I do not live in the area to be able to enjoy RPM a second time, I hope to be back when I return to Chicago. Thank you again!",1
3197,"Well priced, nice vibe, big bar area, EXCELLENT food.  Very impressed",1
3198,"Classy Italian restaurant. Some authentic meals whereas other dishes not really but still tasty.. Octopus appetizer and spicy king crab spaghetti with squid ink are particularly recommended. Good vibe, especially at the bar. Professional crew and outstanding service. Recommended",1
3199,"Enjoyed a great dinner at RPM. If you have the opportunity to get the truffle risotto, or anything with truffles, you should do it",1
3200,"Food is excellent - other stellar reviews are justified. Service was top notch - people were checking on us, not excessively but very attentive. Fried olives are suprusingly amazing. Truffle garlic bread is old - fashioned don't hold the butter delicious. Fresh pasta and marinara sauce ( perfect to soak up with bread) are very yummy. Prime beef meatballs are quite good. Too full to try an entree but oh so happy.",1
3201,Great meal again. But city of Chicago you need to allow indoor dining.  They could have more socially distanced in their large restaurant then they were able to in the outside tents.  Indiana allows 50 percent occupancy and we have been fine. South Carolina has 100 percent restaurant occupancy and their covid rate is 8 percent.   Restaurants aren't the problem,1
3202,Squid Ink Pasta for the win! RPM Italian's food is delicious and fresh. Service and staff are always courteous and timely. Ambience is sultry but is sometimes buzzing with business folk or groups out for the night. The space is clean and thoughtfully laid out using every for seating.,1
3203,"It was a good restaurant, with very high quality food, although the portions were very small. It would be a good place to go on a date night, but with my family of 5 we had to get more because there wasn't enough. The bread filled me up more than the pasta, but the pasta was one of the best quality ones I've every had. Overall good restaurant except for size.",1
3204,"My favorite place for a special occasion.  Great food, attentive staff and a fun place to eat.  I highly recommend.",1
3205,"Our waiter surprised us with the most amazing dessert 😭😭. We told him it was coming up, and he brought this out. This truly made our night! The food was great, I had Chicken Parmesan! Perfectly cooked, juicy chicken and the marinara was to die for! Will be coming back.",1
3206,"No one ever answers the phone at this restaurant!!! They are very good at hanging up the phone, but it'll ring endlessly. This is not the expectation one should have from a restaurant of this caliber!!!!! And portions extremely small! This was a complete joke",0
3207,Absolutely fantastic experience. Great decor. Food was impressive. We really loved the black truffle risotto and the carbonara (my 8 yr old put it in his top 3 foods ever). Highly recommend it if you like a great Italian restaurant.,1
3208,"Simply superb! Amazing food, exceptional service and fantastic atmosphere.  Jackie M is the BEST! She made our first dining experience at RPM a most memorable night! If we didn't live ALL the way in Louisiana, we'd be back on a weekly basis.  Thank you RPM Italian and Jackie for treating us like family!",1
3209,"Walked in on a busy weekend evening at prime time but only had to wait 15 minutes for a first come, first served bar table.  The service was really wonderful (friendly, helpful, full of great recommendations) - when part of our order was forgotten, they comped it. The food was out-of-this-world delicious. I had the prosciutto tortelloni and it melted in my mouth. Our server recommended a delectable wine to go with it, so I was thrilled. Everyone was happy with their plates. Others have mentioned the portions are a bit small - I would say they're quite normal for a higher end restaurant where the expectation is you will sit for apps, drinks, dinner and dessert.  Filling enough, but yes - small if you're expecting a plate of spaghetti the size of your head. Mine was perfectly sized for me!",1
3210,Amazing!! We were in town for the holidays and went as an anniversary dinner. Everything we ordered was delicious. My husband is GF and he was able to eat both steak and pasta. The thing that put it over the top was the amazing service. We left our waitress a 40% tip because she was THAT GOOD. Already excited about going back the next time we are in Chicago.,1
3211,"Our entire experience was great from start to finish. They saved a great table for us for our anniversary dinner, our server was incredible, and the food was extremely delicious though portions are smaller and pricey. Wine list will set you back a few $$$ but there are great choices. Go in with some cash to burn and enjoy the delicious food.",1
3212,This is the best Italian restaurant in Chicago. The food is amazing. The service and the space extraordinary! I have been many times in the past. My most recent visit was to celebrate our anniversary. They made the night extra special! So many little touches that made our night celebrating perfect.  I highly recommend RPM!,1
3213,Good ambience and service. Ribeye could have been seasoned a bit more.  No free starters like warm bread etc,1
3214,Food is amazing but the portions are small. I had the lobster ravioli and tried the veal stuffed ravioli. The hazelnut dessert was SO good!! Also has a good list of wine selections. Would definitely recommend this place for special occasions as it is a bit pricey for their portions.,1
3215,"Impressive Italian cuisine and service.  Wines are pricey at 3x shop price, but the ate some reasonably priced bottles that won't break the bank. My wife and I went heavy on the appetizers, and I went with a fantastic pasta with veal ragout... pretty damn good!",1
3216,"This was a tough review to write. RPM rightfully has the reputation as being one of the best restaurants in the city - if you're not on a budget.

Service is impeccable, food is great (but not IMHO outstanding) and good for sharing (they will even cut up a ribeye to share), and the atmosphere is actually really enjoyable - we didn't feel rushed and had a great time people-watching.

Would I go back? Definitely, as a special treat.",1
3217,"I absolutely love RPM Italian. I've been here three times now. The atmosphere is more modern and trendy, but it's really comfortable and I don't feel like I'm sitting on top of other tables. Request a booth if you want ultimate comfort. For the people who are complaining the portions are small, the majority of the menu is small plates. When we go, we always order several items and share them across the table. If you're looking for your own meal, order from the entrees. The service has always been impeccable. The food hot and fresh. And the waiters are always knowledgeable of the menu. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone.",1
3218,"My Wife and I came here about an hour before closing on a weekday and never felt rushed, there was no wait. The pasta dishes were simply amazing, one of the best pastas I've had. The lobster + pasta was also really good (photo). Overall great atmosphere, beautiful decor, and wonderful service. Would come back here :)",1
3219,"I couldn’t give 5 stars because I expected excellence.  I sat at the bar prepared to try several items. I started with the Caesar wedge. Any salad swimming in dressing is a deal breaker.  It was so bad that I asked for a separate plate to transfer the lettuce and the bartender didn’t even offer to have the salad made over with less dressing.  I then ordered the meatballs that were so salty that I ate 1 and decided to not eat anymore..  I expected meatballs with garlic oregano basil lots of flavor but i couldn’t taste any of that for the salt!   My first visit to Chicago, but this was a disappointment for me.   Atmosphere was an A+. Portions were good  and the service was good but not really concerned with customer satisfaction,  sorry, I expected better.",1
3220,"My new favorite restaurant. RPM Italian is definitely worth it, I fell in love with it the moment we sat at our table. It's best to make a reservation ahead, but if you have to wait, you won't be disappointed. The food was delicious, the staff was amazing and the ambiance was great. My only regret is not getting any dessert",1
3221,We came here for our anniversary and it was a delightful experience.,1
3222,Pricey. But the service is excellent and the quality of the food mostly worth it.,1
3223,Best Brussels EVER. I come into town solely for these. 10/10,1
3224,"Love this place! Must go here if you are in Chicago! The pastas here are incredible and they have an amazing wine selection, truly something for everyone. The seasonal dishes are especially good so make sure to try them. Our server was amazing and very attentive and had the BEST recommendations. The desserts are even more decadent and delicious. I loved everything I tried here and I can't wait to come back and try this place again.",1
3225,"I absolutely love this restaurant and everything about it! To start off, our server was Kasha who has excellent customer service! She truly helped make our night great! The ambience at this restaurant is great especially if you like fine dining. I have visited many fine dining restaurants, but this one has to be one of the best! The cheesecake there was amazing! Harley the manager came by and spoke to us which was great! It isn't often that you see the manager checking up on the guest. Overall great experience! I will definitely be recommending this restaurant to friends and family.",1
3226,A must-visit when we are in Chicago. Food is EXCELLENT and so is the service. Highly recommend for tapas!,1
3227,Food was great got the scallops and the taste and texture was on point. My only this is for those is it only comes with 4. Honestly I think at least 6 or 8 for the price but it was good. Sending love from southern California,1
3228,A little noisy but everything was amazing and GREAT service.,1
3229,"This was our second visit to RPM. The first time everything went perfectly. This time, however, besides our waitress, who happened to be witty, personable, and diligent, the food was severely lacking. The risotto was bland (even with the addition of truffles), the tortellini was undercooked, and the mashed potatoes were room temperature. While none of it was exceptionally awful, it was not exceptionally delicious either. What saved it for us was the lemon cake which was refreshing and a perfect note to end on after a disappointing dinner. Additionally, the busser’s station was right behind our table and all we heard was constant banging of glass water carafes. I hope RPM is not losing its touch.",1
3230,"Great food, staff, and atmosphere! Oh, the deserts were delicious too.",1
3231,"We were so happy we chose this restaurant! It was our 1st anniversary. Food was great , service was really good. Special thanks to our waiter Shane C. Who was more then friendly and warm ,he described our choice of dishes just perfectly. Slowly cooked pork with the black figs was amazing!  At the end of the night we got two drinks on the house. great experience with this restaurant",1
3232,"The food was wonderful, delicious and very well presented. The portions were perfect. Our waiter Ryan was absolutely wonderful as well, he was fun and very professional. Ryan made us feel very welcome and he did a fabulous job at serving as well as the others that helped bring our food. The atmosphere is relaxing and beautiful. We can't wait to go back!",1
3233,"Amazing! We got the two veg dishes on the menu and we weren't completely excited, but these flavourful meals blew our minds! (One was topped with popcorn?!) We were too full for dessert but would have tried anything on the list after those great entrees. I'd recommend to anyone! Side note: I'm gluten free and they were ready to accommodate!",1
3234,Thank you for the amazing service and the time everyone took to say happy Anniversary.  It’s the small things that make the experience amazing and you did that.  Appetizer was tasty and reminded us of India and the main course was delicious..we had the zucchini for app and roasted chickens for main..they also surprised us with champagne and desert but the service was over the top and highly recommended.,1
3235,"First experience here was fantastic. Second time around wasn't as great. Rosemary was the main ingredient in the short rib bolognese, overpowering. The Italian salad was a complete disappointment, two thinly sliced pieces of salami hidden by onions and lettuce. Always excited about tiramisu, but this one was completely frozen. Before I forget, the lobster ravioli was extremely fishy.  Granted, the garlic bread was delicious and so were the artichokes (only 3 for $14) but they aren't enough to bring me back. There are too many other high-end Italian restaurants in Chicago to try.",1
3236,Top 10 Best Chi restaurants! My favorites and so good!,1
3237,"I had been to RPM a few times when it first opened and did not have a good experience with the hosts and our waitresses. However, my son wanted to celebrate his Golden Birthday so we made a reservation for last week. The host was super nice. She seated us right away and our waitress was wonderful. She was very friendly and even wished him a Happy Birthday & brought out dessert for him. Great foods especially the steak and squid ink pasta. I wish I had written down our waitress name! I think I'll be back more often!",1
3238,"Had a very nice anniversary dinner here. Service was good and the atmosphere was loud but enjoyable. Food was quite good. Yes, portions are small but it's considered to be tapas. Portions were actually quite nice, usually pasta places give way too much food and I end up in a carb coma for the night.",1
3239,"I came here with my wife for our anniversary, and it was an amazing experience.
The food was delicious, and we'll portioned. The lobster ravioli was phenomenal, as was the garlic bread.
The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable.
It was a experience that was amazing.",1
3240,Great atmosphere.  We went with a small group and were able to try a lot of dishes.  Everything we ate was great.  My favorite dishes were the eggplant parmigiana and truffled garlic bread.  Being a vegetarian it was nice that they had a few options and were able to accommodate on other dishes. A little overpriced but ambiance and service makes up for it.,1
3241,L💗VE RPM!!! Amazing cocktails! And the food is unbelievable! Can't wait for Easter brunch.,1
3242,"While the quality of food, presentation and customer service is top notch, their portion sizes are horrendously small compared to the prices they charge. Each portion, whether appetizers or dinner, are so tiny you'll be leaving with a less-than appetizing experience. However the taste of food is unmatched; possibly one of the best tasting restaurants in all of Chicago.

The crab bruschetta appetizer, while delicious, is just a tiny 4 pieces charging $20. I laughed at the the lobster ravioli dinner when I was served just 6 pieces of ravioli; you'll be done in 5 minutes wondering where another $25 went and you've barely swallowed anything.

You will certainly leave hungry if you come here for food; if you come for the atmosphere, drinks, photo opportunities to show off on your social media, then you've come to the right place. If you come for what this establishment was intended to be, which is a fine dining restaurant, unfortunately you will not be satisfied with their extremely tiny portions.",0
3243,Amazing food and garlic balls. Been coming here for years and still they amaze me. Highly recommended,1
3244,"My husband and I made early dinner reservations for 4:45pm and were promptly seated. Our waiter, Kevin, was patient while taking our orders and knowledgeable about the menu. The apps and entrees were fantastic. We ordered too much bread though because we didn't realize the cheese tray came with bread as well. For the entrees, we especially love the lobster squid ink spaghetti, mushroom risotto, and butternut squash pasta. Our pasta dishes were brought out all together and quickly. If you need a pick me up after all the pasta, the Gelato cold brew coffee float is great. The ambiance of the restaurant is romantic, chic, and classy. I'd recommend this place for special occasions, a late night spot, or just drinks at the lively, vibrant bar",1
3245,Great ambience good food and good service all around.,1
3246,"Fantastic food, great atmosphere, and wonderful  staff! Got engaged and took my fiance out after. Had a spectacular meal and experience. Thank you RPM Italian for the memories.",1
3247,"The view from the street does not do this place justice. My coworker and I were looking for a place to eat after a long day at a conference. We consider ourselves fortunate that we are here!

We didn't have a reservation, but they were able to seat us at the bar, which was still very nice. The interior of the restaurant was very clean and contemporary, with moody lighting, modern furnishings, and clean bathrooms.

Our waiter was the one of the most attentive and pleasant servers I have ever had, making sure my drink was never empty and that our food was up to expectation.

I ordered the risotto primavera, which was creamy and delicious, with quality long-grain rice, as it should be. The portion was also exactly the right size. It wasn't the best risotto I've ever had, but it was reasonably good and well worth it.

We did not order dessert, but I almost regret it. The next time I'm in Chicago, I will definitely be returning to RPM to check out more of the fare.",1
3248,"Fun, laid back atmosphere with classic Italian dishes.",1
3249,Extraordinary steak and excellent entrées and side dishes! Lemon mouse desert is just wonderful,1
3250,"Excellent, lively atmosphere and great food.",1
3251,"Super trendy and high end Italian food. Went with a group of my wife's coworkers and had a nice time. Appetizers were great, as were the entrees. The spicy king crab pasta was quite good. The portions for pasta dishes are small compared to other Italian restaurants (obviously smaller than family style places), but are great if you get an appetizer or two to share.",1
3252,"First time visit. The food was delicious. They were booked a week out so we ate in the lounge bar area, which was fine for us. Chelsea was our server - she was so nice and helpful, taking the time to explain the menu. We asked her about other restaurants to eat at and after dinner she gave us a list of places to go with an explanation of why (great views, atmosphere, food taste, etc.) I will come back here again for sure!",1
3253,"I waited a long time to go to this place given the celebrity status. I was able to make a reservation months in advance for a Friday at 6pm for my sister's birthday. Given all the hype we had high expectations. It's a cool space and I definitely feel the celebrity vibe. The food was good, but not exceptional, especially given the hype. Our server spilled water all over my brother in law, and we got free desserts (all of them). The desserts were really good! I don't know if I'll go back given the difficulty to get in, but it is nice for special occasions. You just need to plan ahead.",1
3254,"One of our top favorite restaurants in the city, we order delivery and dine in regularly.

The atmosphere/ambiance is incredible, and service is too notch. Bar service, cocktails and wines are incredibly well curated and executed.

And the food. Oh the food. So incredibly delicious. They throw truffle around with wild abandon and it is spectacular. Their Bolognese is my go-to, and make sure to get some truffle garlic bread too.",1
3255,"My sister and I met there while I was in town for work. She made reservations for us at 5pm. When I arrived at 4:30pm the restaurant was empty with the exception of about 3 people. The receptionist / host said she could not find the reservations and if my sister made it in past 5pm, she could not seat us. Again, there were only 3 people. Strike one. Sissy came in at 4:45pm so we were seated (still only 3 people). Our waitress was nice but  hard selling some items. To the point of pure annoyance. Strike two. We ordered an app (bread! Ha!), entrees and plenty of wine. The 'bread' app was bland and meh, my meal was just okay. The pasta was decent, but the chicken was overcooked. For the price, this place is sub-par. I would not go back. Ever. PS - in the 2 hours we were there, the place was still not 100% packed. So, why would the host say she could not seat us?!",0
3256,"90+ minutes and no entree. They did the right thing by taking the apps off the bill. Mothers Day w 2 little ones or else we would have waited.  Food is great, so will be back when we have more time without kids.",1
3257,This is a place to see and be seen but also has good food. Be prepared to wait a little and go with the flow. I haven't been here since before covid but the food is great and the service is as on point as ever.,1
3258,"We were very excited to try this place. Got seated right away, & table was great. Clean lines, chic venue. However, we had to ask someone to check on our waiter because no one had come to take our drink order after 10 minutes. This was an 11:15 PM reservation, so it wasn’t exactly packed. The artichokes were absolutely delicious. Pasta was exceptional. Got the bucatini & tortellini. Highly recommend! The steak in the steak frites was flavorful, especially with the sauce, but there were no frites to speak of. It came with crispy potato shreds that were more like a garnish than a side. Very disappointing when you pay for & expect a steak frites dish. I’m all for an inventive take, but the menu didn’t reflect that, & it really cheapened the dish. Strong standout, simple dishes, but they need to work on service & mains. A lot of potential to be an amazing experience.",1
3259,"Great food, the lobster ravioli is the best pasta dish I have ever had. The meatballs and garlic bread made a great appetizer per our waiters recommendation. The garlic whipped potatoes are also amazing. My only complaint would be the artichokes were not very flavorful and didn't meet the description of the menu, overall I highly recommend this place!",1
3260,Outstanding place to enjoy a genuine meal.  Our dishes were flavorful and the presentation was on par.  Our server was an expert on the menu and was clearly passionate about what she did.  She didn't rush us and took time to answer all our questions.  Would highly recommend this place.,1
3261,Restaurant was awesome. I must say that their garlic bread was the best I have ever tasted in my entire life. The rest of the meal was just as delicious. Pricing was reasonable and service was absolutely excellent. Will definitely be visiting this restaurant again in the near future.,1
3262,I had the cowboy well done woth a lobster tail. I would say it was one of the greatest pieces of meat that I’ve ever had. Things are really here good it’s worth the price,1
3263,Best meal in Almost 50 years of life!,1
3264,I have been before and I thought it was awesome enough to take my boyfriend here on our anniversary & he loved it as well! The food exceeds expectations and we definitely recommend the hazelnut tartuffo. Our waiter Andre gave us excellent service and explained all of the dishes well!,1
3265,It was great service but I just have to be honest. The food was great but I wouldn’t say 5 star great compared to the pricing. And they don’t have Tiramisu on the menu under traditional Italian desserts... how is that? Cheesecake is on there tho it’s more American than “traditional” Italian.,1
3266,"The burrata is to die for!! Definitely try the crispy Brussels, also probably the best Brussel sprouts I've ever had (and I'm not a huge fan). We also had the potato gnocchi and lobster ravioli. Both were good but not the best I've had. Overall a wonderful experience. Service was good as well. If you want a table, you'll need a reservation but the bar is usually open before 6pm. After that there's definitely a wait.",1
3267,"Their food was fantastic and tasty. The portions  were smaller than I would expect with the prices being so high, and should be categorized as small plates instead of entrees. The service was on point here and don't forget to make a reservation during COVID",1
3268,"Food here is okay. I personally do enjoy the smaller plates as they feel like tapas. The menu is divided in 3 with your starters, pastas, an entrees. We ordered a couple starters and pastas as shareables then we each got an entree. Despite the small portions we ended up taking some home.
Our waiter was extremely friendly and offered good suggestions, service was definitely excellent. The atmosphere was pretty pretentious, but easily overlooked. It was a great first time experience, but the food was average for the price, I likely won't be coming here again.",1
3269,Visiting from Boston and picked RPM randomly. We had our 12 month old granddaughter with us.   Didn’t have a reservation but Elizabeth (hostess) was extremely accommodating and got us a table in the bar area.   The food and service were outstanding!   Highly recommend.,1
3270,"Great birthday dinner! Being we’re were visiting from out of town, we brought our 9 and 12 year old girls with us. While my 9 year old was very reluctant, my 12 year old was loving it! The whole meal was fun and a great experience!! The good was DELICIOUS!! After the food came out, my picky eater was won over immediately by an amazing steak! The pastas were so good and the carbonara was INCREDIBLE. It was an all around super fun time!!",1
3271,"I attended a corporate event in the back room. The staff were fantastic. They were present and visible in their clean white jackets without being in the way, and were very professional. We had appetizers and a buffet dinner. The food served for both was outstanding and appropriate. The sausage gnocchi was particularly good. They also served a variety of small desserts, each wonderful. The gelato was the standout. If you are looking to book a business or personal event in the area, I highly recommend RPM Italian.",1
3272,Wonderful atmosphere. Appetizers were outstanding. Veal parmigiana was a bit overcooked as were our scallops. Everything else was great. Fantastic drink selections and extensive wine list.,1
3273,"Always excellent Service and very friendly people.
Amazing and authentic Italian food.
Very fresh and so tasty ..!!!
Do not miss the fabulous dessert especially the gelato who are made by the restaurant.
The wines list also is a Must
Definitely an outstanding Italian restaurant ..!!",1
3274,"They are very accommodating. It was 7:30 and they had the dining room closed for some reason, so it was very packed. They told us it may be a while and the bar was full but to have a seat. Within 15 minutes they found us a table!

Drinks were good, I had the mushroom risotto and a pumpkin pasta (I forgot the name). Risotto wasn't my cup of team but the pasta was good but very very small.

I forgot my receipt at the table which I needed for a business expense report. I called in 4 days later and the manager was able to email it to me. Thank you providing excellent customer service.",1
3275,Very beautiful place with a cozy ambience and great chill music. The waiting time is about 0 they are very quick. Personnel is friendly and waitresses are super nice as well and classy. Food is super delicious.They have also healthy options like sword fish and amazing Italian signature pasta. My husband and I loved it.,1
3276,"Recently had a birthday dinner here. RPM was very accommodating, and was able to seat our party of 8 as two separate tables of 4 right next to each other (policy due to covid). We pre-ordered appetizers for all of us- beef tartar, tuna bruschetta, prosciutto, burrata, and truffled garlic bread, all of which were good. The pasta I had was the pappardelle bolognese, which I recommend. My favorite cocktail was the espresso martini; I usually don't like this drink, but It was so good I ended up having 2 of them!",1
3277,"Food was delicious & service was great!  I have to say thou that $32.00 for 4 scallops, they should have been cooked perfect.  3 of them were slightly over cooked for my taste.  I would definitely go back!",1
3278,My partner asked where did I want to spend our anniversary and of course I answered with RPM Italian! We had our first dinner here a year ago... and just like today it was amazing! Servers are professional! Delicious food! & my partner really enjoyed his old fashion! I forgot our servers name but he was such a sweetheart!,1
3279,"I am the Technical Assistant for a high school culinary arts class in Michigan.  In September of 2018, my colleague and I introduced a fundraiser to allow our students the opportunity to take a foodie field trip to Chicago at the end of the year for an exceptional dining experience. RPM Italian was the restaurant we chose to attend on June 2nd, 2019. We were so happy with our decision.

From the very beginning, the staff on the phone was so accommodating.  They worked with our large party by allowing us to split up and sit in small groups so the students could get a better idea of presentation and service. We were greeted with smiles and they sat us at our tables early.  The environment was welcoming and chic.  The tables are near each other, so you get to see what other patrons are eating.

Furthermore, the waitstaff was very informative and put so much care into their service.  I would say that RPM Italian is a medium plate, as opposed to a small plate, restaurant. Thus, allowing us to to try a few dishes and leaving entirely satisfied.  The staff informed us of the quantities, which opened up the options for an entertaining experience at our table.  We were all able to share our food, while still having a portion to ourselves to thoroughly enjoy. To conclude my review of the staff, I would like to share that they were very professional while still being personable.  Each waiter that came to our table had their own personality.  This says a lot about an establishment and their values.

Now, moving on to the food.  We were so pleasantly surprised by the amount of flavor in each dish.  I do not think it is necessary to describe everything we ate, because I believe everything on the menu is carefully crafted and packed with delicate flavors.  Again, with the portions at a moderate size we were able to have an experience.

Our students were able to get everything they wanted and more.  Many of them said they did not think they would be able to eat out back in Michigan, because it just would not compare.  While we know they are young and have their whole lives to partake in more experiences, this will be one they will not forget.

Thank you again for creating such a memorable experience for all of us.  We all felt like we were treated with respect and it was worth all of the fundraising efforts to be able to have this experience.  Today in class, we asked our students what they got out of the experience.  They unanimously said the customer service was their favorite part.  They really loved the food as well, but they felt like the waitstaff acknowledged them and made them feel like they were a part of something.

Without a doubt, I think we will all be making it back to RPM Italian when the next opportunity presents itself.",1
3280,"Just wanted to give credit to our server Andre (Dre) who made our night extra enjoyable. We dined with our children on Friday evening and he anticipated every need with ease. Even before I had a request out of my mouth the answer was yes, every time. Dre treated our children just as important as if they were adult diners, so important and often missed. Thank you for the excellent service Dre!!",1
3281,"Great Italian experience that's both high end and fun. The restaurant is beautiful and swanky. It's not necessarily a place for kids. More of an adult restaurant, but I suppose older kids would be fine. It's a great date place or site for a business dinner.

Good place to dress up for and to see and be seen!",1
3282,"We were little late getting seated, but the service was excellent otherwise. Knowledgeable and professional wait staff that know how to leave you to enjoy your food.

Dry aged porterhouse and veal chop were excellent as expected. Bone-in cuts can be tricky to get to medium rare, but they got it perfectly. Of course, restaurants of this caliber really should never screw up steaks. Special we also got was little below expectations unfortunately. The pasta was a bit past al dente, and the sauce was a bit monotone. The appetizers were nice though with more complex flavor profiles.

All in all, we enjoyed our dinner here. There aren't that many places where you can get dry aged steaks any more, and the skill level of the kitchen is definitely a cut above typical restaurant. The prices are quite reasonable also.",1
3283,"The atmosphere of this place was very nice! Cool lights and modern music were complimented with friendly staff. The only problem is the food itself. The appetizers were not good and the main portions size was very strange. The food was simply over priced and under impressive for the resturaunt as a whole. Find a different spot, plenty to choose from!",0
3284,"Went here while travelling for business being gluten free it can be hard to find good places to eat. RPM did not disappoint, the best gf pasta I have ever had! They make it in house fresh, not from a box. Highly recommend checking it out! Busy place and long waits so make sure you make a reservation.",1
3285,"This place is awesome!! Took our daughter for her 16th birthday with a couple of her friends and loved the place.
Got the table I requested and they even gave her these cute mini cone ice creams for her birthday!!!
Great food, atmosphere and our waiter Ryan!!!
Will definitely come back....maybe for my birthday at the end of March😉",1
3286,love RPM Italian and now that we live so far away it is a dream come true they ship to us now!!,1
3287,"Probably the best ricotta i've ever had. The gluten free pomodoro pasta was also really good, though small portion size for a pasta dish I cannot complain because the pasta was amazing for GF and everything tasted homemade with high standards of perfection in their prep. Brussel sprout salad is surprisingly refreshing and delicious. The grilled bread is also to die for. Next time, I cannot wait to try one of their desserts. Highly recommend! Does not disappoint.",1
3288,"Maybe its because Thanksgiving.  But I ordered a tea that took a little over 45 mins. They took my silver ware before our main course, never brought them back. Had to ask for a fork to eat with my family. Server was nice.
Food break down. Just main courses.
1 scallops  3 out of 5 not bad had better.
2 mash potatoes  4.5 out of 5 but crazy high salty but flavor was great.
3 stuffing was just wet bread sorry but true.
Squash was good too. My wifes steak was great a d perfect.  I would try the italian food sometime. But wont be back for Thanksgiving.",0
3289,It was a wonderful experience. Absolutely worth it!,1
3290,It was my first visit to RPM. From the appetizers to the main meal to the desert and the drinks I don't think I've had a better meal in the last 15 years. We had probably five appetizers for six of us and everyone was better than the last period for dinner I had the lobster ravioli which was sumptuous. And then I had the hazelnut chocolate dessert and shared with the table. It was a huge hit. I will definitely be back and bring friends.,1
3291,"Heard so many good things about RPM Italian and it was a huge letdown.  Our party ordered several dishes and we all shared.  The pasta my friend ordered wasn't completely cooked, the food overall had a very salty taste.  The portions aren't big and the prices are big. Our friends joked that Olive Garden would've been better--The service was okay and the place did seem clean.  Overall, we will not be going back and came out feeling like the name RPM and its celeb owners is why people really come here.",0
3292,Celebrate my birthday here.  Great service and delicious food. Crowded place but Reservations were not hard to get.  The food portions are not large but we're still filling. Plenty of booth seating. I like the booths it just feels more cozy.  You can also eat by the bar.  They have many bars too.,1
3293,Great service! Walked in late on a Saturday night. No reservation. Got seated right away. Food was outstanding. My date and I had a good time. Will definitely recommend!,1
3294,"We had the best time eating here! We had a reservation for 6 to celebrate my sister's bachelorette weekend. Our server made this experience so fun (If I remember correctly his name was Travis). Everyone enjoyed their drinks, starters, meals, and desserts. If you're looking for a restaurant for a special occasion this one would not disappoint. The portion sizes are smaller and a la carte and not meant for sharing but that's okay because I wanted to eat all of mine!",1
3295,Our favorite RPM restaurant!!,1
3296,"One of my top five fine dining lifetime experiences. Excellent doesn't really do justice in describing the food and the service. It is pricey, but well worth the cost. Highly recommended for a special occasion.",1
3297,"I had booked a table for 9pm on a Thursday night.
The restaurant was exceptionally busy and we had to wait for our table.
I went and sat at an empty table behind the bar.
I was approached by a rude server who thought I was taking up space by sitting there and not ordering anything.
What a cheek !!!  The restaurant didn’t have my table ready on time and god forbid if they expect Me to stand around!!
I am a paying customer and expect to be treated accordingly.
I will sit on any available space and wait for my table and will not put up with arrogant servers who think they own the establishment.
Either the restaurant sticks to the booking time or they make space for customers to wait. They really need to hire courteous servers rather than those who tarnish the company image.
Totally disgusting and will NOT recommend this to any of my friends.
They deserve ZERO STARS.",0
3298,"Great atmosphere, good service, and amazing food! We love trying a new pasta dish each time we come! We always order too much because there are so many good things to choose from,  but it never disappoints! The bisteca is delicious and they are always willing to accommodate two different ways we want it prepared-  medium well for me and rare for my husband...and the season in salt that comes with...! Same as RPM Steak and it’s just the best! Don’t forget to save room for the doughnuts...to die for!! You will be glad you try this place out!!",1
3299,Try the carbonara and the truffle garlic bread. So good.,1
3300,Cold Food and miniature portions.  Food came out late and none of us at the table were able to actually eat our meal together.   Then after the food was delivered late a rude woman that was not our waiter came and told us we were at our time limit and gave us the bill to leave (we still were not done eating our food).  Superior Disappointment to say the least.  None of us will ever eat here again.,0
3301,I took my wife here for her birthday. The food and the service was excellent. Dishes are a little pricey and small. My wife and I just ordered a variety of different dishes and shared everything. The restaurant itself is beautiful. I would recommend this place to anyone if you want to impress someone or want to celebrate a special occasion. I would not recommend eating here everyday. It would be too costly.,1
3302,"Awesome atmosphere but the food is below average. I have owned Italian place, and I am very sensitive with quality and selection in Italian restaurants. This place really disappointed me. It would be 4 stars if it was regular diner in the Suburbs, but it is a modern place in the heart of Chicago, so only 3 stars for not being good enough.",1
3303,"DO NOT PLACE RESERVATIONS! THEY WILL NOT ACCOMMODATE!

I would love to give this place 5 stars because the food is truly Delicious! However, I booked reservations for my boyfriend’s birthday and when we arrived it was complete chaos.

We were told our table would be ready shortly however, we waited about an hour to be seated. I spoke to someone about having to pay for valet. We could’ve parked our car elsewhere in all the time we waited to be seated and they seemed totally dismissive in our concerns for their lack of good service. I noticed many people showing up for their reservations as well and being asked to sit at a fully seated bar in the meantime. Completely inconvenient and just not good service. If you cannot hold your reservations, PLEASE DON’T ALLOW PEOPLE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS! Simple. Honestly, it takes away from the dining experience.",0
3304,"If you can only eat one thing here, make it the ricotta. Not only is it the best ricotta I've ever eaten, but after the first time I had it I literally had a dream about it. Everything from RPM Italian is excellent, including the service. This is definitely a place where you pay for what you get. I tried the risotto with shaved black truffle and that is also a must have. The staff is always friendly and extremely accomodating. I've eaten here several times and there is not a single thing I would even imagine having an issue with.",1
3305,"The restaurant is very nice decorated, the food was excellent from starters to desserts. However, I am giving only 3 stars because we had to wait 45 minutes despite we had a reservation. The waiter was very nice and attentive but I would say also overwhelmed due to the overcrowded place, so we had to ask twice for certain items. If you decide to manage a  fancy no cheap restaurant, you must provide a better attention to clients.",1
3306,"I come to RPM Italian every time while in Chicago. In the past I was helped by stefano and David although I’m not sure if they are still there. Food is always exceptional!!
Unfortunately this was the very first time my experience was spoiled by the service of the waitress Jessica. (Very unfortunate an employee can ruin the image of an entire business) I was still very nice to her and tipped fully.  never made it known that she is really ruining someone’s night.
When we were first sat, she began super strong and friendly. I enjoyed talking with her. We ordered some drinks and apps to start. The apps came out pretty quick. After that she disappeared and didn’t stop by at all. Not to check if we’re doing good or to get our dinner order in! I eventually had to stop another waiter and he instantly took down our order and apologized. Our food came out then Jessica came by to ask if everything is looking good... it was kind of rude to disregard the entire 30 minutes she was away or the fact that someone else had to take our order because she was doing whatever. Not only did she not apologize but continued the very random mood switch. Unsure if something personal happened behind the scenes but some people need to remember you don’t work for free. Your customers pay your check at the end of the day. If you’re not happy to work there the doors wide open. :) won’t be returning here but I would love to try rpm steak or seafood in the future.",1
3307,"Went to a private group event here, amazing service and some of the tastiest food I've ever had.",1
3308,"I am a big fan of RPM Italian and have been there several times. Overall, the food is very good nearly authentic Italian fair. The entry staff could have a little less attitude but that is typical for downtown Chicago restaurants these days. Once inside, service is excellent but just be prepared forA relatively loud environment. Overall highly recommended.",1
3309,"Service was great.  Willing to tell us, in detail, about anything we wanted to know.

Drink was great as well - a bellini.

I had the asparagus, the crispy poached egg, and the Maine lobster ravioli.  The asparagus was great; the crispy poached egg was something interesting and different - good but not fantastic; and the ravioli was also good.

I thought the whole thing was a bit overpriced for the food, but I imagine you're paying for the experience as well.",1
3310,"Small plate style Italian food. I had the most basic items on the menu, but I enjoyed it. The garlic bread appetizer was good, and the spaghetti was cooked as advertised perfectly al dente. I really enjoyed the desert - we ordered this chocolate ball of ice cream that was absolutely delicious.

The dining room is very intimate, and I appreciated how the TVs were turned off during the dinner hour. Service was also friendly. I would likely come back.",1
3311,"Perfect to impress the clients, they do a great job with custom menus, and offers seating for large groups, the food is always incredible",1
3312,"I came here for my birthday dinner in April 2014.  It was a Wednesday, and although we had reservations, we had to wait 45 minutes. Finally we were seated at a high-top table. My 70 year old parents, visiting from out of town, were a bit...let's say...soured.  The staff, however, kept their composure even in the face of elderly attitude.  They offered complimentary champagne, which was very classy, and kept a professional demeanor throughout.  Food was tasty and presentation was lovely.  In a city with a variety of innovative restaurants, not sure it is anything that special to which I would return unless invited.",1
3313,"The Prices were high and portions were small.
The food was not tasty at all.  Pasta was not well cooked and the chicken Parmesan was chewy.
The meat tasted like it had been cooked on the same pan as some type of fish.  It was salty and chewy.
We went to RPM based off the positive reviews And needless to say were expecting the food quality to be at at par with the prices.  Oh boy were we disappointed!!",0
3314,"I’ve been here several times and try to go frequently. Anytime I can make an excuse to go, I do! It’s great food at a nominal price. The pasta is divine and quite inexpensive for the caliber of the restaurant. Now, I’m not saying it’s the absolute best restaurant in the world, but compared to the other items on the menu, even, they’re so cheap! The salads are wonderful as well. I can’t speak to the meat or heavier entrées, but I’m sure I’ll be trying them!",1
3315,Amazing food amazing atmosphere. Just overall 5 stars all the way.,1
3316,"The food was outstanding, but the service was less than stellar. The tables were too close together and people’s backsides were brushing against our table as they were being sat. They asked if we were celebrating and the server didn’t even acknowledge my birthday. We sat with empty glasses of wine and clean plates for 10 minutes. I would have loved another glass of wine, but our server didn’t even ask us if we wanted one. The bus boy cleared the glasses and plates before our server had even been back by. I had been looking forward to this meal for weeks and was super disappointed.",0
3317,"They originally messed up on our reservation  that had us waiting an exorbitant amount of time. But once the manager Mike learned of the issue he quickly fixed it. The food was amazing and made the wait well worth it. The truffle risotto was divine, the steak was chared perfectly, the chicken parmesan was deliciously spicy, but the most incredible dish was the cheesecake. That cheesecake is the best any of us had ever had. To top it off our server Bob was on top of it the entire time making the dinner service flawless.",1
3318,"RPM Italian is one of my favorite restaurants to go to. I recently even celebrated my birthday with my fiancée there in May as well using their Presidential Room. The food, decor, atmosphere is so chic and amazing. She has classic Italian dishes made well and also updated the dishes so they are modern and have an incredible experience. While food and service is usually 5/5, my last experience the meatballs for appetizer were cold. Also, this restaurant is so busy it can be hard to find seating during rush. Otherwise amazing restaurant! Beignets were 10/10 came out warm, fluffy, with powder sugar and chocolate/Nutella thick sauce to dip in. Delectable",1
3319,"Went to RPM after suggestion by a local. We got there early and sat at the bar - the aesthetic has a modern grounded vibe - darker and clean lines. The food was terrific - authentic, fresh, small portions and delicious. We loved the burrata and chicken parm. Interesting spritzers. We are not lovers of Italian wines so would have been nice to have a few other options on the extensive wine list. Sommelier was fantastic. Will go back.",1
3320,"This Italian restaurant has a great variety of different foods from Pasta to Seafood, they all taste amazingly delicious. The great food, the great service, the nice place, and location, what else can you ask for? Their staff is really nice and my daughter enjoyed having a conversation with some of them and that was really of them to entertain all their customers very well.",1
3321,"Absolutely LOVE this place. A D.C. native and the service, atmosphere, and service was as phenomenal as the D.C location. Nicolette was AMAZING. So educated on the menu and made our visit feel so comfortable. She was so attentive and honestly so caring. Would recommend this place to anyone!",1
3322,"Excellent food, but completely overpriced and a little bit pretentious. Also the ""modern"" decor is very close  to being outdated.  There are so many incredible restaurants in River North I don't know why anybody eats here, unless you're into pretentiousness. Or if you'd like to have the option to order a $300 steak and still have to order a side for potatoes or vegetables, then this may be your place.  Really they couldn't throw in a $0.50 potato?",1
3323,"Make sure you make a reservation. Very popular since its opening and known for their impeccable wait staff dressed in white, tailored and very fashionable suit jackets. The food is superb. Start with the oven roasted octopus. It will not disappoint and your party will be impressed at your sense of foodie adventurous style. Pair it with the truffle garlic bread.  Enough to share for a table of 6. For your main course, there are plenty of options from seafood, pastas, and a variety of wood fired grilled steaks. Bottles of wine range from 40-1,000's.  Sides are big enough to share. I recommend the fire grilled asparagus. Finish with a latte and chocolate sorbetto.  A must when in Chicago.",1
3324,You'll definitely want a reservation as even on a weeknight there will be a wait. We got an excellent wine recommendation and the food was fantastic. They also have a gluten free menu if anyone in your party needs which includes gluten free pasta options. I had the beef and park ragu on cavatelli and savored every bite.,1
3325,"So I attended RPM this past June for my Birthday Dinner and overall the experience was nice. I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant the staff was fairly nice, I guess . They accommodating my table of 16 and was put into what I assume was the catering room. However the food was not so good. I ordered the “Mama DePandi's Bucatini“ it was cold and chewy as if it was over cooked it actually tasted pretty horrible like a can of “spaghettos”, I also ordered  the Pizza and the crust was burnt, 2 out of 16 guest enjoyed their food everyone else was disappointed. I was so unhappy with the Choice I made for my birthday dinner because obviously the FOOD is the most important part. Will I go back ummm maybe maybe not.",1
3326,"Tough review to write because normally I love RPM. I’ve come here on girls nights, date nights, for my birthday, etc. This was my first time coming as a mom with my little guy. Now I realize this is RPM, not Chuck-e-cheese, but all customers should feel welcome, even moms. There was no changing table in either the women’s or men’s restroom. I had to sit on the floor in the bathroom and change my son. Not exactly what you anticipate from a restaurant that puts that much thought into ambience. Put some thought into accommodations for parents who visit, please.",1
3327,"Two Updates at the end of this.
Today my rating is a low 3 because, this time the Spaghetti and big meatball that I’ve been ordering for years came to the table with very little taste, whole garlics, and watered down! Maybe this time the Chef got fed up that someone at our table asked for no Chili flakes in their spaghetti, which caused the other 2 spaghetti dinners to have NO chili flakes in there’s at all! (Which was an incorrect order) Hopefully this restaurant isn’t going down hill on service. One last comment, if you’re bringing a party of 8 expect to be seated at their small tables that ‘they say’ should fit 8 people, it doesn’t! I asked the hostess for a bigger table and was told that the bigger table for ten is only reserved for special events but, I guess can accommodate 10+guests for dinner (pretty much Too Bad) so,
we suffered through with the small uncomfortable table! (You would need to inquire for accuracy on what the hostess told me regarding a bigger table) We were all average sized adults and had a very uncomfortable dinner experience sitting at their table for 4 or 6 when we had 8! Please, your restaurant has space (in the aisle) to afford a couple of bigger tables to accommodate the parties of 8 adults! I realize space is at a premium so, it’s comes down to business, that you would rather get more people in the restaurant that making it a more comfortable experience. I couldn’t wait for dinner to be over with and get out of there! I’ve been enjoying this restaurant for many years but, will not make a reservation there again when I'm taking a bigger party out for dinner.
Business is Business.

UPDATE: The Manager called me to discuss my review, he was GREAT and we will definitely be going back there! I’m looking forward to having their Spaghetti and Big Meatball dinner along with their amazing garlic bread! This place continues to amaze me!
UPDATE: We did go back for dinner. The restaurant was full of excitement and gave off a great vibe!
We decided to sit at the bar like we randomly do, which NEVER lacks service nor comfort. We all had the spaghetti and big meatball (the BEST around) along with the delicious garlic bread to top it off! We had an amazing time and looking forward to going back soon to one of our favorite restaurant in all of Chicago!
Thanks again!!",1
3328,"Best Italian restaurant in the city! The food is so rich, solid wine list, yummy cocktails, and most plates are tapas style. Love the decor. Every time I am there, I always enjoy the experience. Try the gnocchi lobster dish!",1
3329,"Great wait staff, great food. Loved the Prime Rib meatballs! Filet Mignon, and Chicken parmesan the best.  Mashed potatoes decadent/rich.  Great crab appetizers.  Didn't care much for the Bucatini.  The mini gelato cones for dessert were wonderful.  Will be back several more times!",1
3330,"Literally some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Everything was so flavorful and beautifully presented. Guiliana's Italian salad was FULL of flavor and variety, the rosemary focaccia had an amazing texture and flavor (crunchy but soft). The meatballs were great with a sweet tomato basil sauce, and last but not least... the short ribs pasta bolognese was to die for. Literally did not have one bad thing here tonight.
While it's pricey, as the saying goes... you get what you pay for. I would definitely come here again!",1
3331,"Very romantic space. The service was great and the food was spectacular! The truffle garlic bread is so addicting, probably the best garlic bread I have had. We also ordered Guiliannas Italian Salad, the prosciutto tortaloni, gnocchi with sausage and kale, RPM steak, mashed potatoes, and crispy brussel sprouts. The only this is the steak was just okay kind of a tough cut everything else was great!",1
3332,Delicious short rib Bolognese,1
3333,"Went there while visiting Chicago, the food was absolutely delicious, seriously I was impressed by the quality of every dish.. I had ricotta and the pasta carbonara with the wine advised by the waiter and it was very tasty. The service was excellent, the waiter super nice: my espresso arrived slightly late and he took it off the bill. Strongly recommended!!",1
3334,"We ordered via GrubHub and the two items (king crab bruschetta and lobster caprice) didn't make the trip. The portion size was crazy small. The cannoli was a little bigger than a chapstick. The taste was good, not great... If it had been double the portion size it would not of been as bad.",0
3335,"My wife and I set an early reservation, highly recommended to plan ahead as this place gets busy. The service here is finely tuned and very detail just right. Recommend the spaghetti and meatballs as well as short rib bolognese. We had an apple salad which was incredible but a bit small portion. Altogether a perfect experience and I'll visit again soon!",1
3336,"Great service for a private hosted gathering. Staff was very pleasant, knowledgeable of their cuisines, and of the area in general. Food was good overall, lots of different choices, but no one thing we tried set them apart from other similar restaurants of the same cuisine offerings.",1
3337,"Had a fantastic business dinner here. The dining room is lovely,  and it was more lively than I expected for a Wednesday night!   The service was great,  and the food was delicious. Everything was high quality and presented well.",1
3338,"Visiting Chicago for the first time was overwhelming due to all the restaurant options available. RPM Italian is a great choice for great Italian food. Being Italian, I am very picky when I eat at Italian restaurants because I love the taste of authentic food. I had squid for appetizer and risotto for my main and it did not disappoint. The restaurant does get quite busy on a Saturday, so expect a crowd and an louder atmosphere. You will most likely be sitting very close to another table as well. I would definitely come back here if I were to visit Chicago again.",1
3339,"Fantastic surprise!  Superb service and excellent food.  Very well prepared dishes coupled with perfect wine selections, courtesy of the on staff sommelier.  Our meal began with steak tartare and cremini mushroom pizzini.  Wonderful chanterelle risotto, crispy brusells sprouts and a perfectly cooked steak served as the main dishes.  The meal was rounded out by an Italian dessert similar to beignets; bombalonis.  Our server, Chelsea was exceptional.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
3340,"The wait/availability situation at RPM is flat out annoying, but our experience was worth it.  I was very hesitant as it takes months to get a reservation, but I was really pleased.

We ordered the ricotta toast, the carbonara and the meatballs.  Everything was standout.  The only annoying part was our waiter, who continued to recommend the most expensive things on the menu (typical) and kept asking us every five minutes if we wanted to order more.  I get it, but it became a little much.

I would go back and order exactly the same - it was that good!  There is a reason for the wait and availability - definitely a wonderful choice.",1
3341,"I was there Monday the 8th for my birthday and it was truly the best experience. My server was Dre, and honestly he should be in charge of training all servers everywhere. He was so knowledgeable about everything,  made sure that my birthday experience was a great one, all while hyping up his fellow servers and making sure their tables also had a great experience. I'll definitely be back and hope to get sat in his section again.",1
3342,"This restaurant has a great selection of southern-stye food and beer. The shrimp & Grits and the Piglet Platter are both excellent examples of ""down-home"" style food. The portions are huge and the service was excellent! We will be back to sample more excellent food.",1
3343,"The first time I finally got to try RPM Italian I had the assumption that I would be unimpressed. I expected a trendy Italian place instead of something authentic. Wow, was I wrong all around. To this day RPM remains at the top of my list in terms of impressing me all around.

Initially upon walking into the restaurant I absolutely love the atmosphere and decor. It's definitely trendy but it's so chic and welcoming, too. I was further impressed with the food and cocktails. I really enjoyed the flatbread, side of potatoes, and the eggplant parmesan to name a few.

But what blew my experience out of the water was the amazing service. It was by far probably the best service I have ever received or witnessed. Everyone was working together and helping each other including the manager. It was clearly a team and they worked together like a well-oiled machine. I was quite impressed and look forward to returning.",1
3344,"Edit: 3/19/18 from 2 stars to 4 stars. RPM reached out to us and encouraged us to come back and try their restaurant again. On our second visit, we had a much better experience. We were seating right on time for our reservation, the table was prepared properly, service was great, and food was excellent again. It seems that our first visit here was simply a fluke. If our second visit was our first, I would have rated RPM Italian 5 stars. I do highly recommend that you try here if you're looking for an Italian date night or business dinner. The 500-day prosciutto was to die for.

__________________________________________________

Let me start off by saying the food was excellent here: We had the stuffed peppers, focaccia bread, eggplant parmesan, and the lobster ravioli. However, we had three issues with our visit, -1 star for each.

1. We had reservations for 8:30pm, but we were not seated until 8:55pm. We had a show to catch afterward, so this added additional stress to our evening.

2. When we were seated, one of the seats we were given had pasta on the seat. Luckily I noticed, but if I didn't my pants would have gotten stained.

3. Portions were small. While the ravioli was very tasty, we only got 6 average sized ravioli. Appetizer-size for a non appetizer price.",1
3345,One of the best restaurants in Chicago! This place is always packed and has a great vibe! The food and the staff is great! I have a gluten Allergy and they do a great job at taking care of me and giving me a wide variety of gluten free options. They also have an awesome bar and cocktail scene! Must go!,1
3346,"I'm giving this place 3 stars only because it didn't live up to the hype surrounding it.  I thought the food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  If anything, the marinara sauce on the meatballs was too salty and I love salt.  For a place that's impossible to get a weekend reservation for, I had high expectations and it just didn't ""wow"" me.",1
3347,"Food was ok, although the pasta portion size was too small but they did warn us about the small portion size. The things I didn’t like was more on the service side. We were only 10 mins early but we were asked to wait until the time of our reservation, although see empty tables all around (it was lunch time), service was very slow, although over server was very nice, it took them 40 mins to get two pastas. Also, this wasn’t the best italian I had, like most other talk about this place. Volare on grand and st clair is far better",1
3348,"I have been to RPM Italian many times. I have never been disappointed and have always thoroughly enjoyed every meal at RPM Italian. Of most importance to me, the food and the service has remained at an extremely high level over the years. Based on the consistency of the food, the service, the fabulous wine list (and the extremely helpful and knowledgeable Sommeliers), and the ambiance, I am given 5-star status for RPM Italian.",1
3349,Excellent food at a trendy spot! Plan well in advance if you are interested in coming here on a weekend. It books up fast. It is worth it through. It’s a great place for a special occasion and it’s part of the Lettuce Entertain You brand. I love their budino and it’s gluten-free!,1
3350,"To see and to be seen, this is one of those places, but with great food too.  My biggest complaint about this place was the SMALL portion sizes and the BIG prices attached to them. If price is not an issue, then you will love RPM.  Desserts and coffee were amazing too-which to me, says a lot about a restaurant.

Food, was delicious and went above my expectations.  Bill and Giuliana know what they're doing!",1
3351,"Really good food, but small portions. The carbonara was amazing, it was creamy and full of flavors. The ravioli was good even though it came out a bit cold. The artichokes were amazing too!
The desert was really good. We had the italian icecreams and the homemade donuts which came out delicious.
Overall it was a good experience.",1
3352,"We ate at RPM steak the night before. This isn’t as flashy but the food is A++. Outstanding dishes and we got basically the whole menu. I have spent years perfecting the spaghetti carbonara and I think mine is damn near perfect and this one topped it without question. Classic, delicious, and oh so perfect",1
3353,"Overrated- okay Italian food, wasn't blown away considering the popularity. Our reservation was at 6:45 and we weren't seated until almost 7:30. The rest of the night went equally as slowly, so we were afraid to order dessert and have to wait around even longer.
Great wine list at least.",1
3354,"We had the most amazing meal and service during our trip to Chicago. We had Jessica as our server and she made our experience exceptional. She was informative and attentive. The food I would give it a 5/5 as well. We had squid ink pasta, Bolognese, & carbonara (not bad compared to other restaurants) and some delicious sides (mushrooms and brussel sprouts).",1
3355,"Portions were on the small side. Pasta and sauce were very good. Too much sauce, not enough pasta. Disappointed with the limited pasta offerings. Service was ok. RPM Steak is definitely better on all accounts.",1
3356,"At the behest of one of our friends, my travel-mates and I quickly made a reservation just a couple of days before our Atlanta departure to RPM Italian, Bill and Guiliana Rancic's restaurant pre-covid. There was a mild wait for our table upon arrival, but we were promptly seated approximately 15 minutes after our reservation time. Interior decor was simple, but luxurious.

We ordered a medley of things. For apps, we got Peppered Beef Carpaccio, Wood Roasted Octopus, and Big Eye Tuna Bruschetta. Our mains were Sweet Corn Agnolotti, Spicy King Crab Pasta, and Spaghetti and Meatball. Lastly for dessert, Hazelnut Tartufo, and their ""Tiramisu"". For beverages, I had an Old Fashioned and one of my travel-mates ordered an RPM Mule. Everything was DELICIOUS. You can not go wrong with any of the menu items here. I'm currently craving my dish of choice, the Sweet Corn Agnolotti. It's topped off with shavings of truffle and basil. Truffle wasn't overwhelming and was just the right amount. The agnolotti melts in your mouth. I heavily recommend this dish.",1
3357,We came here for dinner a couple weeks ago and had a terrific experience. The cocktails and wine were excellent and the food was delicious. It was some of the best Italian food I’ve had in a while. I would definitely recommend a visit!,1
3358,"Came here to celebrate my husband and my birthdays. I was really looking forward to our meal...but found everything to be just ok. Our appetizers were the best part, would recommend the octopus 100%. My pancetta wrapped cod which was recommended by the waitress was not fantastic. It was a piece of cod wrapped in crispy pancetta then placed in clam chowder. Therefore the bottom of the pancetta was soggy. I was also very surprised as they did not do anything special for our birthday celebration. I saw the two tables next to us have dessert brought out with a candle and even heard the waitress inform them the dessert was on the house. Ours had no candle and was very much not complimentary. We had no problem paying for the dessert, I was just kind of let down. Two people recommended this restaurant to us during our time in Chicago, truthfully, we won’t be back. Plenty of other places in this city to spend money for better food.",1
3359,"Let me set the scene. Book a flight 3 months out to have a girls/trip/reunion. We all pack nice dresses/heels in our economy backpacks with the expectation that it will be a really nice dinner. Get to dinner with an 8pm reservation, wait 20 mins to get seated. Once seated the service was friendly but slow. Meatballs literally tasted like they came out of a can of chef boyardee. Ricotta and ciabatta toast was ok. Caesar salad was meh, and the pasta...  what do I say. It was actually embarrassing how gross it was and we had a bite of everything and nothing else. Finished the night with a bowl of queso because we were still hungry post dinner. Don’t go here.
Update: I was contacted by management who was very concerned in making sure everything was right which I appreciate.",0
3360,"My daughter and her friend wanted spaghetti for dinner, this place had great reviews. We ordered (a $21 plate of spaghetti + $10 for delivery, tip, tax).
My daughter waited in the hotel lobby for the delivery man, but he went to the desk, dropped it off and left without saying what room it was for (yes, we put the room # in the delivery instructions)...30 minutes later she asked the front desk if any food had been delivered, and they gave it to her, apologizing, stating the gentleman didn’t leave a room number.
She opened it and was surprised at the portion of food you receive for $21...they tried the spaghetti and it was spicy (?!), so I tried it. The garlic and other spices used were indeed quite spicy!
They may have a lovely establishment (I haven’t been there in person so can’t speak to this), but for our particular experience and to make a long story short, it’s over priced, over seasoned, the meatball-though a very good size was under cooked or best described as ‘doughy’ or ‘fleshy’ on the inside. This is the first 1 star review I’ve ever left.
Not a great Taste of Chicago :(",0
3361,"I don't want to over sell it, but this place was out of this world. We wisely trusted our server (Shane C.) To choose the food for us, we told him what we didn't like and he did the rest. I love when you can trust the server, what they do is an art, not a job. Bravo!",1
3362,Delicious food with several options for vegetarians in addition to the omnivores in your group. They have a huge wine menu for any interested vinos with sommeliers available to help sort through their options. The atmosphere is very intimate butt my only issue was that the music was very loud making conversation difficult within our large group.,1
3363,"Great Italian place. Everything we had was at least very good, some of it excellent. Drinks were great. ""This is NOT a Margarita"" was tasty and, yes, tasted like an excellent margarita. Standard old fashioned was one of the best we've had even though it was made with ""just"" Buffalo Trace. Best bowl of spaghetti and meatballs we've ever had. Which is weird to say, I know. But the sauce was light but not watery and had the right amount of red pepper in it. Squid ink pasta with king crab was very delicious. The beef tartare was interesting (served on mini grilled cheese sandwiches instead of something like bruschetta). Tasty, but in the end I wanted to eat the meat by itself as the cheese got a little distracting. Serving sizes of pasta are perfect if you want to enjoy an appetizer and dessert as they are not huge. Desserts were actually quite large and delicious. The hazelnut ice cream in the tartufo was excellent. The chocolate torta was about what you'd expect, though having the candied orange instead of berries was a nice change from what I'm used to. Service was great. Four stars because, honestly, most of the time you go to a good Italian place it's gonna be great; it's hard for one to *truly* be amazing.",1
3364,"Interesting to read so many positive reports on the food.  We wish we could have experienced it.  We felt lucky at making a late booking call and getting a table for two at 9.45pm.  We arrived early and loved the edgy ID, noisy buzz and atmosphere.  We had planned on aperitifs at the bar and settled in. At 10.00pm we enquired about our table and were curtly told ""we're busy and running late"".  At 10.10pm we were escorted to 6 seat table as it was the only one available. A waiter appeared with menus and effused on how he was going to look after us personally and promptly disappeared.  10 minutes later we knew the menu off by heart and were understandably getting fed up.  To be honest I've seen far better menus; this one was uninspiring and overpriced.  We gave up after waiting way too long and left for somewhere else.  Not impressed at all.",0
3365,"Some of the BEST food I have ever had. We came in on a busy Saturday night and decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was friendly, chatty, and recommended some of the best dishes. We started with drinks, I highly suggest the Spritz and Giggles, it was handcrafted and a very sweet drink. The crab bruschetta was so savory, I wish we had ordered two plates worth. The butternut squash agnolotti entree was filling, and was great with chicken added to it. We finished with dessert, the bomboloni, the house made nutella was to die for. I highly suggest seeking out this Chicago treasure any time you're in town, we will definitely stop back the next time we are in town.",1
3366,"Simply the best restaurant I have ever been in Chicago.

Their pasta dishes are amazing!!

I had a lobster ravioli which was the best ever. So tasty that I wish they had larger portions :)

My wife had a pasta carbonara and again, she said it was the best carbonara she ever had.

We were really happy with our visit at RPMs.",1
3367,"Carbonara is to die for, one of the best I have ever had.  Bone in rib eye is great too. Definitely recommend tip anyone in town in need of a great dinner.  Friendly staff as well, always a plus!",1
3368,"Maine Lobster Ravioli is delicious and very rich. Highly recommend. Took off a couple stars because the portions are extremely small for the price.  The ravioli entree consisted of 8 half dollar size ravioli. If you like amber beers, I would recommend the anchor steam.",1
3369,The staff provides excellent service and great interpretation of the menu.  The chicken parmesan and eggplant parmesan were the best we've had anywhere.  I would highly recommend RPM Italian.,1
3370,"The food is absolutely delicious. The appetizers are substantial. The entrees do not come in the largest portions, however the flavor that they contain is astonishing. Very reasonably priced. This place has a comfortable and cozy atmosphere with friendly and helpful service.",1
3371,"Top quality: Great spot. The pasta is excellent, and everything else we ordered was tasty too. The service and atmosphere are in-line with the price level. Worth making reservations early as it gets very busy even during the week.",1
3372,"Busy spot for sure. I was with a work group where we shared two courses family-style and had a main each. The eggplant parmigiana was ok, but far too cheesy and a little soggy for me (nothing beats Mum’s parmigiana right?). Donuts and Nutella for dessert were super good.",1
3373,"Appetizers were great....charcuterie platter, zucchini,  crab toast, grilled Octopus.  Salads are a bit small.  Specialty pasta was good (prosciutto tortellini....cooked a bit more al dente than I like).  Entree was good - black sea bass...the main problem was service.  It was a Sunday birthday lunch celebration that lasted for 4 hours- far beyond the time of parking meters for most guests.  Not sure what was going on, but RPM might want to staff a little heavier for large party days like this.  Reservations for 8 were made well in advance.",1
3374,Atmosphere and food were delicious! Our server was outstanding and attentive. Great place to dine! They had valet parking and a secure coat room. I will be returning!,1
3375,"Here's my  recent experience at RPM Italian September 26, 2020.

I arrived  in the front area between 2 patio areas for a $150 pick-up order which I curated to celebrate my anniversary.

I asked a manager, Mike, for pick up area. As he saw me struggling to enter through a locked front area vestibule door, he instructed me that the area I should go is in the back, past outdoor dining customers in the last door at the end of the restaurant. I entered to find a kitchen, and quickly exited thinking I made a mistake. Again, walking past diners I was re-directed back to the kitchen by another staff member who saw me exit the kitchen. Once I entered and was well into their kitchen with dirty dishes, I was informed by one of the kind kitchen staff that I should have been allowed to enter through the front and that this was only for delivery drivers.

My question is does RPM Italian assume all people are picking up orders for delivery (despite a robust online interface designed for patrons to walk in [through the front door])?

Or does RPM Italian reserve these assumptions for the black patrons of color like myself?

Sincerely,
Diminished Patron",0
3376,"I genuinely enjoy this place, and after my first visit I was itching to go back. With that said, I feel it's much better suited for a girls night than a romantic date night. The decor is very sleek and modern. Everything is black and white. The music is not romantic or what you'd picture in an old school Italian restaurant - think more club/lounge. Everything from the cocktails and food to the service were spectacular. The homemade pastas were a slam dunk (we had squid ink pasta with spicy crab, boar ragu, and one other I can't recall). The homemade ricotta is fresh and light. The one thing I'd skip is the cheese stuffed peppers app. The cheese is not melted, but rather just a cube of cheese inside a pepper. Good, but not great. The lobster caprese was incredible as well. Definitely worth a try!",1
3377,"Wow! This place was so good! I had the tacu tacu and it was fantastic. I'm not a fan of cilantro, so I'll have to ask them to leave it out of the rice next time. However, the dish was still incredible, and you've got to love fried plantains!",1
3378,"Incredible service, delicious food! I have Celiac disease and have to be extremely careful where I dine when I’m traveling. The server went above and beyond to accommodate me. They have a separate menu containing all GF items, and they notify the kitchen of your food “allergy” to have the chefs separately prepare your dishes. My food was all signed off on by one of the chefs before it arrived at my table. 100% will be visiting again!",1
3379,Andre provided excellent service!,1
3380,"Delicious food, great ambience, awesome staff. Thanks for a memorable evening! I was hosting business partners and everything was top notch.",1
3381,"Very good food, but a little too LA for me. Seemed like they care more about turning tables then letting you feel comfortable.  Earpieces on everyone. Assistant managers playing on tablets marking progress instead of seeing if you need something. Pay for bread at an Italian restaurant?  Not the Chicago I know.",1
3382,"So overrated. Tiny portion sizes and food is meh. Tried the garlic bread appetizer as it had rave reviews on yelp. Nothing to write home about. I had the crispy roast chicken — dried, flavorless on a bed of tomato and onion ragout.  $24?  Seriously?  And my wife had the scallops. $32 or $8 for each of the 4.  We split the Brussels sprout salad and ate only a quarter of it as it was essentially a bed of raw shredded Brussels sprouts.  Gave it two stars for the personable wait staff. One star for the overpriced low quality food. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere as Chicago has too many good options to choose from.  I think this is the worst food experience for the dollar I’ve ever had at a downtown restaurant and am perplexed where these high ratings are coming from.",0
3383,"Wasn’t as impressed by the food as I’d hoped, but it was still delicious. Ambiance is low lit and cool.",1
3384,"Very extensive, but probably one of the better meals I've had in my lifetime. They had white truffles available to put on anything. The steak and scallops we had were cooked with a perfect sear.",1
3385,I was looking for a good place to take my girlfriend out to dinner on Christmas eve when were were staying in the city. This place was phenomenal. The food was incredible and the service i received was spectacular. I would recommend this to place to anyone looking for good quality food and service. The atmosphere was just perfect.,1
3386,"Without a doubt the best service I’ve ever had at a restaurant.  From our server, Robert, to the food runners, beverage manager, other staff and management. Been here twice now and it is well worth it. Food is excellent but the service is over the top and makes this place one of the best restaurants.  If you want to eat great food at a place where the staff make you feel like a VIP this is the place. Every time I visit Chicago we come here",1
3387,"Sexy steakhouse in Chicago... Felt like I stepped in the 1930s during prohibition. Service was great, portion sizes were good. Drinks were amazing one of the best Old Fashions I have had. Must Order: Chicago Cut Rib Eye, Mashed Potatoes and Duck Terrine",1
3388,Amazing food and service at this restaurant!!! The food was great quality and such large portions!!,1
3389,"Great place for Italian food. Location is close to most of major poi, so it's nice to stop by. The service is very cool and they usually take care of everything with a smile. Food is amazing! Can't fail!",1
3390,"Live RPM, Where the wait staff and the Sommelier went out of their way, above and beyond, to see that I got the wine I wanted. They went over to their State Street location to get some bottles of the rare, Sinegal, that us hard to get anywhere! Did bless em.",1
3391,"RPM Italian had quite a few tasty dishes! It's hard to say that it's top of the line when it comes to fine Italian dishes but taking into consideration both the restaurant's capacity and reasonable price point, I can't complain. Our experience was made that much better by a kind and patient server who recommended excellent wines and passionately deconstructed the menu. Bon appetit!",1
3392,"The theme of the night was ""good, but not amazing"" -- except for dessert. Everything we ate was decent, but nothing really stood out as exceptional, especially after all of the Italian restaurants I've eaten at. Pasta plates are on the smaller side, which also lets you try several instead of having to decide on one. The prime beef meatballs were good, but again, not much flavor. The chicken parm was a good choice as it  was tender and had a bit more flavor. Now to dessert -- delicious! If you like chocolate, definitely order the chocolate torta. It's a huge portion and has a  perfectly blended mix of flavors and textures.",1
3393,"A beautiful atmosphere - that’s romantic but *not* too dark - with a menu that takes elements from both modern and classic Italian cuisines. Near the red line and some metered parking is available. Portion sizes are good, too!",1
3394,One of the best additions to the River North dining scene this year.  Lobster Caprese and Mama DiPandi's pasta are both delicious dishes.  The desserts are excellent as well.  Very popular so expect to make a reservation pretty far out.  Very chic decor and draws a fantastic crowd,1
3395,"Amazing. Everything about our experience, from the host greeting us at the door to the busser bussing our table. One of the most enjoyable experiences I have had. Our server was extremely knowledgeable, explained the dishes in great detail and guided us throughout the entire experience.

There were 8 of us and we shared a lot of delicious items. Surprisingly, the shreddred brussel sprout and avocado salad was one of my favorites. Light and refreshing with a powerful flavor. Also loved the carbonara and cavatelli.

Will absolutely return the next time I am in town.",1
3396,Amazing food! The service was phenomenal. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend!,1
3397,We love RPM Italian! The food is delicious and the place is very nice. Servers that have served us have been wonderful. The prices are good. You will find yourself having a fabulous 5 stat dinner at a value price.,1
3398,"I went here for my first time for my birthday. I  had a very good time. The food was delicious-- just let me tell you they are very small portions. I was definitely taken back by this because going to an italian restaurant you would think the portions would be bigger. My friend and I all split the plates-- which was a big mistake. The plates are definitely for only one person. Highly recommend the food though-- we got lobster ravilioli, pepperoni pizza and some small cheese/meat plates. I definitely think you are paying more for the experience though.",1

3400,"We loved our dinner at RPM Italian. Dont be fooled the pasta dishes are quite large and sufficient for an entree especially if you get an appetizer and dessert. The prosciutto was so good, melted in your mouth. Pasta was delicious, but I think our favorite was the more traditional meat and red sauce. Do not leave without getting the pistachio gelato, still dreaming about it!",1
3401,"We have been to RPM several times over the last few years.  never with a reservation and never had to wait more than 30 minutes which is pretty good for a good restaurant in the city of Chicago.

The service is outstanding. Although we usually find ourselves sitting at the bar (which is cool if you want to talk to people) we have also sat at the tables.  Did not matter much as it was always good service.

Food here is small plates so ordering several and sharing is the way to go. I tried the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio for the first time last time. Thought it was tasty. Salads are always good. However the star of the show are the pastas. We have tried them all and they are all outstanding. The Cavatelli and the short rib bolognese I dream about

Definitely a must go to place.",1
3402,"This was my second time at RPM, the first being two/three years ago...equally great.
Stopped in with a girlfriend after a night of barhopping in the area for one last cocktail. We managed to nab two seats at the packed bar. This was a Sunday night around 7...the place was a zoo!!!
If you like trendy, beautiful restaurants, and trendy, beautiful people watching ( yes to both right here🙄), then this is the place for you. We spend some time trying to decide who is better looking here...the patrons or the staff, and finally call it a draw.
We order some kind of trendy, beautiful cocktail off the fun list...it's awesome. After a glance at the food menu, we decided we have room to split the spaghetti carbonara.
We sit back and enjoy the scene, which is a cross between a restaurant and a Vegas night club?
A short time later, a GQ model brings our carbonara, which is served ( I'm assuming?) authentically with the egg still whole in the middle. He then mixes it for us, creating the freshest, creamiest, lightest sauce I have ever encountered in my entire life. The pasta was cooked perfectly.
My friend was laughing at me...I'm not a big eater..two bites and I'm full...and I was battling her for more.
Bottom line...the place is loud...it's expensive (but it's Chicago, stay home if you don't want to spend money, just know what to expect!!), and it's obnoxiously crowded...and I can't wait to go back.
Word to the wise? If you want to sit in the restaurant... make a reservation!!!!",1
3403,"The food was delicious and the staff knowledgeable and friendly.  As I expected, the portions were adequate and the prices high.",1
3404,"Very hipster/trendy type of place. Figure $100 for two people each getting one drink. My wife really enjoyed the food, as did I, but portions were a bit small for my liking. Service was top notch.",1
3405,We went for my husband’s birthday.  The server was great and gave us good recommendations.  I would plan ahead as it’s always busy. The food was outstanding! Can’t wait to go back!,1
3406,"First time going to RPM. Let me say, the food was amazing! It was the kind of menu where you can't decide because everything looked so good! Ambiance was awesome & Service was great. I think I found my new favorite restaurant!",1

3408,"RPM has been our go-to, fine-dining spot fo a couple of years.  We took advantage of an opportunity for an early dinner on a Friday.  We were celebrating my wife's retirement. Our waiter, Bobby really made our experience special. The lobster ravioli appetizer was very nice. I had the slow roasted Bershire pork, wow. My wife had the chicken (I had a leftover piece on Saturday). This place is consistently great.",1
3409,"On of the best meals I had in Chicago; burrata was incredible and the lobster ravioli just perfect
The restaurant is beautiful and service is good. My only complain was the air conditioner that was set too cold
I recommend you to make reservations; waiting list can get to 2 hours",1
3410,"The best. Food always spectacular, staff always ready to accommodate any needs. I can be one of those ""special"" customers and they always go above and beyond for me. Wine has also been a highlight for us.",1
3411,"We had a reservation on a Sunday at 8pm . Checked in and told them we were celebrating our 19th anniversary and  requested a booth , the hostess was very short and let us know it would be a longer wait for a booth so we declined and said we would just take  the first available. We found a seat at the crowded bar for a drink but ended up just eating there . The food was ok .... nothing special . We had a drink and ate then left.  They texted us at 9:00pm that our table was ready ! This place is over rated for sure !!!!!",0
3412,"Truly loved the food here!! We had the red peppers with cheese and warm bread with lardo as appetizers! Soooo good! I wasn't sure about eating something called ""Lardo"" but it was the most flavorful oil /butter and I loved it. I even added it to my brussel sprouts! For dinner I got a butternut squash ravioli with added crab meat 🦀. It was wonderful! Will definitely come back!",1
3413,"We came back as promised the second time and left as a happy customer.
Food and service was great. Thank you for making up. This was a special Birthday occasion. The staff went above and beyond to make it awesome experience.",1
3414,"Food was excellent.  Our server Jackie was great as well.  I went with some people from work while we visited Chicago.  They went the last time and raved about it.  RPM didn't disappoint.  Next time we get the chance, I'm sure we'll go back.",1
3415,"Made reservations for a Sunday evening after hearing great reviews about this place.

The ambiance is super fun and trendy - great place to grab food before a night out on the town. The service was exceptional, prompt and friendly. Definitely allowed us to have such a positive experience here.

Food:
Truffle Garlic Bread - soooo good. Ask for a side of the pomodoro sauce as well.
Burrata w/ Figs - also soooo freaking good. So good, we asked for more figs...

Entrees, were great portions, but definitely consider family style and sharing in order to try a bit of everything.
- Bucatini w/ Diablo sauce - we were looking for a kick to the sauce and this nailed it. While i'm not a huge fan of the bucatini pasta itself, I really loved the sauce.
- Spicy King Crab - this didn't hit spicy on my tastebuds, but the crab was solid. The squid ink seemed a little dry to me, but it was my first time trying this type of pasta - so I could be totally wrong on this.
- Eggplant Parmesan - FAVORITE!! This freaking veggie plate stole the show for all of us, even carnivores at the table. It was so gooey hot and crispy. You have to be sure to order this dish and share. It'll be worth your while
- Prosciutto Tortellini - another solid dish, really really good flavors and probably the best prosciutto flavors i've had in quite a while.

For dessert you have to order the hazelnut tartufo. Think ferrero rocher with gelato ice cream inside. so. freaking. good.

Overall, such a great restaurant, food and service. I'd be back in a heartbeat the next time we are in town!!",1
3416,"This is a great restaurant for anyone looking for a classy meal downtown chicago. The decor is fabulous, the food is great, and the deserts are a must. Recommended by two of the friendliest waiters, David and Brittney made sure I was taken care of and enjoyed the greatest deserts. There is this large chocolate covered ice cream ball (forgot the name!) but just ask for it and they should point in the right direction to one of the tastiest deserts ever!",1
3417,Good food and good selection of Italian cuisine. Non of the dishes stood out but the squid ink pasta. The authentic Italian kitchen is meant to be simple and uncomplicated. Value for money is not there.,1
3418,We did not have a reservation so planned to sit at the bar.  We were pleasantly surprised to find out that the entire bar area was open seating.  We had excellent service from Jacqui B.  Would have been impressed with the service if we had a reservation and were not seated in the bar area.  Food was good and reasonably priced.  Nice find for out of towners.,1
3419,One of the best meals I've ever had. My wife and I got a little of everything and all were amazing. The ricotta crostini app was delicious and the cannolis  were amazing. The service was excellent as well. Not a bad dish on the menu.,1
3420,"The food here is amazing! I recommend the Steak Grigliata, the Carbanora and the Short Rib Bolognese! I also appreciated the service I received because I proposed to my fiancee here! What a memorable experience! I can't wait to visit this restaurant again in the city where it all began.",1
3421,"My sister and I decided to visit RPM upon our first visit to Chicago, we weren't disappointed!! Our waiter, Anthony was very hospitable, and he explained the menu throughly.
Being a vegetarian, I consider myself an eggplant parmesan connoisseur. Delicious!!
The bartenders and hostess  could have been a tad more personable,  but our waiter and the food had me overlooking it.",1
3422,"This place is a great Italian spot. I wasn't aware of it initial till I got invited there. Food is superb, service is great, and restaurant ambiance is on point. Can be a causal or formal spot. Great of small groups of 4-5. Definitely worthy of coming back...thats a good sign. Get the chicken parm 🤤",1
3423,Amazing happy hour Monday - Friday. Delicious appetizers and drinks in a really classy atmosphere. 10/10 would recommend. The squid ink pasta and carbonara were incredible.,1
3424,"I made reservations to celebrate my aunts 45 birthday who just so happens to be from out of town on Wednesday May 23. Our reservation was for 5:30 and we got sat at about 5:50. Normally it wouldn’t be an issue, however we had a tickets for Hamilton at 7:30 so we cut it very close. I ordered eggplant Parmesan with is typically my favorite dish from RPM but, it was extremely salty. My aunt had the Maine lobster ravioli and while the filling was good, the ravioli themselves were terribly undercooked and hard to eat. My sister had one of the specials which was a stuffed pasta noodle fill with mushrooms and it had absolutely no flavor. Service was okay but definitely not great and the dishes that night were a miss which was very unfortunate since it was a special occasion.",0
3425,"Two years ago I spent an evening at RPM during a quick weekend shopping visit from Winnipeg Canada with a girlfriend and it was perfect.  Now two years later we are living on Vancouver Island, Canada and my husband's 60th was coming up and there was nowhere else I wanted to celebrate the occasion than  RPM.  I called a few months ahead and let them know we would be arriving in October and would they arrange for a special table for us.   Well to say ""they did not disappoint"" would be an understatement.   The table was great, our server Carol, acknowledge that this was special evening for us and paced the meal perfectly.  The food was fantastic, my husband and brother in law are Sicilian born and are pretty fussy when it comes to Italian food.   We loved everything, the recommended wine was a hit and the Bellini's, the best I have had anywhere. The ricotta cheese and bread was a particular treat, we had to order more for my brother in law, who ""never"" eats ricotta LOL.   Carol was wonderful!!!   We will be making the trip again for sure.
Thank you so much!!
Debra, Andrea, Carmelo and Connie Corsaro",1
3426,"Amazing food, amazing customer service, and just flawless execution!! As a Canadian tourist who is a huge fan of Giuliana and Bill...I went in with high expections and it was exceeded on every note, worth every dollar! Ricotta toast, chicken parmesan, Mama D pasta, and the rice pudding with cinnamon blew my mind! Will return soon and tell everyone I know :) Oh also as a non-drinker I loved the gingerbeer grapefruit mocktail! Came here alone and customers waiting to eat kept asking if i was done...the hosts and hostesses nipped them right in the bud and put a reserved sign on my table regardless of me being a walk in! haha loved it!",1
3427,Awesome service and the food was great.  First time there but it won't be the last.  The kids ate the Brussel salad and we are not big Brussel sprout eaters.  The mini pizza was gone in a couple seconds.  My kids are 13 & 9 but love this restaurant.  The only negative I would give was that the hostess was not very nice.  She looked at my family with what kind of people are you eyes. The other hostess said I am really sorry but dining is full but you are welcome to sit anywhere in the bar seating.  Corrected the situation and our uncomfortable feeling immediately. We were not dressed up because we went to the Shedd Aquarium.  The waiters that we had were amazing.  Explained everything and made sure we had enough portions.,1
3428,Very nice atmosphere but food was terrible.  Tried several plates not impressed with any. Examble...Spaghetti Carbonera was not prepared properly. There was no real panchetta flavor and the raw egg remained uncooked. It should be added immediately into the hot pasta to cook. Would never return when there is a whole city of good eating to choose from.,0
3429,"RPM Italian has a lot to offer, with appetizers, pastas, and main courses carefully selected and prepared well. The wine list is a your of Italy, with excellent affordable items that are not easily found in other similar restaurants. The service makes the experience reccomendable, and Travis is outstanding. It a place to visit repeatedly.",1

Wait staff is courteous but busy.
We didn’t have reservations and were able to grab a bar hightop table within 15 minutes of arrival. (Unusual)
With no reservation you have to lurk over people you think are finishing up which is uncomfortable for this ambiance.
Portions resemble appetizers in size. Pricy but tasty.
All in all a nice place to feel like your part of the inn crowd but plan on an alternative after dinner meal somewhere else. 😉",1
3431,We enjoyed a family style dinner with 18 coworkers. Dinner and wine was great. I recommend the Prawns!,1
3432,"The hostess at the front desk was downright RUDE and is in need for some DIVERSITY training.  She gave us a table for three at the back of the restaurant despite seating available at the front of the restaurant. Maybe because we were Asians with travel clothes on as opposed to some fancy clothing.  It was only after we demanded better seating that we were provided a better table.

And by the way the food was SUBSTANDARD. NEVER AGAIN",0
3433,Waiter was terrible kept disappearing! Ordered spicy crab came out looking like a side order. Meatballs and pasta both cold. Very disappointing,0
3434,"I was expecting so much more... the bloody Mary was super spicy. And I asked the bar tender if it was and she said it was not too spicy. We only had appetizers and my bruschetta was not the traditional one as expected, and only 3 little pieces. The fried calamari mix that
Has shrimp and broccolini was not that good. Batter was greasy and some of the shrimp tasted horrible almost spoiled, I dont see myself going back.",0
3435,"Busy place. Was able to find a seat in the bar area easily however (first come first serve). Service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. My only quibble would the portion sizes, smaller than I would call typical. Although I'm sure that there are many that would say that's not a bad thing.",1
3436,"Nice spot. Good layout. Service was very friendly and attentive but not over bearing. For appetizers, fried artichokes were good, burrata mozzarella was good but I've had better, and the prosciutto is very good. For the entree, we shared the porter house steak. It was cooked as we ordered and very good. Again, not the best ever ever but still very good. As for the sides, we had the broccoli, mushrooms and brussel sprouts. The mushrooms were awesome! For dessert, we had their cannolis, which were light and refreshing (odd description for cannolies but its true).

Overall, nice experience.",1
3437,"Any time I come to Chicago,  i make a reservation here. SO GOOD!!",1
3438,"After hearing so much about RPM, my daughters and their friends decided to take me there for dinner.
My daughter has dined there several times and raved about the food and their "" BRUSSEL SPROUT SALAD""
I must say after much hype about it,  I was very disappointed.
The dishes were very salty, and the seasoning of the evening seemed to be RED PEPPER, it was in most of our entree's that we ordered.
My daughter said they changed the dressing on the brussel sprout salad, the dressing, seemed to have anchovie oil in it, which was new to her.
It made the salad it very salty.
Because it was an invite, i did not want to say to much, make a fuss, or ""look a gift horse in the mouth"" so to speak.
The service I would give 5 stars ...but the food, a mere 3 stars.",1
3439,"My wife was begging to go here on our stay in Chicago, but the only booking we could get was 10pm, so it was a stretch to wait that long for dinner for me.

Luckily, I was not at all disappointed with the food or ambience. The food is AMAZING and well worth the time to go there (Book well in advance)

Food was well presented, nice serving sizes, and all came out super quickly even though it was super busy that night.

Will go again when I am in town.",1
3440,"I love being able to actually dine. There was no rush and had a beautiful, delicious meal. Broad menu, but not overwhelming. The environment was very nice, but has a relaxed feel.",1
3441,This is what all other restaurants should be judged by going forward. If I could give RPM a higher rating than 5 stars I would. From service to food this place is top notch. A lot of nice restaurants focus more on atmosphere instead of quality of product and food. This places masters both! This is a place that you can take your Italian grandmother to eat and know that she well walk away without complaining about about the food. Btw This is a million times better than any garbage Giada has created. Highly recommend!!!!!,1
3442,"Best service I have ever had at a restaurant. Food was delicious, dessert so good. My server was amazing he knew what would pair best with what I wanted to eat.",1
3443,"Great food, great vibes! Our server Frankie gave us the best service.",1
3444,"It was an exquisite experience. Our server, Glen (I believe), made excellent suggestions and pairings of wine for each course. The food was top notch, and overall a good vibe. It was a great date night choice, and we will definitely be visiting again.",1
3445,"Loved the food here. Truffle risotto was great, and there pasta is also excellent as you might expect from a quality Italian resturaunt. The service is also excellent. As you might expect, the resturaunt is pricey, but worth it if you have a hankering for Italian.",1
3446,"A constant in the Chicago river north italian food scene. Started with whipped lard on sourdough and moved to some pastas, all of which were fresh, distinct, and delicious in their own right. Portions are larger than you’d think and service is attentive despite the size and reputation of the restaurant.",1
3447,"Food was delicious although portions were a bit small for the price. Ordering sides and bread and a salad are almost a must if you don't want to go home hungry. In doing so, however you'll be paying lots more.",1
3448,"Amazing food! Service is extremely knowledgeable and the food is fantastic. Duck agnolotti was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had! Great cocktails, reasonably priced food, and top-notch service. Highly recommended.",1
3449,Came for my anniversary dinner...I was worried that after so many years the quality wouldn’t be the same but RPM didn’t disappoint. Plus what great service by giving us some complimentary drinks to celebrate.,1
3450,Been loving this place since it opened. I had an excellent experience yet again. The food is  so delicious. Great ambiance and just an overall cool vibe. I would highly suggest starting off with a bellini 🍸,1
3451,"Wine tasting dinner.   Little organization. Decent food but very small portions. Seemed like 1 bottle for a  8 people.  Loud 'private ' area not conducive to conversation.
Won't return to RPM Italy...",0
3452,"The food, ambiance, service, and general experience was outstanding at RPM Italian.  We ordered several appetizers and each plate had its own unique twist that was incredible.

The entrées were delicious and well-worth the value.  The sauces and reductions truly tied the dishes together, and every plate throughout our experience was delightful.

Our waitress was also extremely knowledgeable and explained how certain components of the dishes which were most remarkable were prepared.  This piqued my interest enough to look up recipes afterward; I will now be attempting to make homemade lardo: pork back fat cured for six months and used as a spread.  Theirs, which we spread on focaccia, was one of the highlights of the night.",1
3453,"Where to start?! The happy hour specials are INSANE - I opted for Sauvignon Blanc (x2!) and also the tuna (x2!). Coming from an Italian household and having lived in Boston’s North End the last 13 years you can say I approached this celebrity owned Italian restaurant with skepticism (despite LOVING G from E News!). The food blew me away and surpassed all expectations. Fresh, complex, intricate, incredible! I cannot wait to make this THE staple for my Chicago work trips. Kudos to my waiter Kevin who made the experience extra fabulous - he was polite, fun, knowledgeable, helpful and even reminded me that ‘happy hour specials’ were ending and to order up to save $$! What a treat to have such a wonderful and devoted waiter...RPM is so lucky to have him!!",1
3454,"OMG Did not expect to love this place.  The grilled octopus, times 4 and you are set.  Delicious.  Did a simple dinner of salad and that - and boy it hit the spot.  Have recommended this place to many!  Worth trying out more of the menu on subsequent dates but the octopus must be included in all.",1
3455,"Delicious but the portions are so small for what you pay. The food is amazing so it's well worth it, just be prepared to hit up Taco Bell later when your body craves more food.",1
3456,"My only complaint about RPM Italian is that if you're only a party of two, make sure you specify you do NOT want to be seated at the tiny table next to the sommelier station.  I had been there once before with a party of 4 total and had much better seating. This table was awful, and I had made reservations a month ago--we weren't walk-ins. We asked to be moved but the host said he could only let us sit at the bar or give up our table immediately and wait for another to open up. He said the Rancics were the next table coming in to sit across from us, so we were incentivized to stay put. We felt totally in the way of foot traffic since we moved my friend's seat over so she wouldn't face the sommelier station. The Rancics did not come in, and by this time I suggested to the host that he could comp something to help with the experience (seriously--a drink, a dessert, something small just to balance things out). He said he'd see what he could do, and by the end of the evening nothing was done.  I was so disappointed to not give my friend the whole amazing experience I had on my first visit. This table should not even exist for this price point.  Otherwise service, food, and drinks were fabulous as ever.  We had a female server who recommended the dessert and dessert drinks which were outstanding.  Would go back again as long as I get better seating.",1
3457,"Exceptional first time experience at RPM Italian...
We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with a dinner that was fantastic...!!!
Andre' was polished in his craft of attention to detail, charm and always a step ahead of acceptable service...Bravo...!!!",1
3458,"Fantastic cocktails, food, and service. Particularly the steak tartare, ricotta appetizer, and pork chop.",1
3459,"Very chic, sexy restaurant perfect for date night or after work drinks with your office crush. Enjoyed a round of well-made classic cocktails and Italian inspired appetizers. They also have an extensive wine list.",1
3460,"Food was beyond amazing! Wine was great. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Chelsea is an incredible server. Best meal in Chicago, one of the best meals I've ever had anywhere!",1
3461,"Wonderful place and a great atmosphere. Get a reservation! Don't be more than 15 min late! This place is pretty popular, so they have to be strict about that. There's valet parking - the night we were there it was $15 which is what garage parking in the area costs. The wait staff is friendly and the food is wonderful. Definitely check this pace out!",1
3462,"Finally - a 'fancy-pants' restaurant I can enjoy. I recently went to RPM Italian with two close friends for a weeknight dinner outing. Our reservations were at 8pm and they sat us at 8:05pm (most of the similar restaurants in town can take up to an hour after your reservation time). Our server was Amy and she was beyond incredible. She not only had great recommendations, but we all felt like we were walking out of there having made a new best friend. The ambiance was great: comfortable seating, nice lighting and music that gave a good vibe but wasn't so loud that you felt you had to scream. Bill Rancic was walking around greeting people from table to table and you can tell that every employee was genuinely happy to be working at a great place. I will definitely be back to RPM soon (assuming the reservation list isn't too far in advance).",1
3463,"Just visited over the weekend and had to check it out since it was the one of the most booked restaurants in chicago. All the dishes and wine list is legit with impeccable service. This place, unlike traditional restaurants, keeps the price low on each dish while also keeping the portions small so that you can try variety in stead of getting full with one dish. They ready the trend well with millenials and reviews are reflextive of that. Highly recommended to anyone.",1
3464,"This has been my third time coming here in 4 months so I knew there must be something special about it. But there isn't. It is like any 5 star Italian restaurant in Chicago, it's no alinea. The food is amazing, but the restaurant is not. The atmosphere is amazing but the restaurant still isn't amazing . The service is amazing but the restaurant isn't. What could make this restaurant amazing is if they can provide you with the same quality dishes as the current ones, but make it different then you can find at any other restaurant. And that is when michelin will come",1
3465,"The atmosphere at RPM is as great as the food is.  From the moment we walked in we knew this was going to be a wonderful experience.  The service was excellent and the booth we sat in was perfect for our small party.  Can't miss items: brussel sprout salad (my favorite of the LEYE restaurants) and Burrata for appetizers.  Our server made great recommendations on where to go from there and we loved every dish that came out, still thinking about those pastas.  Our plates were licked clean.  Italian food executed perfectly!",1
3466,"Had a great experience at RPM. The wait staff was top notch, always keeping our water filled and coming by with silverware by course. My friend and I went for lunch and had the Buratta appetizer and we each got our own homemade Braised Short Ribs Pappardelle. For dessert try the homemade doughnuts they were amazing!",1
3467,"Amazing, bar area Host was Top Notch, we got lucky & seated quickly!",1
3468,"If you don't read any reviews please just read this one. My fiancé made a reservation for a big party of 9 for today 3/17/1017. This morning we had an unfortunate family emergency and are currently are at the hospital as I am writing this review. We called RPM Italian and they took great care of us amongst all this chaos. I promise you, we will be back countless times. We appreciate everyone for understanding this situation and I would like to Thank anyone that helped us out today.",1
3469,"My friends and I had reservations for months. When we arrived for our 5pm reservation on a Friday night, the restaurant was not yet busy. I admit we were a few minutes late because of traffic, however we notified the restaurant and were told it was not a problem. We were walked past empty table after empty table and seated in a booth in the back corner of the restaurant by the kitchen door. When we asked to be moved, we were moved up about two tables. The gal who was going to be our server apologized and told us our new server would be out shortly. Ok, I understand section assignments. However, much to my dismay, when the young gentleman server arrived at our table (I cannot tell you his name because I cannot recall him giving it to us, though I may not have heard him) he immediately started telling us, unprompted, about items on the menu (great) while simultaneously informing my friend and I about the comparable portion sizes (not so great).

My friend and I are overweight. I can't speak for her in this instance, but I'm not particularly sensitive about it. I only mention it here so that it provides some context to the above mention of portion sizes and the way he mentioned them. I wish there was a way to describe his intonation, emphasis on certain syllables and words, and non-verbal communications. In this situation, given the fact that he only referred to my friend and I, and not her size 5 daughter, all three of us felt condescended.

We are educated women. We work in Guest Relations and Hospitality, having experience working with Universal and Disney properties, and also Four Diamond Gaming and Resorts. We appreciate fine service when we receive it and reward it accordingly.

I eagerly anticipated our visit to RPM Italian. I'm saddened that, due to our experience, we left the restaurant before tasting anything. I'm saddened even more so that this was the single blight on what was an absolutely fabulous weekend.",0
3470,"Outstanding  food and service.   Make reservations,  or take a chance with the few bar tables and chairs.  Our waitress was on top of everything. The rest of the staff just flowed around taking care to insure everything stayed just right.",1
3471,"Outstanding food, every dish!  We sampled the brussel sprouts salad, truffle garlic bread, eggplant parmesan, lobster ravioli, sea bass, giant shrimp, and more...all excellent!  Equally outstanding service, friendly and informative.",1
3472,"Cocktails we're very good, food was excellent and service was great! Probably need a reservation for this place as it seemed to be packed. My friend and I were lucky to come upon bar seats as we walked in.",1
3473,"RPM Italian delivered a memorable experience through swanky decor, white-glove service, and delicious food. The Brussels sprouts side was extra crispy and possibly the best we've had (would recommend as an appetizer). Best pasta dish we ordered was the squid ink pasta with king crab and Fresno chilis. You shouldn't walk out the door without ordering the Italian brioche donuts!",1
3474,"Rpm stands for Really Pricey Meal.  There is no emphasis on speed or honestly with the staff here.  They seem friendly enough, but they lied to my face including the manager multiple times.  ""Yeah we're just finishing it"" they would say. Sounds like a blowoff line because it is.  I checked with the manager four times over the course of my hour and a half wait before she finally admitted they lost the order and we're putting it in.  There was no apology or offer for gift card, meal compensation, nothing.  I don't like to give bad reviews, but rpm earned it.",0
3475,"Best rissotto ever! Travis was our waiter and he was amazing. Thanks Travis and thanks RPM Italian, you have a great place here in Chicago. This is a must if you visit the Windy City.",1
3476,"Well, what else can be said that hasn't already been?  Lively spot for some of the best Italian food in the country.  Was pleasantly surprised at how awesome the home-made pasta noodles tasted.  Can't wait to go back and try other items.",1
3477,"The decor at RPM is very sleek and trendy.  However, the food was just okay.  My favorite dish was the brussel sprout salad, but the pasta dishes didn't wow us.  For Italian food in the city, I'd go somewhere else, but RPM is a great place to grab a couple drinks and appetizers.",1
3478,"Since moving out to the suburbs, my husband and I have had to defend our choice to our urbanite friends. Here are our reasons:

1. We have eight times more space.
2. Both working from home, we would prefer to not actually be on each other's work calls.
3. Our dogs have their own personal dog park in our yard.
4. The silence (comparatively).

And when we still get asked questions like ""but where do you EAT?"", we respond with a wink: ""we drive into the city"". There are many, many good places to eat in the suburbs, but once a month anyway,  we make the big, bad drive in to the city (because it is usually late on the Saturday this takes us an easy thirty minutes). Some restaurants are not even worth that much time in the car, but RPM Italian is worth the drive.

I made reservations two and a half months out for 7:30pm on a Saturday. This was our first night out as a married couple and the first Saturday after my husband's birthday, so this was going to be a pretty ceremonial dinner. The waitress brought us a prosecco toast for both celebrations and a homemade ricotta (with pomodoro) that was amazing. The bread served with it looked like it would be a hard french loaf, but was soft. The ricotta was served with a little olive oil, which made it taste even better than any ricotta I have ever had.

The service was warm, but unobtrusive. We had a lot of information about the menu before we ordered and I think we ordered well.

What we ordered (with comments):
The special squash blossom appetizer, which was like the best mozzarella stick you've ever eaten. Mama DePandi's Bucatini Pomodoro with the gluten-free pasta, which you would never be able to tell was gluten-free by taste, and one meatball (because apparently you can order just one meatball on the side-- nice option). The Bone-in Ribeye, which came without a lot of garnishments and sauces; it was just a really nicely cooked steak, well-seasoned. Grilled Giant Prawns, which were very herb-y and needed the lemon that came with it sprayed all over it. Sautéed Broccolini, which was a nice complement.

For dessert, we had this gelato-filled mocha crunch ball... so, so good.

The thing about this meal is that I was full, but not stuffed. They were nice portions and, if you share the pasta, you get a nice sampling of a lot of flavors. The price of the meal is what completely surprised me. Our total bill was $163 with four cocktails added. Such nice pricing, nice service, nice food, nice environment. Well worth the drive in from the suburbs.",1
3479,Make a reservation . I recommend Mama Depandi's pasta. Busy hopping place.,1
3480,"Initially, rather than being called RPM Italian, this place could have been called Barnum and Bailey's Italian.  We had reservations for 10, and despite rushing to get there on time, they were running behind.  The bar was so completely packed that we decided to go somewhere else for a couple of drinks while we waited for our table.  The bar inside definitely has a bit of a clubby vibe to it, so it was a good move for us to go in search of an alternate venue for drinks.  Especially since you get a convenient text message when your table is ready.

So why would I give a place five stars despite starting off the review like this?  Quite frankly the food and the rest of the service was phenomenal.  After waiting a while We were pretty decided on what we wanted to eat until we were told about the special.  I usually don't go for specials at all, but when you say say squash blossoms stuffed with burratta and lightly fried you are speaking my language these little cheesy morsels were the best things I've had to eat in quite some time.

We also had the truffled Garlic bread, which was pretty good.  Seven dollars good is kind of questionable, it is a rather large serving of bread, but then again it is a rather large serving of bread.

Despite the fact that we did have a bottle  of wine involved, that small plates method of dining usually creates a big sticker shock, but for the experience it felt very cheap in the end.  Granted they did end up comping two of the plates due to their lateness but that aside, for that experience, with a bottle of wine to share and enough food to satisfy two hungry people, I expected a price tag much higher than $140 (inclusive of tip) for this caliber of restaurant.  A definite must try in Chicago.",1
3481,"OMG - our waiter Bobby must be recognized for his exceptionally professional, polite, accommodating, well versed & personable service. The food & drinks were amazing but we can’t stop raving about the service. Thanks Bobby & team for a great experience! Xo",1
3482,"Terrible experience. Will not spend my money with them every again. Greeters at the front desk were very unprofessional. Do not let the decor and ambiance fool you. Good food, but left a bad impression. Plenty of other great Italian restaurants in Chicago that will provide a good experience in all areas.",0
3483,"Fun place for groups - food is small plates; everything is solid. 4 stars only because they play house music and it's LOUD inside, but hey that's the scene. Beautiful people everywhere - bring the wallet!",1
3484,"I dined at RPM Italian this past weekend.  Food tasted extraordinarily fresh, seemed simply prepared and seasoned, and extremely flavorful.  No salt, pepper, or parmesan cheese was provided on the table like at other Italian restaurants and it was clear why--the food simply did not need it.  Ordered glasses of Pinot Grigio, Carbonara w/ yolk, prawns, mushrooms (amazing!), tuscan kale salad, lobster caprese, and pistachio gelato for dessert.  Service was A1, ambiance was romantic, and the food came out quickly.  If an improvement must be noted, the portion of pasta was quite small and I am a relatively small person. Also, the prawns were served inside the shell--I prefer my shrimp/prawns  served sans the shell.  That is more of a personal preference though I suppose--aside from the shell, the prawns were very delicious.",1
3485,"The food was soooo good. The lobster caprese and prosciutto were divine! Their cocktails were very good as well. Getting a reservation isn't easy though, call far in advance, it is worth the wait.",1
3486,"The ambiance was perfect. Great for a romantic dinner, but did see a couple of families. We ordered the filet mignion, mama DiPandi’s bucatini, mushrooms and the swordfish. It was all amazing! Can’t wait to go back someday.",1
3487,"Such an awesome dining experience!!  From start to finish it was incredible!  The ambiance is part of the experience.  My server Jaclyn was suberb!  Ask for her by name...""Jaclyn"".  I can't wait to return.",1
3488,"RPM is one of the hottest restaurants in Chicago right now...but does it live up to the hype? Well...

The decor is just fabulous. It is the epitome of urban chic. You could take this restaurant and drop it into New York or LA and not know the difference. The lighting was very well done, and they have these long, luxurious curtains that I just loved.  Gorgeous. The look is versatile enough that it is a great place for a girls night out, a business dinner, a rehearsal dinner, a happy hour or a fun date. At 6pm, the place was packed. All of the beautiful people were out and it is definitely a scene. A place to see and be seen. If you have some cute new shoes and you want to show them off, this is the place to go.

The food however, was good solid food with quality ingredients, but I wasn't 100% completely blown away. The food is small-plates Italian food, and it's good, but not off-the-charts excellent. My dining partners agreed. We ordered several items, including the 600-day Prosciutto (tasty), the homemade Ricotta with Semolina toast (eh...), the shredded brussels sprouts salad (tasted way too healthy for my liking) the roasted mushrooms (could have made them better at home), the Bucatini Pomodoro (ok), and the the Duck Agnoletti (just ok). The best dessert was the hazelnut Tartufo, which was literally like a frozen Ferrero Rocher candy - hazelnut gelato covered with a dark chocolate shell, sprinkled with hazelnuts. You need a knife to cut it. If you are a hazelnut fan, you would love this dessert.  That was my favorite item of the evening.

I would go back, but mainly for the ambiance.  The prices were actually pretty fair, especially for the prime location. It's worth a visit for the decor alone - it's a cool place to hang out.",1
3489,"Hands down, this is one of the best restaurants I've ever ate at.  Top five best restaurants in the world, in my opinion.  Prices are very reasonable for this quality of food.  Highly recommend!",1
3490,"Somewhat high end in terms of price, but has a commemorating quality level. Pastas are generally freshly made and are portioned for appetizer sharing purposes. Not quite a steakhouse, but they manage to make a pretty decent flat iron.",1
3491,"Great atmosphere, food, and service. One of those places you bring your parents when they come to visit, bonus if they also pick up the tab",1
3492,Great food and atmosphere.  The menu is very diverse for an Italian restaurant and appeals to all appetites.  If not for the ridiculous amount of reservations they have I would want to eat here every week.,1
3493,Our server was impeccable. The food is always delicious and spot on. Love this place cause you never know if a famous celebrity will pop in. Thanks again RPM Italian!,1
3494,"First class dining experience. Apart from the grilled octopus appetizer which was ridiculously over-salted, all our dishes were well-prepared and delicious.  If you're really lucky, you'll be there on a day when they're offering the veal Osso Buco. It's the best you'll ever have.
On our last visit we had the aforementioned salty octopus and the 600 day prosciutto.  They serve the prosciutto with grilled bread so good it's worth ordering by itself.
For entrees we had the short ribs served with a side of gnocchi in cheese sauce. One order of scallops, and some pappardelle with pork ragu. The meat dish was the clear winner. The scallops were fine- fresh, nothing fancy. Oddly, (for a restaurant that bills itself as Italian) the pappardelle were a bit tough for a fresh pasta. I like my dry pasta ""al dente"", but fresh pasta, not so much.

Great wine list and drink program, too.

So despite the minor food disappointments, this was still a 4.5 dinner.",1
3495,"Food was good.  Seated us nearly an hour late -- but, very apologetic and great service.  While we will probably not go back, you should give them a chance and decide for yourself.",1
3496,"The ambiance, the staff and the service was fantastic and the food was outstanding! I would recommend the lobster tortellini and the fire roasted octopus. Portions were perfect and really every dish was superb.",1
3497,"We were there for our Anniversay, Food was fine by me but my wife didnt care for it. It was a bit pricey, but while the server did terrific presentation and discription of the food when asked if we wanted desert or anything else and we answered no, the sarcastic ""lovely"" we could have done without. I over tipped by my standards for the sarcasm, I should have left a dollar but left 20%. My wife said maybe we should go to the RPM Steak next time. I said no. I am not dropping that kind cash to be treated like that. I will never go to any RPM again.",0
3498,Food and service was amazing. Thank you for a great dining experience.,1
3499,"Amazing atmosphere, fantastic staff, and the food didn't disappoint! Our server Zoey was kind and informative and had the right amount of friendliness! Highly suggest the gnocchi with the truffles and Mama DePandi's Bucatini!",1
3500,Well presented and flavourful Italian cuisine on top of impeccable FOH service accentuated by the luxurious decor kept up the prestige of an amazing restaurant. Well worth the dinning experience. 5 star.,1
3501,"If there are more than 5 stars, I would give it all too RPM. Very thoughtful staff, they remember your name and recognize you. This is our go to and we have recommended it to many of our friends. My bf even brought his company staffs to have a dinner meeting there. That’s how much we love about it.",1
3502,"Shoutout to Amanda, our amazing server. She went above an beyond to welcome me and my 3 friends to RPM. It was our first dine in experience. Us being from Crown Point, Indiana, we rarely go out to fancy restaurants. After our meal, we will be back again. Amanda assisted very well, making sure we understoood the menu and make us feel right at home. The atmosphere and menu was overwhelming, as we are used to typical olive garden type resturants. We became comfortable after Amanda suggested items on the menu, overall she was extremely kind and professional. We really hope Amanda will be our waitress next time we go!",1
3503,The definition of overpriced and mediocre italian food. I fully do not understand the hype. This is the least I have enjoyed italian food in years. Go down to nico osteria instead. It's 5 minutes away and 99x better.,0
3504,Very excited to finally go to RPM but walked out disappointed with the service. The food was delish but I prefer friendly servers. I thought a family restraunt would be more welcoming. The only time our server smiled was when she handed us the check to pay (tip time).,1
3505,"The food was good but in no way do I believe it was worth the extremely high prices. If you want good Italian food that is priced about 300% too much, just to eat in this neighborhood, then this is your place.",1
3506,Best meal I’ve had in a long time. Excellent service start to finish. Can’t wait to go back!,1
3507,Everything was very good... especially the cheesecake! It was flavorful and creamy. The filet was perfectly cooked and seasoned...and the customer service was top notch. Oh...and their old fashion was outstanding.,1
3508,"Glorious!

Really original Italian cuisine, everything is homemade and tastes like in Italy. The decoration is also original Italian.

Great service, completely satisfied you feel like in Italy. A visit is definitely worthwhile.",1
3509,"Good Italian restaurant. Nice atmosphere. Not loud but plenty of energy. Smoked octopus was delicious. Homemade pasta, interesting combinations. Smart drink menu.",1
3510,Loved everything starting with appetizers to dessert.   Our server (Nina) was excellent and so informative about the menu.   Will definitely return when I'm back in town.,1
3511,"I'm relatively picky when it comes to Italian food, but everything we had to eat here was absolutely delicious and came out super fast, even with a crowded Valentines Day crowd. Started with the truffle garlic bread and shredded brussel sprouts salad, highly recommend both. Then my wife and I shared 2 plates - the special truffle gnocchi and the cavatelli. My wife had a hard time sharing the gnocchi - it was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic. The pasta was great too with the classic red sauce and shredded pork/beef. We finished with the dessert special - some mini fried donut thingies with marscapone and Nutella. Sweet treat to end the meal. All around amazing experience and will definitely be coming back with a group to try more!",1
3512,"First the reservation was late, but that's not a deal breaker. The service was very good. However, they don't even give you bread, you have to pay for it. The lobster caprese was flat. The fried arancini was bland and missing the prosciutto. The lone highlight was the fried burrata, but it was tiny. We also had the carbonara, which was good, but too heavy with the pepper. Overall it felt pretentious and glamorous but the food couldn't stand up to it.",0
3513,"Plates are small, music too loud, meatballs spaghetti was ok but nothing spectacular. Very nice waiters in white uniforms. Overall nit bad however nothing too exciting.",1
3514,"If there are more than 5 stars, I would give it all too RPM. Very thoughtful staff, they remember your name and recognize you. This is our go to and we have recommended it to many of our friends. My bf even brought his company staffs to have a dinner meeting there. That’s how much we love about it.",1
3515,"Came here with 3 people without a reservation and we were able to find 3 consecutive seats at the bar. You will need a reservation if you want to eat at the dining area. This place gets very busy quick.

We ordered the Spicy King Crab pasta, Atlantic Swordfish, and Eggplant Parmesan wood-oven baked. I only got a chance to try the Spicy King Crab pasta and Atlantic Swordfish.

Both were excellent dishes. In general, I would say the portions for this type of restaurant is on the smaller side. That's just unfortunate. The amount of king crab was proportionate to the amount of squid ink spaghetti you got. The crab meat was fresh and there was no water left at the bottom of the plate after consuming the spaghetti. There was enough spice/kick to the dish. It may be a little strong for some people so beware. The pasta itself was delicious. It was cooked perfectly and didn't taste any flour. The amount of squid ink used was just right. Sometimes some places overdo it with the ink and it leaves a weird aftertaste in your mouth.

The Atlantic Swordfish was surprisingly moist and flaked off nicely. I thought it would have been a meatier fish and assumed the dish would be on the drier side but they cooked the fish quite nicely. Only issue was that it was over seasoned. Other than that, the fish was cooked perfectly and even got grill marks on it.

The service at the bar was great. The bartender was very nice and got our drinks and food in a timely fashion. It was very busy that night so we didn't get a chance to chat with him.

I would recommend this restaurant and would definitely come here again. Both aforementioned dishes were excellent and would recommend them.",1
3516,"Food was delicious but there was quite a wait for our server to come to us. I ended up having to flag her down because we were sitting for over half an hour without anyone coming to take our order. After we ordered, the food came very quickly.",1
3517,"RPM Italian is one of those places that people are always talking about, and you have to make your reservations at least a month in advance if you want to be able to dine at a reasonable time--- so naturally, this place was on my list of restaurants to try. I’m not sure if the fact that the restaurant is backed by Bill and Giuliana Rancic helps it or helps it—I’m leaning towards the hurts it for me because I think Giuliana is overrated. But I still wanted to try the place to see for myself.

The seating in the restaurant is a bit tight, especially at the2 tops. The service here is more of a 5 star place, but the mediocre food makes RPM a 3 star for me.  The server was courteous and patient. When he found out that I didn’t care for the provolone stuffed peppers, he took care of it—I was expecting the provolone to be soft, and definitely wasn’t expecting the spicy kick to the peppers—I suppose it’s because the stuffed peppers I get usually are grilled so they’re sweeter. The truffled garlic bread was good. I really enjoyed my spicy king crab--- a perfect combo of sauce and seafood with the squid ink pasta. The bucatini really is just mediocre pasta with tomato sauce on top--- I don’t get why everybody else raves about it. Paired it with the prime beef meatballs, which were just average as well. We really did enjoy the tartufo for dessert- ice cream with a hazelnut chocolate shell. I wanted to try the cannoli and chocolate budino, but that might have to wait for another night.",1
3518,"Great service, great food. I live down the street from here and would come way more often if I didn't have to always make a reservation a month out. Best chicken parm I have ever had also!",1
3519,Great bar area and high energy room. Thought the menu was great for groups and a wide range of tastes. Surprised that there are so many inexpensive choices on both the food and wine menus.,1
3520,"A lot of hype because it is a celebrity restaurant but it does have one of my favorite desserts. I'm not sure if it's a place to be seen anymore but it is very popular for girl's night outs I've heard. One night I was here I saw Blackhawks players Marian Hossa, Johnny Oduya and Niklas Hjalmarsson but be classy if you see anyone because they don't want/need to be bothered.

It was very standard Italian restaurant food that was pretty inconsistent. Some dishes were very good while others were kind of bad. Mama Depandi's dish was on the low end and honestly tasted like jarred tomato sauce. It was not something I would be proud to have my name on. The appetizers are very standard and very average, especially the meatballs. My favorite dishes were the Wood-Roasted Octopus, Cavatelli and the best was the Potato Gnocchi with the wild boar sausage, so much flavor.

Don't mess around with anything for dessert except the Tartufo. It is crunchy, creamy, sweet and savory all together. It is in my opinion, the best dessert in Chicago.",1
3521,The service was amazing! A bottle of water accidentally broke on us and the server and manager were so attentive and made sure everyone was alright. They went out of their way to make sure we had an awesome night.,1
3522,"Came here with some co-workers for an early dinner on a Thursday. It was busy but we were seated pretty quickly. Service was attentive and quick to make menu recommendations. This is not your classical Italian restaurant, very modern decor that fits the vibe. Also had to note, the hostesses looked like models, so guys play it cool when you go there and don't let your draw drop in front of your date. Here is a summary of what we had:

Truffled Garlic Bread - Garlic bread is generally a must get item, this iteration which is infused with truffle flavor makes it more so. Start your meal with this.

Imported Burrata - I am a huge burrata fan and this was up to my standards

Watermelon & Tomato - I liked it but I am not too sure I would rush to order it again. It was good, light, and refreshing

Mama Depandi's Bucatini Pomodoro - The bucatini is apparently a highlight of this restaurant. Once I had it I had to agree, get this!

Sweet Pea Risotto - Generally I love risotto, this one... eh, not so much. It wasn't bad it just wasn't all that flavorful.

Carbonara - Another highlight for me, not too far off the reservation as far as Carbonara goes. The presentation on the plate was excellent

Potato Gnocchi - Like the risotto, I am usually a big gnocchi fan. This was good, just not up to the quality of the bucatini or the carbonara.",1
3523,"RPM is delicious.  There is no denying that.  They make great food, and typically have strong service.  It definietly has a modern trendy vibe, and the bar is always packed.  If you like mushrooms definitely get the Cremini Mushroom pizza, you won't regret it",1
3524,"I ordered their $17 Butternut Squash Agnolotti on Postmates. I was BEYOND disappointed. It took forever to prepare, it arrived at my apartment half cold (not the fault of the delivery person, who was on the road for maybe 5-7 minutes). The portions are TINY (there were maybe 8 agnolotti, each smaller than my thumb). It wasn’t even flavorful, I found it to be safe and boring. I could have purchased a frozen dinner and I wouldn’t have known the difference. I’m a college student, ordering takeout is a real treat because I usually can’t afford it. I feel robbed, what a waste of my money and time.",0
3525,Met every expectaion it was great to finally eat at rpm Italian for myself i will definitely recommend anyone looking for a great meal,1
3526,Excellent service. They definitely give you large proportions of food. The atmosphere is romantic but can also go for a business dinner.,1
3527,Great food. The service was amazing. We got some complementary sorbets which were the best flavors I had tasted. Great going RPM.,1
3528,"No one is perfect but Andre, our server, is pretty dam close. Forget that the food here will knock your socks off, (shout out to the Ricotta Gnocchi & Maine Lobster Ravioli), Andre has great energy & makes dining here one hell of an experience!!",1
3529,"Had a fantastic meal back by great service at this hip restaurant in Chicago. We sat at the bar, enjoyed the conversation and the cocktails before enjoying everything we ate. A sure thing, highly recommended.",1
3530,"I came here for my birthday. I've always heard good things and I have to agree, RPM is an excellent place for special occasions.

We ordered the meatballs (good starter, huge balls), wood grilled octopus (absolutely delicious), spicy crab pasta (great dish, good ratio of noodle and crab, I think the squid ink pasta at Piccolo Sogno Due is better though), homemade cavatelli (not as great as the spicy crab pasta, sauce was nice), bone-in ribeye (he thought it was a bit salty, but I didn't think so) and a side of cauliflower (did not like the dish at all. I wish we knew it came with raisins), limoncello sorbet (wish it was just lemon/lime sorbet instead), raspberry sorbet (good) and pistachio gelato (best flavor of the three) and a birthday dessert comprised of mini cones with gelato (best flavor was coconut and vanilla).

All in all, the food was great except for a few minor issues. Service was very good. Total was $160ish including two drinks. I would highly recommend RPM if you're looking for someplace to celebrate.",1
3531,Thank you for amazing service and yummy pasta and the cute dessert.,1
3532,"The food here is good, not amazing. The waitress did spill half a drink on a member of our party and she didn't do anything for us. Classless.",1
3533,"We love this place!  Food is outstanding,  service is impeccable. The Mama Dipandi pasta is a big hit.  Most plates are small,  so you can try numerous dishes.",1
3534,"Delicious delicious 😋 food ❤️
Amazing place.",1
3535,"I had the best pasta I've ever tasted in my life at this place. Portion is small and price is steep. However, RPM offers nice ambience and great service.",1
3536,"The food was absolutely perfect. Prices were high, but not crazy. My biggest qualm with the place was the wait. We had dinner reservations that we actually ended up showing up 30-40 mins early for and knew we would need to wait. We went across the street for drinks and returned at our scheduled time. We then waited another 45 mins to be seated.",1
3537,"I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. The service is amazing, the food is delicious, and the ambience is super nice. Make room for the bomboloni for dessert, it is to die for!!",1
3538,"I can say its the best octopus I've had before. The reason for the 3 stars is a couple of reasons. 1 is they were 20 minutes late when we had a reservation.  Second is the exhausting wait for our courses and the variety of people they allow in here. When you are trying to celebrate an anniversary with your wife and have a romantic evening at a fine dining establishment, the last thing you want to see is somebody in a Chicago Cubs Jersey with a hat. We paid 160 total and while it was good, I wouldnt return as you could get way more for your money at a place like Il Porcellino.",1
3539,Had a great Valentine's Day experience at RPM Italian! Get the short rib pasta! Get the chicken parm! Most importantly get the garlic bread!,1
3540,"Always one of my favorite date night spots. Come for the lobster caprese, stay for the amazing desserts that go well beyond the traditional cannoli. I recently had the grilled prawns and filet mignon which were great. The short rib pappardelle is one of my favorites on the menu! If you're looking for a modern take on Italian cuisine, RPM Italian does not disappoint. If you're looking for more traditional, comforting Italian, I recommend Il Porcellino that's around the block.",1
3541,"I thought the portions were a little small, but the food tasted great. They wait staff is also really friendly and helpful. We felt a little under-dressed in tshirts and jeans.",1
3542,"This chic all-white restaurant is wonderful and has a great modern spin on classic Italian food. I've been here on several occasions and enjoyed my experience each time. The staff is impeccable and the food is divine.

Some of favorite dishes include: Lobster caprese (literally this is a MUST get here), fresh homemade ricotta, truffled garlic bread, Mama DePandi's bucatini, papperdelle bolognese, and the handmade cavatelli.

If you're interested in having a romantic date night or celebrating a special occasion this is a perfect spot!",1
3543,"Snotty hostesses aside, this is a fantastic place. The food is fresh and delicious, the service is superb and the wine list is extensive. Thus place is always crowded so make a reservation at least a week before.",1
3544,"Amazing food! Worth the price!

Had the truffle gnocchi, absolutely to die for. Highly recommend the Hazelnut Tartufo dessert.",1
3545,"Always amazing food and service. Definitely make a reservation as they are always busy.

Save room for dessert!",1
3546,"Classic Italian with a modern twist! Everything was absolutely fantastic and they do have significantly smaller portions than your typical Italian fare . It's great to come and split a couple of apps, anti pasta, salads, pastas or entrees. The pasta was a little to al dente for my preference but overall I'd be back.",1
3547,Amazing..... always.    Mouth is watering thinking of the mushroom risotto,1
3548,"I love RPM!  Been here many times and I absolutely love the trendy, chic vibe of the black and white interior.  Drinks are delicious and food is amazing.

For drinks, I've really enjoyed the Classic Bellini and the plethora of wines on the list.

Some of my favorites include:  Truffle Garlic Bread, both of the pizzettes, Shredded Brussels Sprouts salad, Meatballs, Mama DePandi's Bucatini, and Lobster Ravioli.  The Tartufo for dessert is amazeballs!  I could eat the entire thing myself, probably resulting in stomach pains.  But it'd be well worth it!

The Spicy King Crab Squid Ink Spaghetti has been the only disappointing dish, thus far.

I have yet to try so many of the other dishes, so I'll keep coming back, especially in hopes of meeting Guiliana and Bill!",1
3549,"From the octopus appetizer to the donuts for dessert, this was a top-notch meal. You literally cannot go wrong. Great atmosphere and high quality food.",1
3550,The Best! I know the RPM Italian for years. They really know how to make you feel great when you walk in. It has such an authentic New York atmosphere and the food is always fantastic! Best Tiramisu I have ever had.,1
3551,We sat at the bar and had their oat milk cappuccino. It was a really fun vibe and the coffee was so creamy and delicious.,1
3552,Always consistent food and good service.,1
3553,"RPM is a trendy Italian establishment in River North. The atmosphere and ambience are very well thought out. I went with a group of four and ordered several of the appetizers and pasta dishes and eat them family style. I thought the food was very tasty but overpriced. You are definitely paying to visit Giuliana and Bill Rancic's place. We had the following in order of my favorites.

Appetizers: Wood-Roasted Octopus (almost tasted like pork - so good), Roman-Style Artichokes, Prime Beef Meatballs, Lobster Caprese, Shredded Brussels Sprouts (just eh)

Pasta: Spicy King Crab (my favorite), Maine Lobster Ravioli, Pumpkin Gnocchi, Potato Gnocchi, Mama Depandi's Bucatini (Add a meatball or two)",1
3554,RPM never go wrong always have great food great service and they definition take care Health regulation due to the covid-19,1
3555,"Excellent restaurant with professional employees and a great vibe. For dessert, the RPM cheesecake is a must! Large enough for two people, and by far the best cheesecake you will have in the US.",1
3556,Delicious food at reasonable prices. We really enjoyed everything we ordered. All the pasta was homemade and fresh.,1
3557,"I am a big fan of Bill and Giuliana and watched their show when they were first opening this restaurant and I have been dying to go check it out.  I will finally be in the Chicago area and the first thing I wanted to do was go to dinner at RPM'S but after reading these reviews I'm afraid to go try it out.   According to the reviews it's small portions and over priced.
Sad to hear and no longer looking forward to it.  I guess will dine elsewhere.",0
3558,We skipped the RPM hype and opted to go on a Monday where we had no problem getting a table.  Good thing I didn't wait months to get in - as the food was a bit lackluster and the small plate Italian concept wasn't quite enough to share.,1
3559,Dre was awesome.  Such detail to the food and cleanliness.  New plate and silverware for each portion of our meal.  Free glass of champagne and dessert for our anniversary.,1
3560,"Amazing italian dishes. Definitely a place to get a couple dishes and share with your table. Brussel sprouts are made in who knows what, but I want to eat them every single day. Dont skip on the ricotta and bread app either.",1
3561,"Good atmosphere , good food, great service but they didnt cook my friends salmon he sent it back once got it again and still undercooked. The manager took it off the bill. I will come back to give another chance.",0
3562,7 stars! The octopus and spicy crab squid ink pasta are unbelievably good. Might be the best restaurant we have ever been to. Fyi it's a little dressy.,1
3563,Great atmosphere. Top notch customer service. Smaller portion sized meals but delicious. Stuffed olives were delicious!,1
3564,This place is great! The food and service were amazing! Definitely come here! You'll need to get a reservation far in advance to get a good time.,1
3565,I was walking in to meet a friend and was immediately turned away at the door because I had shorts and flip flops on. Had I known about the dress code I would've dressed appropriately. There is a much more tactful way to send someone away.  That first impression just ruined any chance of returning.,0
3566,"Was amazed by the wine menu, easily one of the biggest. The food was amazing, a rather big price on it for simple items, however everything tasted amazing and the atmosphere was lovely. A tad loud though.",1
3567,A good experience with good service. Portions are small but it is an upscale place so it is expected. Took a star off since everything felt a bit too salty and I love salt! So that was a surprise.,1
3568,"King crab pasta, meatballs, prawns--A+

M aperol spritz was incredible

Love it and would revisit in a heartbeat",1
3569,"The truffle risotto, which is off menu, is exquisite. The service is even better.",1

3574,"Delicious food, and awesome service, and cool, chic vibe. The only thing is the pasta portions are a little small so make sure you order a salad for or have dessert if you want the pasta!",1
3575,"One of our favorite restaurants in Chicago. Chic, yet unpretentious, the service is always friendly and accommodating. And the food... I've never eaten anything here that wasn't absolutely delicious!",1

3577,Absolutely fantastic experience!  I was visiting from Philadelphia and they were so accommodating with getting me a table.    The best meatballs ever. Thank you for a great experience!,1
3578,"$44 for 6 tortellini noodles, what amounted to about a cup and a half of carbonara, and garlic bread.

Comparable quality Italian just about anywhere else in the city for portions that won’t make you roll your eyes.",0
3579,Very average. Not bad sevice. But not good. Food is very uninspired.  Has flavor but the flavor makes no sense at all. If your in chicago dont waste your time. Gibsons is better. This place is not special at all.,0
3580,"You'd think a place that claims to be this fancy and has the prices to go with it, could hire delivery drivers who understand how to communicate with customers about location. Horrible experience, my first night in Chicago, driver called me several times about my location and yet my delivery never showed up. Then it actually got marked as having been delivered on Grubhub. As a courtesy, I called the restaurant first just to see if there had been a mix-up and was rudely put on hold with no explanation. My next call of course was to Grubhub, I expect a full refund.",0

Wine selection is good as well.

3588,"If I'm being honest, I was first attracted to RPM Italian after I found out it was a celebrity hot spot of Chicago. I was also bedazzled by the online menu and interior pictures. Upon dining, no celebrities were encountered, however, the food, the environment, and the service exceeded my expectations (which were already high!). They even brought out a birthday surprise! Need I say more? I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area. Dear Philadelphia, please open a RPM location. Your brotherly loving citizens would be oh so happy.",1

3628,"Sleek, modern Italian resto serving drool-worthy pastas and seafood in portions you wish were a tiny bit bigger. The ravioli a la RPM was a single, large ravioli. A dish that looked like a single, massive, unaccompanied meatball was actually a gigantor chocolate ice cream ball encased in a shell of chocolate and hazelnut. Brilliant. Octopus: also brilliant.",1

3652,Wonderful place for our anniversary. They were so nice to us. Champagne and free desert. Treated us like royalty.,1
3653,"RPM Italian certainly lives up to its hype. While it appears they copied STK's interior design, the food couldn't be more different. If you're dining with a group, I suggest ordering lots of plates and sharing. Try to save room for the beignet doughnuts at the end!",1

3692,Ira is a licensed chauffeur. I take a lot of my clients to RPM restaurant. They also have me to return and pick them up,1
3693,Great options on the menu. The amount is fair for one person. I got a pretty good pasta. A little pricy. Polite and attencious staff.,1
3694,If you never had hand made pasta from here. you haven't lived yet. Had gluten free pasta option for the spicy king crab and it was the best pasta that I ever had.,1
3695,"Located in Chicago’s River North neighborhood, RPM Italian is modern in approach and Italian in spirit and features a contemporary, chef-driven menu with dishes meant to be shared.

4380,"Amazing dishes for really reasonable prices. I had the BEST sandwich in my life - the Spicy Chicken Churro Sandwich. It’s the perfect balance of salty and sweet and I would do anything to be able to taste the sandwich for the first time again.

Everything else including the guacamole, tacos, and tortas were all amazing! Nothing was a miss.",1
4381,"The margarita options are great - I got the mango habanero and it is delicious. The tacos are also pretty good, not the best ever but decent. I obviously didn’t get a ton, but from what I can tell the prices are really good. The tacos came with 4 tacos. I liked the salsa that came with it a lot.",1
4382,"Went here for brunch, ended up getting lunch. Great looking and tasting tortas. Good place when all other places have a wait 😆.

The churro was great but had a little more sugar then expected.",1
4383,"This is a really nice restaurant with really good and tasty food. Note that it might get pretty busy around noon and afternoon. The staff is nice and attentive.

We ordered the almost naked nachos with spicy poblanos and queso fresco, and then a set of beef tacos and another one of vegetarian tacos. Everything tasted really good and it was very flavorful. For drinks, we tried the XOCO margarita and the americola.

The portions are bigger than you might get from similar restaurants, so make sure you keep some room for dessert.",1
4384,"Great place! We enjoyed everything we ordered from the margarita to the churros! Their seasonal special pork sandwich was so good! The sauce was great and enough! Their chicken sandwich was very delicious, too! The prices are very reasonable and their service is very good, too! Our waiter was very nice and kind. We enjoyed our time at XOCO and I highly recommend this place to all of you! Especially if you are visiting Chicago!",1
4385,"A great lunch spot. The chicken sandwich is a unique deal. Sweet, savory, spicy, and $9 seems good for the area... Does not come with any sides. Love the location for meeting up outside. Guacamole is really good.",1
4386,"If you’re in the River North neighborhood looking for a quick bite to eat Xoco is the spot for you. We ordered the Ahogada, which came in a rich tomato broth, and the Shrimp a La Diabla, which was spicy, both were delicious! To top it off we ordered a side of churros with chocolate dipping sauce which came out hot, crispy and light. Overall, the tastes of our dishes were incredible and extremely reasonable for the price, definitely worth a visit!",1
4387,"Small spot (about 35 max occupancy) with counter seats and a few tables. You can see the chefs preparing the food in the open kitchen. Small menu with a few sandwiches and tacos - they also have huge corn tortillas with various toppings (the Tlayuda). This was incredible, it’s similar to what some people would call a “Mexican pizza” but better than anywhere else I’ve been. If you have been to his Fronterra restaurant the food is the same quality just in a more casual setting.",1
4388,"Since moving away from Chicago, I have fantasized about the Ahogado torta and Cochinta pibil torta and it seems that even after 5+ years, XOCO still produces amazing quality sandwiches consistently and without a hiccup. There was an issue with the soup my wife ordered and the staff resolved the issue quickly and effectively. One of the most delicious/affordable spots for authentic Mexican fare.",1
4389,"When I saw pictures of the Churros I knew I had to go here at least once. I was not disappointed and I had the best Churros I have ever eaten. The glazed Pistachio one was perfect. The other regular Churros were also great because I complemented them with the dipping sauces which were canela and chocolate. The glazed chocolate one was also good. They all tasted even more delicious with the Aztec chocolate drink. They also had more traditional food options, but I came for the Churros. Still, I definitely recommend this place. I'm not someone that likes to eat a lot of sugar, but when it comes to Churros, I'm willing to indulge.",1
4390,I was surprised how good churro sandwich tasted. The spicness of the chicken really complemented to the sweetness of the churro. I definitely enjoyed the sandwich. I wasnt much impressed by cuban though. It was okay,1
4391,"If you are in River North and are looking for an elevated street food Mexican cuisine then this is the place! Went for lunch and it was packed, the restaurant isn't that big. If you didn't know Rick Bayless is the restaurant owner so you know that's it's going to be good! Since we went on a Tuesday, we had to have tacos of course! I had the Al pastor but it was Pescado and man it was so flavorful as well as the Carnitas which were very tender. Depending on what you order the price range for 4 tacos is $10 to $18 dollars so not an everyday place to go and get tacos, with that being said would go back and try other items on the menu!",1
4392,"Extremely overrated. I ate a giant taco with some sauce on it. Taco was average and the sauces are not that good. My wife ate a kind of schnitzel, hot sauce with red onion pickles in a churro bun. Even if we are open to new tastes, this was just a sugary, hot, soured, salty weird mix. We ordered churros after and those were so greasy and the chocolate sauce was horrible. Staff was average. Highly not recommended.",0
4393,"Loved it!!
Amazing dishes for reasonable price range. Located right on the clark street in river north, which is very convenient.
Trqied their pozole and spicy churro chicken sandwich.
Absolutely amazing!
Def recommend.",1
4394,"Honestly I had an incredible time at XOCO, after debating a handful of Mexican inspired places in the area we went here for simplicity and I don’t think I’ve had a better taco in my life. The tortillas were to die for, the guacamole was so fresh, great service, and always top it off with a churro! Pictures don’t do it Justice!",1
4395,It came recommended from everyone and it did not disappoint. These Tortas were awesome!! Looking forward to returning and trying something new,1
4396,"A Rick Bayless establishment that punches above the price.  Busy with done in and take out.  The servers move fast and the kitchen is hopping. The guacamole is first rate although with the portion size was a bit larger.
Fresh ingredients and attention to detail in chopping and preparing make the food a great change from the regular fare.",1
4397,"My siblings and I grew up watching One Plate at a Time. Rick introduced us to Mexican cuisine beyond the tacos and burritos that we knew. We admired not just his passion for the food but his love and respect for the culture. Needless to say, a siblings trip to Chicago would not be complete without a stop at one of Rick’s restaurants.

We made reservations at Frontera because we wanted a full sit down experience. We had a full meal of appetizers, drinks, entrées, and dessert there. As stuffed as we were we couldn’t help but head to XOCO for some churros to end the night. While ordering we ended up getting a torta to share as well. The fact that we were so full and yet still enjoyed every last bite of our torta and churros should tell you how good it was.

We wish we had more time in the city to have an actual meal here. We’ll just have to come back again.",1
4398,"Chef Rick Bayless has the best restaurants!  XOCO was a great experience and the food was phenomenal.  The bean-to-cup authentic hot chocolate was outstanding.  The flavor was rich and it brought a smile to my face on a rainy Chicago day.  The pepito torta was also excellent.  The combination of barbacoa, caramelized onion, and cheese is one of my favorites and the tomatillo salsa brings it home.  I am always impressed by Frontera restaurants.  The service is also great as I was seated right away and my order came very quickly.  XOCO is highly recommended!",1
4399,"Excellent Mexica food fantástico tortas ahogadas, tacos de barbacoa súper and the pozole. The portion are generous. We love thé food and the staff are super friendly .",1
4400,"I saw another review praising the restaurant on their churros and hot chocolate, so I went to make sure for myself.
The milk-based hot chocolate was way too sweet; too bad there is no option to control the amount of sugar. I didn't know glazed churro would be rather big and ordered 2, asked for a takeout box for the other one. Regret not going for plain churros to avoid sugar overload.
Next time I'll come for salty items on the menu.
Also, the place mostly accepts cards, but if you are willing to pay the precise amount - they'll take cash, no change.",1
4401,Def not someplace to go if u dont have a sweet tooth. The marshmallow was pretty sweet. I liked it though and felt it was a nice place to chill and sit down with plenty of seats. More drinks than food. Kinda wish they expand the menu a bit. But good to try at least once. Very instagrammable place for pics :),1
4402,XOCO is easily one of my favorite food places down town to date. the sandwiches are amazing along with the appetizers. drinks are really good too. definitely recommend,1
4403,Easily some of the best tortas I've ever had. I wish it wasn't in the middle of Chicago but I'm just visiting so it's worth the stop.,1
4404,They've added menu service if you dine-on.  No more waiting in line.  I had the new spicy chicken churro sandwich.  Spicy + sweet at the same time!  Yum!,1
4405,"If you are looking for delicious Mexican cuisine at a reasonable price with bold flavors, you’ve found the right place.

We went on a rainy day so we couldn’t enjoy the outdoor seating but the indoor atmosphere was cozy and clean.

The waiter was very attentive and helpful, taking time to provide recommendations when requested and regularly checked in.

We started the meal with probably the best-tasting guacamole and chips I’ve had. Fresh dip full of flavor and zesty, crunchy chips.

I ordered the daily special of the Carne Asada Torta for my meal and the crunch of the bread with the assortment of toppings and quality meat was a combo I’d definitely order again.

We finished the meal with some fresh churros and chocolate sauce that were still hot from being just-made.

In short, for great-tasting Mexican flavors with a variety of offerings and a solid price, this is a great option - and one I will want to go back to.",1
4406,"5 star food. Horrible 80’s music! What the heck XOCO? You used to always have authentic Mexican music & salsa, now this is your music choice? The food is always delicious! Their churros are the best ever! The Mexican hot chocolate is amazing. The tlayudas are so SO good!  This place is a real gem!
Here and downstairs at Bar Sotano the happy hour is also wonderful. Great $8 drinks and a good selection of delicious small plates & oysters. Seriously, you can’t go wrong here.",1
4407,"This is the best Mexican food I have ever had.  I am 54 yrs old and grew up in Southern California.  I have had a lot of Mexican food.  I do not say this lightly—but I have never had this good of Mexican food (ever!!).  No words can describe the food here.  Incredible taste, flavors—the chicken tacos are out of this world.  And I mean it—never had food this good.  I am super picky and critical when it comes to Mexican food (ask my wife who says I’ve liked just a handful of places—but this restaurant is the best ever!!  I had no idea about this place.  I could eat here for the rest of my life and be extremely happy.  Nothing we ordered was less than out of this world delicious.  One more day in Chicago as a visitor, just wish I knew about this.  It’s so good that I plan to return to Chicago soon just to eat here again.  Out of 5 stars this is 100.",1
4408,"Ordered a Jamaica ($3.50) and a gunthorp ham tlayuda ($14). Both items came out relatively quickly and service was pleasant. Tlayuda was large enough to share and the masa tostada was very light and crispy, the ham added a nice salty kick and the dispersed peanuts and broccoli helped balance the savory cheese. Jaimaca was refreshing with a light tartness. Would try again with a group to try different items on the menu.

Busy around 1PM on Saturday. A 20% service charge is added to all bills and fortunately they add the service charge only to your subtotal of items ordered pre-tax. You can opt to add an additional tip to the added service charge if you desire.",1
4409,"This is an amazing restaurant that is known for their tortas. Fresh baked bread and amazing filling. I had their Pepito, which was a short rib sandwich.",1
4410,"We got takeout from Xoxo. The food was very flavorful and was good quality. The short rib tacos were surprisingly spicy, so they did not work for our kids, but my wife and I enjoyed them. The churro chicken sandwich was an interesting and tasty item and definitely worth a try if you dig the sweet, savory, and slightly spicy combo of flavors.  It was a bit pricey for takeout, but not outrageous for the quality of food and the fact that it is downtown Chicago.",1
4411,"Prompt n nice servers. Had Fall Tlayuda, ribs tacos. Delish! If you get the chocolate espresso make sure to stir as choc ends up at the bottom.",1
4412,"A chicken sandwich with a churro bun....  What? The waves of flavor from sweet to hot were amazing. Nothing subtle here. Dessert and lunch all in one. We sat on the street, hidden by a sheild of plants and flowers. So much fun, and an experience we won't soon forget.",1
4413,Food was amazing! Servers were incredible.  The carnita tortas were mouth watering along with the short rib tacos.  Traditional churros and cheesecake are a must!,1
4414,"Stopped here for lunch and got the Thursday Torta special and an order of Chicken Tacos, everything came out fast and excellent can not wait too come back and try more",1
4415,"Very delicious Mexican food, cozy place and fun place to sit.
Liked the Guacamole taste style, and chicken sandwich.
The only reason, I give 4stars is because of the unwelcoming host, but we enjoyed talking to the our server and manager.",1
4416,Food&drinks were good. Serving staff was so sweet and restaurant had overall good ambiance.,1
4417,My first time here and I went with the frequently mentioned Ahogada torta which was a great call. I would definitely come back!,1
4418,"We heard about Tlayuda from XOCO's Facebook page. Let me tell you, it is fantastic! There's option to add chorizo or chicken, we chose to get one of each. Both were delicious. Next time, I don't plan to share. 😁",1
4419,Xoco is located in a vibrant restaurant area making a great spot you are exploring by foot .Saturday lunch hours Xoco features their chilaquiles! Also they have really nice churros which you have at any point of the week. My experience with Saturday lunch hours is that it is pretty busy as it host a vibrant atmosphere with people waiting on the line and on weekdays tends to be faster to get in.,1
4420,"good goat torta, bread was a bit too hard tho. customizable guac us such a great concept. chocolate churros were to die for",1
4421,Excellent food and fare! I really enjoyed the drinkable hot chocolate which was spiced and sweetened perfectly. Great for a hot day as well! Only suggestion is to turn the music a bit down for the outside seating as it can be blaring near the speakers.,1
4422,"flawless restaurant experience, amazing food flavor and quality, fast service for a quick Friday lunch, very reasonable prices for River North. can I give this place 6 stars? cant wait til i get to try more off the menu but the loaded guacamole cobb was a perfectly portioned and balanced salad.",1
4423,"Excellent food and filling portions for each dish. Definitely go for the churro and cajeta after your meal! The servers are attentive, the environment is comfortable with great lighting for pictures, and every dish we ordered was flavorful and balanced. Will definitely come again next time I'm in Chicago!",1
4424,"Very nice place, food is good service is good as well would recommend",1
4425,Tacos are good and really affordable! The sandwich is something I've never tried before but it's also good(a little too spicy for me tho).,1
4426,"absolutely fantastic, casual but great quality and nothing left wanting. Highly recommend the chicken tinga tacos.",1
4427,"Smaller than expected and the menu is rather limited, but the tacos were delicious and flavorful! The margarita was on point too. Service was friendly and right there when needed. Would definitely go again!",1
4428,"My boyfriend and I stopped by here the other day and picked up some food to go since it was close by and had heard good things. However, after getting home and looking over everything, it wasn’t the stellar experience we were hoping for, but wasn’t terrible.

Chips and salsa- 2/5: honestly, we were both a bit surprised by this. First, we had ordered extra salsa with the order, but they only gave us one of each. With that, they were extremely small, along with the chips that came with it. The red and habanero salsa were good, however, the green lacked flavor.

Chicken Milanese Torta- 1/5:  we got this based on a recommendation and were really disappointed. The slaw that was on the sandwich was very tart, with that, the chicken on the torta was extremely dry, which made the whole thing hard to eat.

Gringa Torta: 4/5: Now, this is a seasonal special, however, if you are stopping by I highly recommend getting this one. The pork was cooked very well and everything that came with it was fantastic. Honestly, I would go back for this Torta only.

Overall, Xoco is nice to have by and the food is decent, however, I just think we got a bad batch of a few things. I will probably give it another try since it is so close by.",1
4429,"Excellent Mexican fare well spiced and very flavorful. The star was the Short Rib Tlayuda and the taco carnitas. We ate inside and all the food came out immediately as it was prepared including the churros at the end. The chicken tacos were okay but nothing special. A unique twist on guacamole fully loaded with toppings. The margarita was too sweet for my preference.
There was a short line to get in at 6:00 on a Saturday. A very long line had formed as we left at 7:00.",1
4430,"I don't get to the city a lot and have not been to XOCO in over a year but when I had the chance I grabbed it. The line was out the door midday which tells you something. I knew I wanted the Pepito sandwich and the 25 minute wait was well worth it. Even better than I remembered. Delicious crust bread, cheese, pork and sauce. Add my Modello beer and ot could not have been better. Service was great, food outstanding. I'm already thinking about my next visit.",1
4431,Good tacos and decent portion. The tortas are great too.,1
4432,"I had brunch here on a Saturday and my experience was great.  The breakfast enchiladas I had were fairly mild spice-wise, but the flavors were very well balanced.  The hot chocolate was also a great choice.  They had a mixed drink of coke and espresso on the menu that I had to try due to the novelty of it to me, and it was also a great surprise; the coffee really takes over the drink's flavors, but it does get the coke's sweetness and carbonation.  My friend was very happy with his torta and tlayuda too.",1
4433,"Wow. We were worried that Rick Bayless was dumbing down his food for reasonable prices, but we were amazed by the quality at these prices.  The tacos were great tasting with plenty of ingredients. The smoked ham sandwich was outstanding.",1
4434,"Small restaurant with a couple of tables inside, they play very loud music so if you are trying to chat ask for a table outside, the food is good, I recommend trying the Champurrado and Churros!

What we order:
Spicy Chicken Churro Sandwich
crispy churro “bun,” crispy-crunchy chicken breast, arbol hot sauce, chipotle mayo, Napa cabbage, pickled red onion.

Crispy Chicken Caldo
nuggets of crispy chicken milanesa, shiitake mushrooms, shredded cabbage & chayote, red chile-miso broth.

Champurrado
AKA Mexico City Thick. Whole milk + corn masa + chocolate + sweet spices.

Almendrado
Fresh ground chocolate and almond milk.",1
4435,The service was friendly but slow.  They charged us extra for a little cup of green salsa.  But the real disappointment was when the bill arrived we were told that there was a 20% service charge.  No explanation was given.  When given the digital device there was also a place to add a tip.  I don’t think so!  Not a happy ending to an other wise nice meal.,1
4436,"Good food, not too expensive. Had the fully loaded guac and a sandwich, guac was definitely the highlight",1
4437,"Everything we ate here was fresh, packed with flavor, and visually appealing. Chips, guac and salsa had some heat and you could tell the guac was homemade. Carne asada torta was a delicious spicy sandwich (using the salsa) and the bread and meat were excellent. Vegetable Tacos were devoured immediately - an excellent blend of sweet and spicy inside. The churros with caramel dip were light and sweet and fried to perfection.",1
4438,The food was delicious! Great location,1
4439,This place is small but Good food was tasty,1
4440,Really excellent.  We had the Smoked Pork Tlayudas (aka Mexican pizza).  Tasty the black bean spread has a touch of earthy sweetness.  I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t get soggy as it is cracker thin masa base.  Finished off our quick lunch with the churros and chocolate that is reminiscent of the Spanish version we had in Madrid.,1
4441,I’m sorry two stars is the most I can get for tacos. But for sure these tacos are the worst tacos that I ever tasted in my whole life. For a restaurant in downtown Chicago that serve tacos like this I don’t know what to say. Taco El Jalisciense in my opinion has better tacos than you guys.,0
4442,Wonderful fresh and tasty food. Great atmosphere and friendly service,1
4443,"It's already 7pm when we came here. It's good to know that they open at this hour. It's small but has a unique interior. Waiter approached and welcomed us and gave us the menu. Lot of dishes are on their menu. She also recommended their special food.

We ordered Churros, Chicharrones and Spicy Churro Chicken Sandwich and some drinks.

Churros are good when you dip in the homemade chocolate shot or cajeta. You can have it when you add an extra charge.

Their Chicharrones are crispy and have a great taste. I like its saltiness and it comes with some sauces and a piece of lemon.

Spicy Churro chicken sandwich is the best. It's spicy but it's sweet. The cheese and mayo is perfect for the chicken. Overall it's delicious and crunchy. I would love to buy another of this spicy Churro chicken for take out. Can't wait to come back here.",1
4444,"The food is great at an affordable price.  I had the carnitas tacos and they were the best I've ever had.  The tacos were also larger than other places usually serve with a lot of meat and you get 4 of them instead of the typical 3 other restaurants tend to serve. The margarita I had was above average and the chips and salsa were good, but nothing to write home about.

I have to subtract one star because at XOCO, they do not accept cash payments which seems pretentious and also inconvenient for some customers.  They do accept credit cards and apps like Apple and Google Pay though.",1
4445,"A good place for having Mexican food. Although it is not served as the authentic one, the taste is quite good and the service is great for an affordable price. I totally recommend this place.",1
4446,"I was looking forward to eating here but it just missed for us. Chips and guacamole was good but the sauvignon blanc, tortilla and shrimp torte sandwich was just so-so. It was an early dinner so maybe it was that. Patio seating was also awkward.",1
4447,"Good thing I live 40 miles west of here otherwise I'd be here ten times a week.
Loved the Ahogada sauce so much i bought some to take home!!  We ate here in a frigid Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy.
We had a traditional margarita and wine... yum!  The eggplant sandwich pictured below is my go to. The bread is toasted and thin.
We visit this place every time we're in the city.  Great job Rick and staff... you all rock!!",1
4448,"Very disappointed & upsetting experience. My girlfriend & I came from out of state on vacation excited to try ‘XOCO’ (we talked about it for weeks). Upon arriving we were treated as if we were an inconvenience to the staff.
We were sat & not once did our server check on us. We waited 15 minutes after eating to be greeted with the bill & 20% service fee.
I have no problem leaving a tip (20%+) but to have the experience & service we did, it was a slap in the face.

We ate this location 8/25/2022
Around 4:00 p.m.",0
4449,"Beware: they charge an unexpected 20% extra fee. The waiter says it’s so they can pay more than minimum wage. This deception makes the prices very high. The food is good, but unhealthy. Service is good!",1
4450,"I was a little disappointed in this restaurant. My tortilla soup wasn't nearly as good as those i had in Tuscon. I love Rick Beyless's cooking and was eager to try his food. Next time I'm in Chicago,  I'll eat at Frontera.",1
4451,"My first Rick Bayless experience, and probably my last. The service was pretty terrible, I had wait a very long time for water, a very long time for the check, and then I was slapped with a mandatory service fee (not the tip)?! What is that? The fee for choosing to eat food at your restaurant?! The service was horrible, and the food was just ok. The seasonal pumpkin tres leche was VERY good though, much better than the entrée. Just was not a great experience, and not a fan of a surprise service fee that was not advised of before ordering and eating. So, you know, basically fraud. Won't go back.",0
4452,"Fantastic Mexican food. Ordered the chilaquiles verdes, and the torta ahogada and it was phenomenal.
Guac as the appetizer was super good with the pork. I could go on but it’s best if you try it out yourself.
Hats off to the chef",1
4453,"A top notch venue for casual authentic Mexican cuisine by celebrity chef Rick Bayless. Cocinita Pibil torta is succulent (Thursdays only), the beef Barbacoa tacos and the chicken Tinga tacos are very tasty, and the tlayuda with chorizo was out of this world. The staff is very helpful and the service is courteous and efficient. Can’t recommend it enough",1
4454,I had the Cauliflower Tlayuda with chorizo added. It was the most delicious meal I have had in a Mexican restaurant in Chicago. The habanero margarita  paired so well with dinner absolutely fantastic,1
4455,"This was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life. It was completely unexpected too. We went on a whim from a suggestion from a friend. It definitely did not disappoint. The things the chef is able to do with vegetables, it's crazy. And I am the furthest thing from a vegetarian. We had a churros for dessert, pistachio glazed and regular with soft serve. They aren't pictures unfortunately, but they were absolutely incredible. You have to go here, you have to try it all. And luckily the prices so affordable you'll be able to do just that.",1
4456,Giving 5 stars for service.  Accidently ordered a chicken sandwich wedged between a donut.  Horrid!!!!!!.  The manager was kind enough to trade it for a normal sandwich. It was entirely my mistake. Thank you for that.  I'll be back.,1
4457,This place had the best guacamole I have ever had!!!! It was so delicious! I also really enjoyed the pozole. My husband got the torta ahogada and he really liked it.,1
4458,"Margarita was watered down

Did not like the 15% service charge and asking for a tip after? What is the reason of the 15% service charge? Every Chicago restaurant serves the same way? Nothing special or attentive service compared to a steak house/seafood place.",0
4459,"Not authentic Mexican food. Different but the food was not to my liking. Most of the food was salty or lacked flavor. Service was good and prices ok, but I wouldnt return.",1
4460,"This restaurant is pretty cool! Lines can be long  but they usually go by fast. Food is very good and very VERY close to the authentic. It is the first time in a long time since I’ve had almost 100% authentic Mexican food. They obviously add their little touch to make the food unique but you can definitely tell they want to make is as close as the real deal! my favorite part of this restaurant is hands down the music. It’s sooo good and gets you moving and in a happy mood (if you listen to it). As someone who comes from Mexico, this restaurant gives me a short and pleasant sense that I’m in Mexico :).",1
4461,"Very nice! Quaint even.... this was my first visit and the staff served us fast and friendly with smiles... they were attentive, patient and knowledgeable about their products offered.",1
4462,"Food, service, prices ok in general. The tortilla soup not great although they do try. It needs less salt and more chile and tortilla strips a bit soggy. . RB should get a recipe the next time he visits Mexico City. The mandatory 20% tip is abusive.

Today 10/22/22 dropped 1 star from last visit. Campechana torta was ok. Mango and lemon drink not as good as last time. Very crowded so I guess workers are tired. Service takes a hit.",0
4463,"From the same team behind Frontera Grill, XOCO is a much more casual and affordable (for River North standards) option for a Mexican meal close to the Mag Mile. The menu is pretty large, making it hard for those that are always undecided about what to have. We ended up picking a naked guacamole, an Ahogada (imagine a carnitas sandwich dipped into tomato sauce) and some chicken tacos. They were all delicious and more than sufficient for 2 people!",1
4464,"Visited Xoco as we were stopping in the Aloft hotel a block along and had seen the place reviewed by Action Bronson.  Enjoyed French toast for breakfast with a side of bacon and coffee.  Toast had an almost custard like texture which was unexpected but made a nice change.  To be honest a single side of bacon would be enough for two people.  Very reasonably priced, spotlessly clean.  Would recommend a visit.",1
4465,"Delicious food! Got the torta ahogoda, really really good. Recommend getting the green chile sauce as a side, pairs well with the broth!
Also got churros w/ cajeta & chocolate sauce. To be honest the chocolate sauce was alright, but the cajeta stole my heart. Was delicious with churros (light sugar!!)",1
4466,"Rick does it again! The food was awesome! We had the loaded guacamole, Cubano and I had the Saturday goat meat special. Simply amazing, the food is perfectly spiced and cooked. This is a more casual/ quick food atmosphere compared to his other spots. And just as good! Went on a Saturday night and the wait time was less than 10 minutes. Can’t wait to go back!!",1
4467,"We actually came here on a whim and it was some of the best food we had during our stay. We got the milanesa torta and pepito torta and churros for dessert. The food is amazing, something I could never make at home. The staff was so friendly and helpful, even as we showed up just before closing. Thank you guys for a great experience!",1
4468,"Came here to grab a quick lunch and was not disappointed! The moment you enter, you are greeted and given a table number to mention with your order so they know where to bring your food. Service was great - the hostess even let my friend join me at the front of the line when he arrived late, so we could place our order together. We chose to sit outside in the “patio seating” which is very comfy on a nice day. Despite how busy the restaurant was, our food came out quick. We had the pork arabe torta, grilled sweet corn calda (soup), chocolate cafe con leche and then a hazelnut glazed churro to go. I loved the torta! The pork is soft and right amount of patty and the sauce has a nice kick. The bread is crunchy and satisfying. Good portion size. The sweet corn calda was also tasty. Would have been nice with a side of bread or something to help fill up. The chocolate cafe con leche tastes more strongly of coffee than chocolate but has a chocolate aftertaste. I actually really like it because it’s not too sweet. Finally, we had the glazed churro, which must be made fresh because it took some time to come out. It tastes good but down side the glaze is not dried so it would be messy to eat with your hands.",1
4469,"Cute little place in the middle of river north. We did not have a meal but their margaritas, churos, and dip were great. They let you sample the margaritas and palomas so you don’t have to commit to an entire drink before you try it. They do not do frozen margaritas but rather on the rocks. I did not ask what tequila or mescal they use but it is quit smooth.

There is not a lot of space to sit so it can get busy. However, it is worth a short wait if you want a more casual but good eating experience.",1
4470,"This Mexican restaurant was okay. Seating is a bit confusing. The hosted would like us to order food first before taking a seat however we were carrying lots of luggage during the time which is not practical while standing on a line. The churros were just okay. The flavor wasn't what I expected it to be. I got the pistachio churros (I love pistachio everything) but I was not mind blown when trying it. On a brighter note, the sandwiches were good.",1
4471,"This place was just okay. Guac and drinks were good but food was just ok. Nothing crazy. There was a 20% surcharge that caught us off guard so keep that in mind. Again, it’s ok but nothing I’d go to again.",1
4472,"Amazing Mexican food in Chicago. Try the carnitas soup. It was so refreshing with very clean yet flavorful broth. Great for cold weather.
The churros is so delicious no wonder it is famous.",1
4473,"Came in to have dessert this last visit and of course I had the churros with chocolate dip. Unfortunately they only had sweet potato ice cream and since I'm not used to that flavor so I didn't have ice cream.  We also had classic hot chocolate and it was awesome. And also took more dessert to go. You order the food and pay for it upfront and then someone will bring your food to your table. I like the space and the ambiance. According to The window sign, breakfast on Saturdays is made by the chef but I don't know.",1
4474,"Quality of the food was great. Felt like it was kind of pricey for what it was, especially the Margaritas. We got Guacamole to start, then Carnitas Tacos & a Pepito Torta, + two Margaritas, $58 dollars total

Even though I felt the price was high, still give them 5 stars because I want to go back and try some dishes I saw on other tables. The",1
4475,The churros are fantastic. Highly recommend getting the chocolate dipping sauce. Cute low key restaurant.,1
4476,"Food was great, period. Don't think any further and definitely give this place a try. I came for the first time with a friend and the food was full of spices and flavors. It was all delicious and we left feeling great!",1
4477,If you can’t afford to pay your employees - close your restaurant. 15% service charge before tip so that you can meet minimum wage? - what a joke. Rick Bayless should be ashamed of himself.,0
4478,"Fantastic restaurant on a cold Chicago night if you are looking for something warm and sweet warm your soul. Come to XOCO for a amazing, pure cup of hot cocoa and the warmest, crispy, fluffy churros around. Their hot chocolate is made by literally pouring hot water on their homemade chocolate. Pure, rich, and extremely fresh compared to processed varieties you can find in stores. Their churros are on another level. Sure they are a little smaller than the $1 Costco churros, but these are crispier on the outside and fluffy on the inside due to their smaller diameter. I did not get the chocolate dipping sauce, and I don’t regret it. The churros themselves were covered in an abundance of sugar and cinnamon, and dipping the churro in the excess cinnamon/sugar mixture is fantastic. Highly, highly recommend for a late night treat.",1
4479,"Came with a party of 9 so I don’t remember the name of every dish. I had the ahogada, and it’s phenomenal. Also, the churros are made in house and so is the chocolate dip!! The staff are super friendly as well!",1
4480,"Good food , watch out for a 15% service fee added to your bill, they didn't tell us, I didn't appreciate that at all. Manager removed the fee when I questioned it on the receipt.",1
4481,The spicy churro chicken sandwich!! It makes you forget all of the crazy sports takes Rick's brother Skip has had in the past.,1
4482,"I went there and waited 20 minutes just to get my dish, the restaurant was empty-ish but anyway after a long wait, I tried the torta ahogada, it had nothing to do with a real torta ahogada, pork meat is not supposed to shred, it has to be covered in salsa, it goes with lime spiced onions at least and hey one last thing, when I ordered I said not mild but very spicy/hot whatever, after the 20 minute wait they brought it and the sauce was just plain tomato sauce then I asked one of the servers hey I asked the torta to be very spicy can you get me hot sauce, he brought a little container with a red sauce, again very different from what it's supposed to be and of course not spicy at all as I finished it al.

Very disappointed, definitely the restaurant should change the name of the dish or do it right, it looked and tasted like a one youtube-based dish at best.",0
4483,Absolutely delicious. Our group ordered each of the tacos and they were all equally good.  Beware - the short ribs are a bit spicy!  The limonada is also very good - very tart!,1
4484,"Really tasty quick food with a Mexican twist theme by the legendary Rick Bayless. Had the Xoco salad and Milanesa sandwich with the Churro sundae. A quality small meal without breaking the bank. Easy to get in, grab a seat and food came out within 8 minutes.",1
4485,"Food is fantastic in this small eatery. Opportunity to eat in the restaurant or take out.

Thier Tortas are fantastic, they are wood oven made, tons of flavor and you really just can't go wrong. Also, a trip to Xoco is not complete without a order of thier churro's.

Only down side is because of the smaller size, peak eating times can get very busy and crowded. So I would plan on an off hour if possible.",1
4486,"If you search for best Bayless tacos, XOCO is the top result and I don't disagree. Short rib tacos were the perfect blend of braised tenderness with a seared crust. The heat is in the salsa should you choose to put some on, but it was not overpowering.

I finished with the churros and chocolate dip. Worth it. Just go. Enjoy.",1
4487,Very delicious for my first time here. I ordered the Ahodaga and pork belly vermicelli. Both were very delicious. The flavors really mesh together well and are something to be remembered. The differences in the texture are pleasing to the pallet. Definitely a place to try if you’re in Chicago.,1
4488,"We got Huevos Rancheros and a Breakfast Taco and a Classic Chocolate. Fast service, fresh ingredients. Open air kitchen let’s you know how clean this place is. We went at 9:30 on a Saturday morning and there was no wait. Friendly staff.  Cheap too - our bill was just over $20",1
4489,Nice place.  The Ahogada Torta is very good with the hot arbol chili broth.  I also had the Aztec hot chocolate which was a very pleasant surprise.,1
4490,"Seemed a little disorganized when I entered.  It's counter service,  but I had to wait at the door for someone to tell me what table number I should give at the counter.   Everything else went much smoother.  Ordered the churros, a bit too hard, so they were just okay.  Restaurant is in a good area with many bustling options for food.  I'd probably give this place another chance to wow me, but for now it was just okay.",1
4491,"I must have eaten here once a week.

My go to is coctel rojo, michelada with Victoria, chicaronnes, and milanesa.  Perfect!

Their tiyualdas were delicious too. Their pozoles was ok. Every taco was great esp the carnitas. Their salsa is also great quality.

I ate their churros and it was great but never had room for more.",1
4492,The food is outstanding. One of the few places I'll go back to over and over again. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,1
4493,"We’ve been here about 3 times already and these TACOS are just amazing, great service and friendly staff.. I went last Wednesday to try the tacos al pastor but I wasn’t impressed.. I still love all the other tacos and most of the items on the menu, excellent Mexican food.",1
4494,"This restaurant was amazing!!!! The breakfast chilaquiles with pork belly were the best I've ever had. The plate is large and you'll finish it if you're super hungry but if you don't finish it, your left overs will taste even more amazing. I also had the Mexicana hot chocolate (champurrado) and it was also so delicious. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious breakfast. I'm sure they have other delicious options however I've only been here once. I will definitely be going back many more times. I must mention that the staff is super cheerful and inviting...and attentive. Their environment is so cozy and they play great music in the background.",1
4495,"An amazing lunch experience. I had the short rib torta, pictured.  My wife had carnitas en mole torta. Both were fantastic but the carnitas were special",1
4496,"I really liked the ambiance & outdoor seating however the food tasted sour. I had Baja Chicken Sandwich with Chips & Salsa. Their green & red sauces were also sour, not my palate. Few people may like it but for me it was OK.",1
4497,"My experience was just okay. The goat barbacoa doesn’t taste fresh. And apparently, the the cook doesn’t believe in gloves; He shredded the frozen goat meat with his bare hands.",1
4498,"Cool, casual and relaxed place serving authentic Mexican food.

I was excited to get to try this place because of the famous chef that owns it, and it didn't disappoint!

Here are some items I tried and how I did like them:

-The carnitas soup was authentic and one of the best I've ever had. I highly recommend it.

-The tacos were very good, although the tortillas were, as in every other American place..cold, as opposed to the real Mexican restaurants where the tortillas are served hot with your tacos. And I would give more sauce with those tacos, tho!

-The shrimp cocktail was delicious.

-The margarita needed a little bit more effort and flavor.

-The Churros, with the Mexican caramel sauce, were the best churros I've ever had in my life, and I've eaten churros in various parts of Mexico, so I know what I'm talking about.

Overall, with the exception of the spoon being too large for me to eat the soup, me having to go to the front counter to ask for a regular sized one, and for me having to go again later on for some tortillas for my soup, because that’s the way we eat it in Mexico, my experience here was great, and I will comeback pretty soon! No place is perfect, but this was very close.

P.s. The manager was very helpful and was always helping everyone. It got my attention how hardworking he was and how proud he was of working there. He was the tall hispanic manager. I don’t remember his name. Good job!",1
4499,"For a Rick Bayless fan, this restaurant is his fast food version of his upscale restaurants. I love his version of street food. The churros are delicious!!! The tortas and guacamole are scrumptious!!! They have eat in, to go, and delivery service.
The food here is phenomenal!",1
4500,"Really good,  I tried thier Taco Carnitas
Gunthorp golden pork Carnitas, house guacamole, fresh onions and cilantro *4 Tacos per order, handmade corn tortilla.  Tasty",1
4501,Scrumptios flavors. I ordered the Tinga tacos with an order of loaded guacamole...mmm soo good and their tortilla chips have a hint of lime flavor that won't disappoint. To drink I had the classic chocolate drink. Both were delicious. The classic chocolate took me back to memories of when I use to visit relatives in Mexico and they would bring out the pan dulce with the choco coffee.,1
4502,"You lost me a customer. I ordered from you plenty of times but today your hostess behave disrespectful towards me and my father.
We arrived to the restaurant at 5:00 p.m. and we wanted to order take out. We wanted to order: a pozole soup, guacamole, eggplant sandwich, crispy gunthrope chicken sandwich, etc.
My father and I wanted to sit in the restaurant while we wait for our take-out order. The restaurant was kind of empty and many tables and seats were available. The hostess said to us we cannot sit in the restaurant and wait for our order. She expected us to stand outside and wait. There’s nothing more rude than saying to people to stand while waiting for their orders. We cannot stand for a long period of time, it’s disgraceful.
I loved the food in your restaurant but because the hostess disrespected me and my dad, I’ll not order from here again.",0
4503,"Some of the best tortas I've ever had. The pork belly torta was rich but still light, and the torta ahogado was like nothing I've ever eaten. The churros had an odd savory taste to them, which I assume came from the frying oil, but they were still very good.",1
4504,"Great Ahogado Torta for lunch today! The soup that comes with for dipping made me wish I had more sandwich. A few things were missing in my order (utensils, ingredient instructions) but I still really enjoyed this and would return for takeout lunch again.",1
4505,Fantastic! The churro chicken sandwich and soup is great! Good service too and friendly.,1
4506,"So incredibly disappointed here. The service was very good as was my glad of wine (first red on the list) but the food was a huge disappointment! The sauce if the coctel Verde was good at first but needed every drop of my line wedge squeezed on it. The shrimp and scallops were completely tasteless. The chicharronnes were served with hot sauce and cheese, version of fried pork skin nachos. But they were cold, stale and completely tasteless. The chicharronnes tasted like Korean twibap (puffed rice cakes) with no exaggeration. Such a disappointment, Rick!",0
4507,"This was a  recommendation from my old chef for the churros and hot chocolate and boy was it good. The apple bread pudding and guacamole was good, but nothing to go crazy over. A tip, dont let the hot chocolate sit too long. When its cold, its no good",1
4508,Spicy chicken churo sandwich was amazing. Everything just worked together,1
4509,"Delicious and fresh. For anyone who wants churros without the thick coating of sugar, it is possible to ask for that.",1
4510,Xoco is wonderful!! I’m a huge fan of the “fully dressed” guacamole (see pic) - this is what I order every single time. Their horchata drink is also delicious (it’s a cinnamon milk like drink). Today I got a carne asada (steak) sandwich. The waitress and the staff were all polite and helpful.,1
4511,"I can strongly recommend the Baja Chicken tortilla. I couldn't stop making a deal over how flavorful it was.
The soup bowls left me unimpressed, but I'll absolutely be back to try another sandwich.

Worth a visit if you haven't yet tried this take on Mexican street food.",1
4512,"I loved their churros and chocoholic deep. I did not like pistachio churros. Their coffee is okay. You need to order at the counter but you get seated and they will bring your food to you. I cannot give advice for the food, because I haven’t tried it.",1
4513,"One of my most favorite places in the City. Rick Bayless has to be my favorite chef ever after eating at each of his establishments. Xoco is not to be missed. So yourself a favor and stop in. Sandwiches, soups, deserts are all wonderful.",1
4514,"Better Fresher Chips at Taco Bell.  Seriously, when this kind of price point restaurant is serving old chips from a bag, its given up.  The Salad I ordered was old as well.  Lastly the Chix sandwich was just rubbery.  I hate Taco Bell, but at least they care a little.",0
4515,Delicious food and drinks at a great price. Service is also very quick. I recommend the Carnitas soup and the churros. And definitely get some guacamole to start!,1
4516,"My experience at Xoco was quite underwhelming and disappointing.  I had the torta de choriqueso.  It was very small.  The chorizo lacked a kick and there was not much of it.  I also had the hibiscus margarita, but the pour was so light it might as well have been plain jamaica (hibiscus flower drink). My daughters both had the pork pozole.  The caldo was oily and tasted very watered down.  Its color suggested the same.  The only things that were okay were the pulpo pibil tlayuda (which my wife had) and the churros. The tlayuda was large and tasty and the octopus was nicely prepared. Perhaps it had too much cheese, weighing the airy tortilla down. The churros were good, but it is hard to mess up fried bread covered in sugar.  I will not be going back.  It is a high priced but only mediocre, if that, meal.  I don't recommend it at all.",0
4517,"One of the best foods i have had. A great American take on Mexican food. The best thing here is the salsa you would get with the chips. Perfect for low budget and you never compromise on the taste. Good drink, keep it simple. Thanks Rick Bayless",1
4518,"20% service charge added automatically.
Tortilla soup was on saltier side…had too much fried tortillas on them
Tlayuda was unique and good.",0
4519,Always fantastic tortas. The ahogado is my favourite by far and is a regular treat. Everything is well made and authentic in flavour and incredibly fresh.,1
4520,"This was my first time to Xoco.  We ordered the Pepito  torta and the Friday special, Shrimp torta....with Churro's of course!!!  The food was AMAZING.  I was not expecting such great flavors for a takeout type of place.  The head Chef, Kris, was SUPER friendly and very accommodating.  We had to catch a plane and asked for silverware.  He gave us actual silverware....not plastic!!!  What a GREAT place.  Everyone was super friendly....will be back soon!!!!  Thanks Kris!!!",1
4521,"Delicious food, best I have had so far this year! The service is excellent! Please order the guacamole!",1
4522,"Stopped by here on a recommendation. After a few drinks from 3 Dots and a Dash, just around the corner, we were in dire need of some good grub!

Service was fast. We had the super tasty chips and salsa. Both the red and and green salsa were fresh and tasty with just the right amount of heat. The short rib tacos are tender, flavorful and riquísimos! You get four per order. The chicken tinga tacos were also delicious.

Be sure to get a house Margarita too! 👌🏽",1
4523,The Torta Cubana was Delicious! Loved every bit of it. The sauce the give you is not hot but it leaves a nice warm numness feeling after you eat it. The Torta ahogada was very good as well.,1
4524,"I'm sad. Our hotel was directly across from XOCO and we were super excited to try it out. We arrived around 6:00 and the place was pretty empty. We were seated on opposite sides of a curved cement wall even though there were plenty of seats facing into windows. We politely asked to move and were equally politely reseated.  After  a good long wait a wait person came and took our drink order - a margarita and a water.  20 minutes later we snagged another staff person and inquired about the drinks and ordering. Our wait person returned and asked to take our order and we asked if we would be getting our drinks. Her response - Of Course.  We ordered guac (excellent) and it came immediately. We asked about our drinks again to that server and 25 minutes later our wait person returned - with no drinks. Her literal response  ""I was busy with something else."" She was then shocked that we did not order entrees since we had to get to a show by 8:00. I really wanted to love this experience but alas. I'm giving all 3 stars to the guac experience.",1
4525,"Small eat in area but they seat quickly and you can drink while you wait.
Milanesa torta was delicious and the Cuban torta was just ehh, over done with the bacon.",1
4526,Awesome food; We were able to just walk in there with my daughter and wife and had such a great food. Definitely recommend.,1
4527,"Barbacoa tacos were juicy and the Short Rib Torta hit the spot, careful with the habanero sauce- it’s authentic and it will
burn your soul.",1
4528,The rib taco tastes good. The taco sauce is a little bit spicy but promote eating. The sandwich is good but little expensive.,1
4529,"This restaurant has elevated every Mexican dish on the menu; very delicious food, definitely a place to return.",1
4530,Consistently excellent and fast food with great atmosphere. The sandwiches are the best things on the menu.,1
4531,"We had a party of 3 and wouldn’t get seated because we had one joining later, even though all tables were for parties of 4. Hostess couldn’t understand basic math and wasn’t willing to seat us even though it wouldn’t have made a difference. Extremely bad attitude and I won’t be visiting again.",0
4532,"Trying Rick Bayless's Mexican restaurant...excellent food! No table service so if you need that, pick the other place Frontera grill. Quick counter service and food is delicious. Churros were excellent too. We ordered guacamole, carnitas and chips with salsa and plenty of margaritas.",1
4533,Very good food. Been there about four times and the food was excellent every time. Enjoyed sitting at the patio.,1
4534,"The sandwich was delicious, however the overall experience was below average. The whole system with placing orders and getting a table is very confusing. Some of the “tables” are 18”  selves on the wall, basically you are almost touching the wall with your face when biting your sandwich. Music was too loud",0
4535,Xoco has great food!   Tried tlayuda and pozole on our last visit.  Definitely a great place to get a quick tasty bite!,1
4536,"Food was delicious and service was great and attentive. When I first came here I ordered the Aztec hot chocolate and was a little over my head on the chili level. The manager kindly gave me a cup of milk to help me regain my tastebuds again 😅. Also, it's a great spot especially if the other Frontera restaurant is too long of a wait😉",1
4537,Made it just in time for desayuno. Had chilaquiles and a churro with a chocolate shot. It was fantastic. The fresh jalepeño on the chilaquiles cured my allergies for the day 🔥.,1
4538,The food here is soooooo good! We came during the middle of a lunch rush and the service was very fast and everyone was super nice. They also have Mexican Squirt. I highly recommend the Tuesday special (carne asada torta) if you happen to go on a Tuesday!,1
4539,I had a chorizo torta. The food itself was really solid but fairly small and relatively pricy for a small sandwich. For the same money you can get twice as much food at other Mexican restaurants. I had a counter seat which was a little cramp (I'm a tall guy). Overall a really solid meal that I would definitely recommend.,1
4540,I waited for a table for a long time and right  before getting sitted they gave it to someone  else. Please don't  make a commitment that you can't fulfill and have preference over customers that just showed up.,0
4541,"I can't visit Chicago without stopping into this cafe style Mexican fare. Astounding food, great staff, and fantastic desserts and coffee. 10/10 would reccomend.",1
4542,"We opted for outdoor dining.
The staff was very helpful and kind.
One of the best Mexican restaurants I have tried.",1
4543,"Stopped by for churros and hot chocolate without any reservations, and we weren’t disappointed. Tasty churros, with options for sauce, and various options for hot chocolate (depending on how strong you like it!) Very friendly, efficient service. Would definitely go back!",1
4544,"Delicious. Amazing. ❤️ Giant meal...you probably want to share with another human. I mean, look at that tostada.",1
4545,Some friends and I ate dinner here on a Thursday night in October. The weather was great so we asked to be seated outside. The hostess was gracious and helpful despite the rush she was experiencing. There was a single server working the outside and they were patient and helpful. The food was tasty! We ordered a mix of the seasonal specials and a Mexican pizza with chorizo to share. I would recommend this place for a lively night out with friends.,1
4546,"I love this place. There are a few restaurants on the planet that I'd strongly consider getting incredibly fat and dying early for. This is one of them. Okay, perhaps there is a compromise. Perhaps eating once a day and walking 12,000 steps. I dont know. But the food is incredible.",1
4547,"Stopped by for a couple churros, which were great, as well as some food later on. We had the tyaluda which was interesting, it was kind of a mix between a nacho and a pizza.",1
4548,"Rick Bayless restaurant, adds his own spin to Mexican food, good food for the area.",1
4549,"Excellent food and drinks, super nice staff.
My only issue was a noteworthy one. I super clearly let the server know I'm vegan and that good friends who are vegan had been there just a week before and had great vegan food. However, he did not understand. At least twice for certain, and I think even a third time he suggested dishes with dairy. The one I remember specifically was goat milk cheese.
We did *finally* get past that hurdle, but it left me worried about what was going to be on my plate when it arrived.
It turned out to be more than just perfectly fine, it was fantastic!
I am just really shocked that in a major city like Chicago that I would have such an issue with trying to order food vegan, especially when I know good friends had just been there and had reported that they had a great experience.",1
4550,"1) The waitress do not speak English and we had difficulty ordering.
2) The waitress immediately added 20% without permission and asks us she needs 7% more as if she is working in the bar
We felt like we were robbed
We were there 5/11/22 around 7:30 pm sat at the high chairs inside facing the host
Very angry right now",0
4551,"It's easy to miss this place as you walk down Clark St, but believe me, you don't want to miss it. Make the turn onto Illinois St and stop in, especially for breakfast. The food is fantastic and the chocolate is incredible!",1
4552,"So fresh and delicious, the guacamole with all the different toppings is amazing. We will definitely be going back!",1
4553,The food was great and the service was fantastic! I will definitely be back for more tacos and quac!!!,1
4554,This place is my favorite ❤️ every ingredient  is so fresh ! Do try the xoco tortilla soup and chicken tinga taco and churros and the xoco special margarita.,1
4555,Excellent food and service !! Would definitely go again to try more items from the menu !,1
4556,Everything was so tasty and fresh. And the churros did not taste greasy at all.,1
4557,"Delicious food and drinks. Aztec hot chocolate pictured. It's a little confusing for people when you enter. You stand in line for the cashier and the host will ask you if you plan to sit down to eat. If you do, he'll give you a number for the seating position. The cashier will ask for that. After you take your seat, you can order additional drinks and desserts... So don't get back in line or worry about dessert unless you are in a rush. Everything is well prepared, but, it's ""fast food"". If you want a restaurant dining experience, go to Frontera or Topolobampo. I'll usually pick Topolobampo or Xoco depending on my mood and amount of time I want to spend eating.",1
4558,Some unbelievably good Mexican food I recommend they're getting a bit before lunch time as the line can get a bit long,1
4559,Great Aztec hot chocolate.. the tacos were good too,1
4560,Soups were so flavorful. Churros are beautifully done and light. Highly recommend them,1
4561,"So good!!! Amazing food, best churros ever, micheladas, tacos, very good service, highly recomended...",1
4562,"Food took forever to come, took 20 mins to get seated and probably another 20-30 to order/ get food.

Food was interesting but not that great.",1
4563,"Incredible food! If you're wondering where you should go for Mexican, look no further. Guacamole was great. Ahogada tortas and short rib taco's were insanely good! Only regret not taking desert, so don't make the same mistake.",1
4564,Soooo good. Why is my torta in the chili broth?! Because it is awesome! That's why. Maybe too tasty. Food should not be eaten that quickly!,1
4565,"Amazing breakfast.  I had the saturday special: enchiladas.  The portion was huge, i couldn't finish. This restaurant is really well organised for a quick casual meal or takeout.",1
4566,"Bangin! This is in the top three things I tasted while in Chicago. The sandwich was great the guacamole is one if a kind and to die for, and the chocolate covered churro will make you hurt somebody.",1
4567,"Hard to find better quality food for the price in the city. Plus, service was quick and friendly.",1
4568,"Customer for many years . Food it’s outstanding and the Aztec chocolate it’s a must during winter, however I’m done with this place , the host today exactly at 1058 am didn’t even greet me just straight told me can’t take your order until 11am she kick me out with a frigid weather in Chicago , didn’t let me stay inside for 1 min …… when I ask for my chocolate she gave the nastiest look and didn’t want to really take care of my order , as much as I love the food there’s no reason for someone to be so nasty during winter time . I won’t ever be there again.",0
4569,"I have been a big Rick Bayless (the chef) fan for many years and remember watching his shows when he was on PBS.
I have been here before for food and it doesn't disappoint. I consider the food a better Chipotle.
Today we just stopped for delicious hot cocoa-- the one with the chile is Soo good. It sounds weird but isn't, get it!",1
4570,"I liked this place and used to come or order regularly. However, last night experience was very dissapointing. The service was really bad, we had to wait for one of our margaritas for like 40 min even though it was not busy at all. On top of that we were charged one extra margarita. After politely pointing out the mistake, our waitress was very rude and was claiming she brought us all margaritas. Very dissapointing experience. I will not be back any time soon.
By the way, tip of 20% tip is already included in the bill.",0
4571,Ended up getting the goat sandwich. Incredible. The Mrs had something that I equated to a Mexican chicken noodle soup. Also delicious. Getcha' some!,1
4572,"Terrible service, took 45 mins for one sandwich and staggered the order for the rest. 10 mins for water and little waiting in general. Food was between not good and unremarkable.",0
4573,"Xoco used to be my fave mexican restaurant but they now charge mandatory tips for pickup orders, which they never did before the pandemic. The food is good but the price plus tips no longer justify the food quality.",0
4574,Excellent brunch as always,1
4575,"Had a very tasty Cuban sandwich. Customer service could have been a little better--when we ordered at the register, we were not told we would later have to specifically request our churros.",1
4576,"Flavorful, authentic, fast and good prices!
They will charge you 20% tip mandatory… FYI.",1
4577,The chicken Tinga tacos were delicious. I was pleasantly surprised with the food. This will be a go-to for me now!,1
4578,"I always enjoy Rick Bayless tv series, however I was disappointed with his over rated restaurant.
At the end of the meal the waitress read out very quickly the bill, and total.  We heard the words service charge.  No bill was handed to us. Then she returned with her machine for adding the 20% tip. I asked what the earlier 20% tip was that she had included.  Her explanation was the first 20% was for the staff, and the second 20% was for her.   At no time we’re we handed a paper bill, nor did we see it until I had to request to see it through her machine.
If this is there practice then it should be shared with the customers prior to ordering.",0
4579,Food is ok. But customer services lacking. A lot of Covid rules still and the hostess was very rude/pushy on where and how we sat.,1
4580,"My partner, our two small children and I waited for about 30 minutes outside in the cold and it was COMPLETELY WORTH IT.
Our server was very patient with us (as our group included two very tired, very grumpy kiddos), always smiling no matter the punky interjection from our waning, food-averse kids.
My partner and I split the Ahogada and Milanese sandwich, as per our server's suggestion - which, while we ate them, transported us into a dreamlike state of deliciousness, clouding the negatives of our context with the spectacular taste of edible joy. (Hyperbole? You decide. I'm leaning ""nope."")
I had a mango/habanera margarita to join this nomnom experience and, let me tell you: ... I can't put it into words, y'all. It was a pairing I continue dream about.
Oh and the kids flipped their taste buds over the carnitas tacos to boot - a *major* feat (no pun intended). Most parents get how hard it is to find a place that *everyone* can truly enjoy together - this place is a diamond in the rough.
Even the guacamole was outside our realm of current understanding - exploding our avocado horizons, setting a new bar we may never see reached again.
In today's world, things pretty much range from bad to horrid and these moments of comfort are essential - it's pretty much self-care and I'm totally into it.
(Nope, wasn't paid to write this and, yep, the language is ridiculous AF - blame the food. It was that good.)",1
4581,"Churros are overpriced and don't live up to the hype. The sandwiches are worth the price, though.",1
4582,"4.5 / 5 - While visiting Chicago, I came across this restaurant by chance. Got 4 rib tacos for $14 and it was worth every cent. Each taco was overflowing with ingredients; They do NOT hold back. And the sauce that came with it was KILLER. If you like Mexican food, do NOT sleep on this holy s—-!!!!!!",1
4583,"Great flavor, Quick service, Great prices and loved the music. Perfect spot if you are travelling solo or a small party.",1
4584,Mind blowing ingredients and preparation. Returned for breakfast. Divine French Toast and Huevos Rancheros. Mexican frothy chocolate from another world of taste and imagination,1
4585,"Bad,bad and bad... tortilla soup to start was super salty.. come on Rick, you know your chef can do better than this...barbacoa tacos no flavor... Tlayuda we added chorizo on it...and it was like just 5 little pieces ... and still got charged extra 20% service oh wow... our bill was like 100 and something dollars for a food that we didn't enjoy.. they ask us how was everything.. we told them about our experience and nothing....
Another restaurants will deduct that from your bill or give you a discount..
No bueno señor Rick Bayless !!!🤨",0
4586,Food was amazing and Manny took great care of us!,1
4587,"Great food! Chips and salsa were delicious, especially the red salsa that came with the chips. Short rib tacos were fantastic as well. Everything was packed with flavor. Finishing the meal with a churro was a good choice too!",1
4588,The spicy chicken sandwich is a must-try. I would go hours out of my way for this meal (and have). Don't miss it,1
4589,"This place was the best meal of our trip.  Its a small restaurant with full service even though it looks like a walk up and order.  We had the guacamole with housemade chips, spicy chicken churro sandwich, short rib tacos.  OMG, everything was fantastic!!!  Marg’s could be freshly made only thing from giving 5 stars.  Highly recommend!!  Wallet friendly too!",1
4590,It's a must stop!! Short rib tacos are worth the wait.,1
4591,Amazing customer service and great food. I had an extremely flavorful Red Chili Seafood Soup. I would highly recommend. Worth the visit.,1
4592,I ordered the pepito torta & the milanesa chicken torta. Both tortas were grade A certified delicious! Don't forget to grab a churro for dessert.,1
4593,"Rick Bayless creates delicious soup and sandwiches, a great change from tacos but he makes great tacos too. It's all delicious",1
4594,"TLDR: Fantastic quick service Mexican eats with a great happy hour. Strong margs and amazing tortas.

Vibe: 4/5. Limited seating inside and outside (mostly counter style seating) makes this place good for groups less than 4. There are a few 2-4 tops, but are sought after during peak hours. If you taking to go, walk up style ordering is available as soon as you walk in.

Service: 5/5. Staff is prompt to take your order with a very fast turn around in the kitchen. Servers  use handheld POS so getting you check is quick and easy. Currently they are taking an automatic 15% gratuity, but it is heavily advertised.

Food: 5/5. Some of the best quick service food I have ever eaten. The tortas and corn tlayuda are amazing, using only the freshest ingredients and providing an experience well worth the price. Happy hour also has some amazing deals on food and drink making this place even more enticing.",1
4595,This place blows me away every time I'm here. The flavors are out of this world. Pick anything on the menu...can't go wrong.,1
4596,"Guac and horchata were fantastic, but the churros y chocolate is the star of the show.",1
4597,Great eggplant torta. Tlayuda was SO FUN. Definitely solves the problem of that one person taking all the nachos with the toppings. It also answers the question what if nachos were actually a pizza. Also Aztec chocolate drink was excellent.,1
4598,Lots of great items on this menu - especially the the pistachio churros,1
4599,Went here just for some dessert. Their chocolate products are amazing if you like the 'real chocolate' taste. Also their churros were very tasty.,1
4600,"Really enjoyed the food! Always like trying mexican cuisine with a twist. Their Gringa Torta and tortilla soup didn't disappoint. Also tried the Tlayuda, yum! And couldn't leave without tithe churros....recommend the pistachio glazed!",1
4601,"Got cubano and Milanesa tortas/sandwiches. Both pretty good. Personally, I liked the fact that the flavours were very distinct and different from each other. Churros were good, nothing great. Service was good, not great. Waiter was a little pushy on desserts. Also, 15% tip is added to all bills by default.",1
4602,Food was amazing!! I had their carnitas tacos and my mom has the churro chicken sandwich and we both loved them.,1
4603,"Good flavors.  Gets very busy but takeout was reasonably quick.  Word of caution that serving sizes of the tacos are not large, some of us were still hungry after.",1
4604,"Rick Bayless never fails. I have been a fan of his for so many years, watching his shows on PBS. I have admired his passion and excellence for Mexican foods, he is so much into it to the point that sometimes I truly believe he is serenading all these exotic ingredients!😊 today my husband and i went to one of his restaurants Xoco in Chicago, we came from Michigan for 2 days only  ""specifically"" to dine at his place and I can tell you, the quality is excellent, its not only worth  every penny,  but the 5 hours drive from Michigan. To those who appreciate the art of food and the explosions of spices and herbs in your mouth, search no further. We will surely come back again. Our lunch was very memorable and our server Manuel is amazing. Chef Rick happened to be there and Manuel our server created the opportunity to meet him and have a photo with him.",1
4605,Love the food. Service is solid. Wish their soft drinks weren't the little bottles at $2/bottle. The soft drink issue is the only reason it's not 5 stars.,1
4606,Amazing food & drinks; friendly staff. The Aztec Hot Chocolate is a must!!,1
4607,"Ordered to-go orders even if we had a meal at the restaurant nearby already, twice. Very authentic mexican food, and for someone who had a lot of TEXMEX in Texas for many years, we mean it. The tlayuda is absolutely awesome, very thin crust of tostada with black bean paste and cheese plus pork loin. The three chili salsa adds to the flavor. Their taco is also good we had short rib and goat (which is a Saturday special). Highly recommend!",1
4608,"Good vegan torta! Will replace meat with avocado in case you don't want the vegetarian option. Nice outdoor seating. Chips and salsa are great. Churros are labeled vegan on the menu, so I was very excited to have; however, they fry them in same fryer as meat so they are not truly vegan unfortunately so I didn't have them.",1
4609,"I love the chips! Literally the chips and salsa are amazing. I know you're thinking ""they're just chips"" but you are soooo wrong. Best! The Baja Chicken and churros 👍 👍",1
4610,Mexican street food at is best. Great spot for lunch.,1
4611,Incredible place. The food is perfect. The atmosphere and staff ate excellent. You can't go wrong here.,1
4612,Whilst in Chicago for a conference I ate here on three occasions. The food is excellent!,1
4613,First time here and was extremely satisfied. Breakfast was Delish.  If your in the neighborhood I highly recommend coming here. Any breakfast choice you make will be excellent!,1
4614,"First time dining at any of Rick bayless’s restaurants. I was pretty excited to try the food and hot chocolate here! We ordered the fully loaded guacamole, short rib tacos, cubana torta sandwich, three churros with chocolate sauce and a classic hot chocolate!
Food was all really good, the standout was the cubana sandwich made in a wood fire oven a Smokey slightly roasted flavor and aroma was kissed on This sandwich by the fire gods! The bread was crispy on the outside and fluffy and tender on the inside (crispy but thin, not to cut the roof of my mouth crispy) really a well constructed and delicious sandwich.
Some of the lower points the hot chocolate was good, but didn’t blow my mind.... I guess I was expecting a little more than I should have on a richness and creaminess level of the drink.
Also I totally approve of living wages for the staff of any hospitality establishments or restaurants! However the 15% service charge with option to tip more is a great idea in theory. But unfortunately for my wife and I it seemed as the friendly and caring nature of out server went straight out the window... she came at the beginning of the meal took our order and was never to be seen again until the check, didn’t ask if our food came out correctly (we asked for cheese on the side for everything and the guacamole came with cheese), didn’t have a chance to ask for more napkins, even though they bring a carafe of water for the table, my wife and I finished it and were wanting more.
All in all I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and everyone in search of tasty delicious food, the less that excellent service comments are to maybe lower you expectations if you plan to dine here but more so hopefully the chef, owner, or manager to hear and hopefully correct and train the server we had better!",1
4615,Food was delicious. We like everything ordered here.,1
4616,I wasn’t really a fan of the food. I had a torta and the chocolate churro. The torta itself was not really tasty and the churro was small in size and over chocolaty. You can seriously get this food better tasting and a fraction of the price at your local mom & pop Mexican business that have authentic flavors.,0
4617,"This is the third time I've been here. The last two times, I experienced poor service. I let it go the first time. When I arrived, I stood in the entryway looking at the menu; no one said anything (several people were standing around). I walk up to the counter; after about 30 seconds, someone asks if I want to dine in/out. First, I say, dine in but change my mind. They then call someone else to assist me and direct me back to the entryway where my order is taken, and I pay. I'm told I have to wait outside, and my order will be brought out to me. I'm waiting about 10 minutes, and I see a man that arrived about 5 minutes after I put in my order to come pick up his order. Then another person comes in and picks up an order (they appear to have two occupied tables dining in the restaurant.) I walk in to find out what's going on, and they look at me like they never saw me before. I give them my name, and it turns out my food is ready, waiting for me to pick it up. 🤦🏾‍♀️ I ordered a Cubana with no black beans, very salty.",0
4618,"The food here is no doubt very good and flavorful. But the host is extremely rude and unhelpful, and the service is disorganized. It was clear we paid for the food only and not the service. I’d recommend doing takeout and not dine in because it was not enjoyable to dine in. The inside was loud, not very nice or welcoming, and we literally sat facing a wall.",1
4619,"My wife and I dined here for lunch and we both agreed that his was one of the best meals we have ever had. We ordered the Milanesa Torta ,  the Chicken Tinga Tacos, and the Shortrib Tlayuda and they all absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and I keep trying to go back there while my wife is insisting on trying new places since we are only in Chicago for two weeks. 😄 It is also very reasonably priced for the location.",1
4620,Awesome chicken tinga tacos and barbacoa torta! 🌮,1
4621,"Great food, HORRIBLE SERVICE. Spicy and server never comes back. Manager RUDE and hostess too. Seated facing a wall just inches from our face as we (3 of us) were side by side and it was too loud to have a conversation. Very disappointed in this place!",0
4622,Great modern Mexican food. Non-spicy and vegetarian options available. It can get very crowded and the place is small so plan ahead. Most staff members are bilingual 🙌🏼,1
4623,Delicious! Server suggested the chicken sandwich for lunch and it was excellent. Open kitchen was cool and atmosphere was lively for a Thursday afternoon.,1
4624,"My family of 4 visited here last Friday night and had a GREAT experience! The food was OUTSTANDING. I had the ahogado torta and absolutely loved it. While ordering, they let me know that it was a little spicy and asked if I would like the heat removed (to which I said yes because I'm wimpy when it comes to heat!).  I really appreciated that. It was much better than finding out too late. My 12-year old daughter got the shrimp torta and said it was ""the best thing I've ever eaten!""

We got the churros for dessert and they were very good, a little underdone (IMO), but I like them that way! I find most churros to be way too dry! The chocolate sauce was a little to bitter for my kids, but they pretty much only like milk chocolate. Yay, more for me!

The service was excellent! Prompt and very friendly! We will definitely return!",1
4625,"Multiple points:

Food is okay, service is meh

Seating is tight and faced wall

Online menu price didn't match in-person price

Refused to split 3 items amongst 2 people

Mandatory 20% gratuity no matter how they treated you

Tax is calculated including the mandatory 20% gratuity

$15 item => $26 somehow

Final verdict: avoid if possible

I'm never coming back here ever",0
4626,"This was my first time to Xoco. I’d been to Frontera before and was impressed. I wanted a more relaxed environment, so I tried Xoco. I wasn’t disappointed. I got the Pepita and it was amazing. My only hold from 5-stars was the fact that I paid $7 for a beer. A Pacifico, at that.",1
4627,"Great service with a small but well-executed menu. Everything our 4-person group tried was delicious, esp the tortas.",1
4628,Great margaritas band tlayudas the size of a small car!,1
4629,My Cubana sandwich was SOOOOOOO good!,1
4630,"Amazing, delicious food. Everyone was kind, specially Evelyn. Highly recommended.",1
4631,Delicious! A favorite spot to grab a quick meal when we are in town.  We make sure to grab a drinking chocolate for the road too!,1
4632,A+ for this place! Vibrant decor and music played out for a fun delicious meal! Went for a snack then came back for breakfast the next day!,1
4633,Great acidic salsa I like. The beef tongue tasted good and was tender. The eggplant sandwich is something I can imagine grabbing when I'm too lazy to cook.,1
4634,"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch on a Friday. We really liked the set up of how they took orders (counter service), but still had a process to ensure patrons were seated. It was efficient! We split an appetizer and tacos. I’m from California so a bit particular about Mexican food. I would say the tacos were solid, but not great. One thing I would change is how all taco orders come in fours. I would rather them be in twos so you can mix and match if you would like, and four is a bit much for lunch. I haven’t been here for dinner, but would recommend it be added to the work lunch rotation if you work nearby.",1
4635,"The food is really good and the service too
I came back to this restaurant several times!!
I love the guacamole “fully”
Also the tortilla soup, pozole and tacos de carnitas si the best
And the churros is a perfect choose for dessert!!

In case you are feeling in the mood of margaritas ask for the one of the day, I have tried for the pepino one and Jamaica",1
4636,"Food was excellent! However, service was not very good. No one bothered checking in on us after the food was brought and I had to get up and ask for my check. Hoping not all Rick Bayless restaurants are not like this.",1
4637,Went there once and the service was great and the food was good. Im pretty picky when it comes to eating so I'm usually impressed when a place has good food and this was one of them. Check this place out when you get a change and are in the city. There is a reason it has so many reviews.,1
4638,"What a great place!!!  The fierce smell of melted chocolate hits you a block away, and the renowned churros and drinking chocolate are certainly worth the calories.  But the food is complex and original - and the vegetarian tacos were really good.  The portions are not particularly big, enough for me, but my teenage son was not quite satisfied, and finished my last taco.  It is very casual, small seating area and it gets very busy pretty quickly.  Definitely going back - so many options on the menu I want to try!!",1
4639,The tlayuda is just amazing!!!! Must try place.,1
4640,"Killer margaritas (especially the flavor of the day with pineapple and chili salt), delicious tacos and milanesa, and amazing churros. Think it will be a neighborhood staple for us!",1
4641,"Xoco is one of my favorite places to go. The food is always outstanding. The Torta Ahogada is amazing. Definitely a unique sandwich you can’t get anywhere else. I’ve also had the tacos and pozole which were also fantastic! Another great item is there guacamole! Always fresh and you can pick what you want in it. If you can make it through all that great food there churros are the best!! Made to order and always fresh. They have excellent house made hot chocolate made with chocolate beans. It’s different, much thicker and sweeter.  Overall it’s a great place, little expensive. My only problem is the size of the restaurant. Very small, loud,  and hard to get a table. Wish they had a bigger location.",1
4642,"I've been going here for years and this is still hands-down one of the best places to get a fantastic authentic mexican lunch in all of Chicago. Their soups in particular are bursting with flavor and atypical of what you'll find at most restaurants. Ingredients are always fresh here, and spices are perfectly balanced in a way that most places fail miserably at.",1
4643,"I had been wanting to go to Xoco for a while and finally had the opportunity on a recent trip to Chicago. It definitely lived up to my lofty expectations. Every aspect of our meal (chips and guac, sandwich, margarita, and churros for dessert) was amazing. I would definitely recommend Xoco for lunch for anyone in the area.",1
4644,My goodness this is the best sandwich I’ve ever had in my life,1
4645,"So disappointed of this place…. It used to be a great “Mexican Street food” the tortas were delicious… now basically you pay $15.00 for a bread with salsa and “maybe” some meat.
Don’t waste your money here…",0
4646,Churro spicy chicken burger was amazing! This is how a quick food experience should be. Had to have a second one before I left.,1
4647,"We came here for dessert. Got the Mexico City Thick and it was thick. Lots of spices, and a funny texture. Definitely not your average hot cocoa. The churro was very good. I liked how crunch and soft it was. The after taste got a mild sweet and smooth flavor. I like it a lot. Would love to come back and try the food here!",1
4648,We found this place after a horrible experience down the street at barrio. The food was way cheaper and the service was amazing. We had a one year old with us and they were very accommodating. They searched all over for a high chair and got us 1 as we sat down. We then needed to feed our daughter an avocado and they brought us a very fresh sliced 1 for her to eat.  We will definitely go back next time we are in Chicago and I highly recommend,1
4649,"During these covid times lots of things are uncertain and disappointing. This stop in here was far from that. The quality of food, service and hospitality are far from disappointing. This place is awesome! The spicy churro chicken sandwich is the truth!!! A perfect combination of sweet and savory. Miguel was my server and had amazing suggestions and made sure I was comfortable and taken care of. Will definitely be back. Bayless doesn't ever let you down",1
4650,"OMG!! Hands down one of the best Mexican restaurants i have ever eaten from. Everything I tried was delicious, the short ribs tacos, pozole soup, and almost naked guacamole! Give this restaurant a try and sidenote the servers work as a team therefore, we didn't lack anything!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",1
4651,Really good tacos and great hot chocolate,1
4652,"Extremely poor customer service. Hostess was extremely rude, gave attitude when we asked to change seats because parts of the restaurant smelled like sewage. Took the waiter 10 minutes just to bring water, and wait for food was extremely long despite dining at off peak hours when place was near empty. Overall this place is overrated, overpriced, and has terrible customer service. Save your energy and go elsewhere!",0
4653,"Brought my sister here for her birthday, and apart from the slightly confusing seating arrangements (you wait in line until a place is ready and then order) the food was amazing! I wish they had one of these everywhere. Food is locally sourced and freshly prepared, I had the short rib tacos which were 4 for $12, and they were fantastic! Drinks were good, only two options. A paloma and a margarita, but both were delicious! No beer for us, but some Mexican specialties were available.",1
4654,"Service was horrible from the start. Hostess was rude and our server took our order and then never came back. We eventually, hunted down the manager, so we could get our bill and she was also pretty rude.  The food was ok and not worth the poor service.  Definitely, recommend going elsewhere.",0
4655,"Extremely disappointed. Been here in the past and the food is usually great, but the service was terrible. Our waitress lingered at the table as if she wasn't sure how to do her job. I understand there was a language barrier but, she seemed unsure of how to be a waitress. Furthermore, she couldn't give accurate descriptions of the food on her own account. She would read the menu right back to you, or try to read it best as she could. They then brought out the wrong food order and instead of fixing it, insisted this is what we ordered when in fact we did not. After continued debate, we took the food as to not have to be dealing with the staff who insisted we did but were not the staff who took the order. Finally, they were insistent on telling us a 15% gratuity was added to our check, but that we could add more to the tip. For one, most parties of 8 or more people, gratuity is already added. It was just 2 of us. So you added the tip on your own, but you want more of a tip??? To continually point that out suggests to me you arent making enough money and are demanding more by way of pointing that out more than once. Its unprofessional and rude. The enforced gratuity seems unnecessary. Let people decide based on their service how they want to tip, not because you claim it is a company policy. Overall, was unhappy with the experience, food quality aside.",0
4656,I was really craving some good Mexican food but this place was subpar. The churros were great and all but I resorted to a salad because I craved a burrito or classic tacos but none to be found on the menu.,0
4657,"The tacos that I got were really dry and the meat tasted days old. The chips even tasted stale, my drink was really good though. Walk a block down for some really good tacos and chips. I won’t visit again.",1
4658,"Classis margarita with float was yummy!  Short rib tacos were fantastic, braised beef sandwich was outstanding!  Really nice outdoor seating.  Appreciate safety measures in place.",1
4659,Always flavorful. Love their woodland mushroom sandwich!,1
4660,"Went here for lunch and there wasn’t a very long wait to order your food. After ordering, you were sat down at you table if you were eating in and they would bring you your food when it was ready. I got the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was great! I also ordered the churro cheesecake and it was phenomenal. The churro was warm and soft and the cheesecake was smooth and rich in flavor. If you have time to go here, I highly recommend it.",1
4661,"Despite a pretty hefty line, service was quick. Staff is good about explaining how the ordering/seating works. Got us a nice spot outside on the sidewalk (as requested). The special goat torta my wife and I split was fantastic. The guacamole bar offers a lot of options for mix-ins. And I tried one of the chocolate drinks, but that wasn't really my thing/don't think I'd order it again. Nice place for some ""street food"" type items, though.",1
4662,"Ok- I understand that this is a highly rated place. However, as a vegetarian , I was hoping to enjoy some classic Mexican taste for lunch and it came up short.
The veggie options were limited and my tacos were basic black beans with fresh onion and cilantro. Nothing tasty that I couldn’t have prepared at home.
BUT- My carnivore companion absolutely raved about his food.
Everything was very fresh. The lemon aid was fantastic. Horchata was unique.
Seating is tricky and uncomfortable if they put you at the bar that faces a big wall.
I’d like to see more authentic options/tastes for none meat eaters. 🙂",1
4663,"Great lively place with good sandwiches, the soups are good too! The Mexican chocolate & coffee drinks are also worth a try. It's a very busy place and seating is limited so you might end up waiting for a place to sit for a long time on the weekends.",1
4664,Tamarind Pork torta and pozole were excellent! Service was fast even at lunch rush.  Thanks!,1
4665,"I completely had fun at this dining establishment, the food is amazing, and the bathrooms were clean. It was a little cool inside, so that was not the best. The atmosphere is great. I will most definitely think about returning again if I have the opportunity. Me and also my good friend ordered the salad and also we were not disappointed. My one pointer is to keep the cold exterior. Come again!",1
4666,"I love this place and would go often for authentic quick Mexican food. I recently went to place an order for takeout. They added a $5 tip onto my bill without my knowledge. My total bill was only $14. I have never experienced a restaurant that thought their clients were stupid enough to notice added tips. Because of this dishonest behavior of their staff, I will never go back.",0
4667,"Sorry, the menu looked great so did a togo just now in NYE 2021. But feels like the last meal of 2020 had to be horrible just like the year. We ordered a baja chicken sandwich, a Milanesa sandwich and a veggie taco. The Milanesa sandwich was somewhat okay. It was dry so I had to gulp it down with help of water. The baja chicken had no chicken and instead it had pork and was too smelly. My boyfriend couldn’t eat. The sour cream ot blue cheese (whatever) in the tacos was too sour. My boyfriend took a bite and was done. I just gulped down the taco and threw away the remaining three. Worst decision of our lives to eat from this place. Eeww ! This will count as one of the horrible food experiences. HNY",0
4668,"Unable to get seating with COVID-19 restrictions in place.  However,  it was a cold and rainy day... perfect for taking some chicken tortilla soup home.  Three orders to go were ready without too much of a wait and were wonderful! Made reservations for Frontera Grill (they were booked two weeks out) for next time.  Rick Bayliss is a God in the chef world and with his three restaurants on North Clark (XOCO, Frontera Grill, and Topolobampo), you can't go wrong!",1
4669,"What happened to Bayless restaurants. Has he given up and prefers to spend more time at his garden. Tried all 3 restaurants (bar sotano, frontera and xoco) this summer as they were surprisingly the easiest to get into and now I know why. I’ve lived in Chicago for 20 years and his restaurants were local favorites now they are total tourist traps. I literally had to spit out the ceviche at frontera the fish was so bad, the chicken at xoco had cartilage in it, and what happened to the flavors I used to remember. People, please keep in mind these known chefs rarely spend time at their restaurants anymore and the quality now shows!",1
4670,"You know, my friend wrote a review of our visit to Xoco the other day. The two of us work in a restaurant, her and myself both in FOH shift leader and BOH kitchen manager positions. I brought my friend along hoping to impress her with the food. Unfortunately we left hungry and 10 dollars poorer.

We placed our order for some chips and dip to get started and then placed our order for our main dish with one server. About forty minutes go by and we needed to leave to make it to our own job and had to grab the attention of another server since our original waitress couldn’t be found. When we asked to have our order to go rather than brought to the table the waitress informed us that our original server didn’t put in our order and left.

As a server I get it. Things happen. I’m more disappointed in how the situation was handled after we were informed. I asked for the bill and saw that I had to pay 10 dollars for some chips, and then had a 15% service charge attached to the bill. As someone who works in a restaurant I think everyone deserves fair pay, but your staff needs to really deliver if you’re going to automatically place that on the bill.  If the service wasn’t there for 40 minutes while the entire staff saw us, being the only table in the restaurant at the time, and no one thought to inquire, then is that really fair to assume you deserve 15%?

I think the staff needs a little fine tuning when it comes to organization, communication, and intuitively knowing how to properly solve issues with your tables. It looks like management doesn’t respond to reviews here, but I’d love to hear back.",0
4671,"Staying late at work, I got two pepitos for me and my boss. The sandwiches were tasty, meat very tender and the mix of flavors was great. The sandwich was a bit pricey compared to the portion size but overall a good experience.",1
4672,"Get tacos, churros, and know you're lucky.",1
4673,"It was such a bad experience that it took me a couple of days to come up with a review for this place. The wait to begin with was around an hour and it seemed that it was only us waiting to come in. Anyway downtown, Saturday night it’s something you may expect for a place with no reservations option. Hostess was rude, very rude. Didn’t feel welcomed at all, we didn’t leave because we were guests of an other couple who were exited to invite us there ( pretty sure they regretted ). We were invited in but unable to order because we officially didn’t have a table, waiter came by we ordered drinks which they have not a big selection. We were offered appetizers but turned out to be not possible since we were still waiting for a table. 10 min later we were finally seated didn’t get time to look at the menu when they told us we had to hurry up because kitchen was about to close . With such a disappointment we ordered our food nothing special about it to be mention,or probably the fact that their tortas ahogadas lack of their most important ingredient the spicy sauce. Might be that we are not the intended customer I don’t know. Anything good that the meals could have were ruined by the staff urgency to close opening doors from both sides to let us know we had to go. Trying to pick up our plates and drinks before we were done. Very disrespectful. My husband and I used to go to the other location never had a complaint. I don’t know how else to express the feelings towards this restaurant. Truly disappointed.",0
4674,"The food was very good.  However, one of our sandwiches came out looking very plain, and I thought maybe it was someone else's order.  The server insisted that it was the one we had ordered, the Saturday social.  I showed him all the toppings that were listed on the menu for that sandwich, and he grudgingly took it away.  He came back a few minutes later having thrown on some avocado pieces and said something like, ""Now it has avocados on it.""

I can't blame the restaurant for this next thing, but people walking by the outdoor seating on the sidewalk kept trying to eat our chips.",1
4675,The food was jst ok ! We went as a group ! I tried 10+ types of food their ! Below average!,1
4676,"Went here for lunch and there wasn’t a very long wait to order your food. After ordering, you were sat down at you table if you were eating in and they would bring you your food when it was ready. I got the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was great! I also ordered the churro cheesecake and it was phenomenal. The churro was warm and soft and the cheesecake was smooth and rich in flavor. If you have time to go here, I highly recommend it.",1
4677,"Been here a number of times, always get some variant of their hot chocolate and usually a sweet. From churros to their pumpkin ginger tres leches cake, I've never been disappointed. Small space and small kitchen, be patient on busy days it's worth it.",1
4678,This is an amazing place that appreciates return visitors. The first night I had the Cabana Torta. The ham and bacon were both thick slices with a little bit of char for flavor. The second night was Baja chicken Torta. That too was amazing with lighter flavors. I've had the almost naked and the full dressed guacamole. I prefer the almost naked with a couple adds. The fully dressed is a bit busy for my taste.,1
4679,This is literally one of our favorite restaurants in the world!! Always good food and service! Good vegan options. Anytime we go to Chicago this is a must!,1
4680,Delicious and casual but the food felt very upscale,1
4681,"Unique guacamole, was pretty tasty w the bacon. Nothing SPECTACULAR about their tacos, but pretty good for the type of restaurant it is. Drinks left something to be desired. Just okay. If you go here, definitely get the hot chocolate w the whole milk (CLASSIC) - SO GOOD.",1
4682,"I had been looking for a good, authentic Mexican restaurant for a while but never found one that I was satisfied with. I heard about Xoco from a friend and decided to try it out. I like how it has a casual dine-in atmosphere, which I feel like made it seem more cozy. We ordered a Pepito and short rib tacos. The tacos were really juicy and had the perfect hint of savor from lime and añejo cheese. The Pepito sandwich was absolutely amazing! I savored it with every bite I took. The bread was baked to give it the perfect amount of crunch, along with the melted cheese and the tender meat. I regret sharing with my husband because I wanted more when I was done with my half! I definitely will be going back soon",1
4683,"Reasonably priced, well portioned, and delicious. My girlfriend had the beef tacos, I had the cochinita pibil sandwich - both were A+. The accompanying salsa was perfectly spicy as promised. Margaritas were small but deceptively strong - probably wouldn't have gotten them if not for the happy hour price though. Will definitely return!",1
4684,"Amazing tacos… the hot sauce with the short rib  tacos is to die for, and the prices are phenomenal for what you get! The almost naked chips are delicious as well.",1
4685,Confused why people thought that this was good. The tortilla soup was just an oil slick of 5 little bits of chicken and no flavor. This place survives off of the name recognition.,0
4686,"Worst service I have experienced in a long time. After we were sat we waited for 20 minutes for our server. She came by and told us ""sorry for the wait they were on a shift change"". We put our food and drink order in, and we got out tortas which were delicious, but our margaritas never showed up. Finally asked the hostess and our margaritas showed up 3/4 through the meal and 45 minutes into lunch. There were 3 tables outside that were sat. If you want to get food from here save yourself the anger and order it to go. They automatically added a 15% tip on the bill which might explain the service.",0
4687,"We have loved the food here since they opened. One of the places we miss most since moving to the burbs. Food is delicious, both the regular and seasonal offerings. Our favorite is the Ahogada sandwich. Be prepared for authentic, tasty, spicy food and potential long waits especially in the summer.",1
4688,"It's decent Mexican food. I didn't find anything particularly amazing, though ti was all fine.

The seasonal salad at the time was octopus salad. They were heavy handed with the dressing, which made it very sour.

The short rib tacos are good too. Overall, was not too impressed.",1
4689,"We tried the Champurrado hot chocolate and a churro.

Hot chocolate was good. Quite different from what I've had elsewhere. The churros tasted great but the dulce de leche dip was a let down. It was quite watery and didn't have much flavor.",1
4690,"Lively atmosphere.  I wanted to dance in line!

The Pork Belly sandwich was quite tasty with a whole lotta flavors going on at once.  The hot juices running out of the pork when you bit into was a great sign!  The zucchini gave the sandwich some unexpected, but welcomed texture, and the bread/bun was toasted very crispy.

I also had the Bean-To-Cup Aztec hot chocolate.  At first the small cup put me off, but then I discovered how rich and thick it was.  Truly the most unique and delicious hot chocolate I've ever had.  I wish it had been served a bit warmer though so it would have stayed hot longer.

I highly recommend, and it is definitely a place I would come back to which is good and bad... I like to try new spots when I'm visiting a new town, but call me a ""regular"" here now.",1
4691,"Amazing food and flavor, almost like you were in Mexico, try the pozole!",1
4692,"The best tortilla soup you will ever eat; great sandwiches, nice staff and sustainability. Waiting for carryout was really easy with parking on a Saturday afternoon.",1
4693,"OMG this place is AH-MAZZZZIIIIING (in my Oprah voice).  First let me start by recognizing that the staff here is wonderful and very helpful.  I was unsure of what to order and I asked one of the staff who recommended the Milanesa Torta. Now upon reading the ingredients I was somewhat hesitant but figured I would go with it because the staff highly recommended it.  We got to our table and my supervisor and coworker started of with the loaded guacamole which was sooooo good, but had a ton of ingredients in it which mixed sooooo well together.  They also ordered the Chicken in mole torta and the Tlayuda Al Postor.  Now that Al Pastor is huge almost the size of a medium pizza but it is very light and thin yet soooo packed with flavor.  The pineapple is seasoned to perfection and offers a great mix of flavors combined with the pork loin, cheese and salsa.  My coworker said that her torta was also sooo good that it did not need any additional seasoning and was a wonderful mix of flavors as well.  But that Milanesa torta, which is a fancy chicken sandwich was sooooooooooo good that I was very impressed.  I am a huge fan of seasoning (if you cant already tell) and this sandwich gave my taste buds so much joy.  Last we had a churro with chocolate and peanuts that I swear God himself dipped his hand in and blessed the chocolate because that chocolate is divine. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return.",1
4694,The place has a good vibe. The prices are on the higher than average but the quality of the ingredients justifies it. The goat barbacoa torta is pretty good. The guacamole is chunky and very tasty. The only negative is that all the food was too salty for me. My dining partner on the other hand thought the salt was perfect.,1
4695,Food was delish. I had the avocado toast with shrimp.,1
4696,"loved this place for breakfast.

excellent all around: great food, super friendly and helpful staff.

love love love.",1
4697,Delicious tacos and churros. Soft serve ice cream was amazing.,1
4698,"Stopped here for a quick lunch while visiting Chicago. We had fancy dinner reservations in the evening but we kept coming back to how fantastic our meal was at Xoco. Everything we ordered had amazing flavor that felt very soulful in execution. Though it was very busy, it was filled with great energy and all staff we interacted with emitted positivity. We ended up trying almost everything on the menu because we couldn’t have enough! This was the highlight of our trip! We will be making this a regular stop any time we are in the area again.",1
4699,Amazing flavors. Everything we tried was simply delicious 😋,1
4700,"Good food, but this location can get a little crowded. It's very narrow and the line often snakes at the doorway, which means it's hard to get in/out when there's a long line. If you can avoid the lunch crowd (11:15-1), it doesn't take a terribly long time, but if you hit at prime lunch time, you'll be waiting. There is limited seating at this restaurant, and it's more fast casual, as you don't have wait staff to order, but they do bring out your food. They do have some patio seats.",1
4701,"A gem. For 20% more than fast casual chain food you can have a culinary experience that you'll be reflecting on fir the rest of the day. Used to be this place was too crowded to reliably have a work day lunch, not anymore. It's still usually busy but there's no wait. Highly recommend!!!!",1
4702,The young lady behind the counter was helpful and friendly. She was patient while we pondered over our decision. The tacos were delicious. The juice that was recommended to us was ice cold and refreshing. Would definitely recommend.😋😋😀😁😄😛,1
4703,"First Time trying the Cubana Torta and it was amazing! Nothing was too salty the meat wasn't dry and the green sauce that's come with it, packs a lot of flavor and a little kick. Will definitely be coming back!",1
4704,"Great food! This was my first time having breakfast here and it was as delicious as every other time I've been here. When you're in Chicago, try to go! The line is often out the door, so plan ahead. Outdoor seating is available as well. Can't wait to go again.",1
4705,I haven't been in 8 years but is still hands down one of the best sandwiches I've had...,1
4706,"Sometimes bland, always expensive.

I've had the tacos multiple times and have been disappointed in the overly squeaky tortillas used.

If you come early enough in the evening, keep an eye out for the limited Happy Hour Menu. It gives you a taste of the food while saving quite a bit of money.",1
4707,Insanely good food. Can't recommend enough!,1
4708,"Such a great spot if you work in River North and you're looking for a great lunch. The sandwiches are amazing and have the most flavor I have every tasted in one. They are very quick during the lunch hour, and make sure you know all of your choices. The service is very good. The only downside is that I rarely get to eat there during the lunch hour because of the limited amount of seating.",1
4709,"The food was very good. The short rib tacos were delicious. My wife loved the pozole and the chiccharones were terrific. The hazelnut churro was  tasty, but a bit pricy. The agua fresca limonade was very refreshing. The music was pretty loud, so it was hard to carry on a conversation without yelling.",1
4710,Their takeout is efficient and fast! The host was friendly and inviting. But the food was amazing! The Cubano was excellent and the tinga tacos are incredible!,1
4711,Industry leaders for a reason,1
4712,"Great food and you can tell from a mile away because the place is usually packed, which is the only downside. They have a wide variety of traditional Mexican food with unique twists. Highly recommend if passing by.",1
4713,"The place was packed, hard to have conversations, and the entree was just ok (chicken tinga tacos - tortillas handmade and very thick, filling just ok).  The guac appetizer was delicious though! Also, it was confusing trying to figure out if the hostess was the waitress. We started out by getting into a line to order, then while ordering, the staff said we were high top 77. We thought it was open seating until that point.  We got our receipt, sat at our table, and couldn't tell if there was wait staff or not.  Had to get back up to ask for waters. Also, after eating had to get up to ask staff for a to go box. Overall, food 4/5, service 2/5, and environment 3/5.",1
4714,"Short rib tacos were so flavorful and the portions are generous. The short ribs are so tender i still want more!
The churros were pretty sweet, so much so that when i drank my iced mint tasted bitter lol.
I recommend trying the all dressed guac as well if you have the appetite",1
4715,"I finally stopped in to XOCO today and dined in. I ordered the cubana torta, and three churros with the chocolate dipping sauce as an after meal. The staff was incredibly nice and I felt welcome to a place I've been meaning to see since Action Bronson show (half cheap plug). The cubana arrived in 5 to 8 minutes, and it was gorgeous execution. Sliced in two, crispy but plentiful. With each bite, the sandwich held form, the sauce didn't taste overwhelming or have a strange texture touch wise, but it can get messy good thing for napkins. The bacon was flavorful and it was basically like taking a BLT times 33. Their was hot sauce on the side as well that gave a generous kick to the meal. I was now prepared to start the churros, which they cook fresh so alert staff when you're ready to have them. Again, another 5 minutes, but I didn't mind since staff was decent to me so far. Only downside on the nitpicky side, is wishing I had a better place to sit instead of facing the wall, so I don't feel closed off and blind to my surroundings, but maybe those kind of seats were already taken, but I digress. So, the churros arrive and the first bite of my crystallized delight dipped in cajeta gave me that famous feeling of home Only a select few Mexican dishes can invoke. Crispy but precious and soft. I can't say enough about my experience here, which won't be my last but I recommend to get the full context of this feeling, stop in sometime and you'll understand how. Peace.",1
4716,"This establishment is very casual. You order at the counter and find a seat.  I did not order any entrees, but I did offer dessert.  The churros with chocolate dip were good, but a bit too sweet for me. I did end up finishing it quickly so I would say it's a good snack, but I think there are better options elsewhere for dessert.",1
4717,"Great tacos, authentic ingredients. Seafood soup was also yummy! Habenero sauce was legit 🔥",1
4718,Great food just need to turn the music down a tag. Highly recommend.,1
4719,"Although it is a little confusing how to order and where to sit in this small, corner restaurant, it is entirely worth it! The food is fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the soups and the loaded guacamole. But, you really can't go wrong with anything. Rick Bayless (founder of Frontera Grill next door) is a genius and his dishes are so very good.",1
4720,"What a great spot.  Maria helped my wife and I navigate our allergies (hint: no soy in their products, almost no dairy in anything either), and they were super warm and helpful in working through the menu.  The food was great and the sweet/chocolate churro at the end was great too.",1
4721,"The food was decent and the churros were excellent. My only complaint is that two people received and finished their food before the third meal, which was soup, came out.  The third person was done eating before the last meal, also soup, was delivered to us. We asked the server twice to tell us what was going on, but received no explanation. The manager apologized after we complained.",1
4722,Definitely have to go for the churros at the very least. Everything looked absolutely delicious! I went for lunch with a friend and I got the short rib tacos. They were tasty and plentiful. Little pricy but it's river north so that's normal. The normal churros were warm and almost melted in your mouth. I got the chocolate dipping sauce but it wasnt your typical chocolate. Little more bitter with almost a mocha taste. Worked perfectly with the churros!,1
4723,"We had a frustrating experience. My son ordered shrimp cocktail and the woman said are you sure you only want that? And he confirmed yes. We notice 3 times she forgot our other child’s order, but we caught that one. So we all get our food and no shrimp. So we ask, it was never ordered so the woman comes out to get our credit card and we ask for our desserts at that time, she says yes, no problem. So shrimp comes out but no dessert. We ask again, she never put the order in. So we wait even longer. Then my husband says to the host. We have been waiting for an hour and 15 minutes for dessert and finally it arrives. Food was good but service was not having a good night.",0
4724,This place by Rick Bayless  is phenomenal.  The churro chicken sandwich is to die for. Omg no cap on foenem,1
4725,"I'm only dropping them to 4/5 because they forgot my drink order. The ordering process is also a bit complicated for no reason. Otherwise, this is a great stop with reasonable prices. Wide selection on the menu, including breakfast Tortas until 11am! I'll definitely be back 👍🏾.",1
4726,"Food was great..but our server was inattentive,  we ordered a app of chips & salsa, never got it and before we knew it our main course was arriving.   She never checked on us mid dinning services,  just saw her at the end with the check😔 but over all food great",1
4727,"It's hard to imagine a more consistently excellent fast/casual restaurant.  Most items are in house made, and if not, it is sourced from the nearby vendors with similar standards.  Bread is from bakery standout La Fournette with specific spices for the correct Mexican flavor.

It was happy hour, so I had to try the $5 margarita, and it was perfection on a sunny summer day.  I'm picky about tequila, and margaritas (most are too weak and too sweet).  Made with Libélula tequila, and Combier d’Orange, it was excellent, and a good deal.

For dinner there was a 30th anniversary Torta - braised creekstone shortrib, Oaxacan black mole (Chilhuacle chiles & 28 other ingredients), seared Hudson Valley foie gras, maitake mushrooms, añejo cheese.

I have never had a torta or any sandwich that was this good.  Excellent food reasonable prices, why go anywhere else for mexican food!",1
4728,"Would give it more than 5 stars.  It's been a few weeks since my experience and I can still taste the almost ethereal flavor of the tortas, tacos, churros, and freshly-ground hot chocolate my son and I enjoyed.  Also intercepted Rick Bayless in the back alley, lol.  If you visit Chicago, don't miss this priceless gem!",1
4729,"If I could give Xoco more than five stars, I'd give all the stars! It is possibly my favorite restaurant anywhere. Incredible food and wonderful staff. I go to Xoco every time I'm in Chicago and I never tire of it.",1
4730,Our favorite place to take visitors and our favorite place when we're craving delicious authentic Mexican (healthy) food. Space is tight so don't go if you have more than 4 people. You will have to share tables if it's just 1 or 2 people. The food is absolutely worth standing in line for and you know Rick Bayless is a good employer because his employees are happy people!,1
4731,"If in the mood for a high quality torta, this is the place. I love love love the torta ahogada. The bread is crunchy and the pork juicy. The sauce that it is dipped in can be customized to different levels of spiciness. I have tried the pozole as well. It can be a bit on the salty side. You can customize the guacamole with different ingredients. I love this place!",1
4732,"Visiting from out of town, and was very skeptical of trying Mexican food here. But this place.... SO good! Must try if you’re ever in the area. Everything was so flavorful, and actually spicy!!
Can’t wait to come back to Chicago and come here again!",1
4733,Amazing Chicken Tinga Tacos. I've never eaten such soft chicken in a taco. Loved it. Churro Sundae wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Not worth the hype and don't like the weird taste of sweet potatoes. Chocolate syrup that comes with the churro is a no no for me as well. Not finely done and the granular texture is something that I didn't like.,1
4734,"The main meal was excellent, as was the dessert.  I've never had fresh ground chocolate before.   You must try the chocolate drinks.  The soup I had was very spicy, so be warned if you're stomach can't handle spicy food.  I will definately go back to this place.",1
4735,"This is a treasure that my brother took us to. After the appetizers, we really didn't have room for dinner but we somehow managed not only the most amazing sandwiches, but dessert with churros and REAL hot chocolate, not to be confused with hot cocoa. This is made from scratch chocolate, starting with the owner/chef roasting his own cocoa beans. A must try!",1
4736,"Absolutely fantastic. Went on an early Saturday morning just after they opened while the place was still empty and the guy working the counter was friendly when we had no idea what we wanted. Ended up getting the chicken chilaquiles and my wife got the pork belly chilaquiles, both were fabulous. Also got the traditional hot chocolate which was great.",1
4737,"With great Mexican food for the value, this restaurant by far surpasses others in bang-for-your-buck type return. Almost always offering specials, there is not going to be a night where it's not worth going and trying something new. My wife loves it, and it's definitely a favorite of mine now, too.",1
4738,"Authentic Mexican hot chocolate, which is an acquired taste, came out scalding hot. So...Be careful. The churros are light and crunchy, and the chocolate shot for dipping was a great equalizer for their sugary finish. Fun vibe, we would definitely go back.",1
4739,"Unimpressed. I've been wanting to try out Xoco for a long time and was excited to finally get a chance on a rainy Saturday afternoon. The line system for a table was confusing and there was no one at the front to give directions (dine in customers have to wait until the host gives you a table nicer and then you can get in line to order, but they don't give you a card or anything with your table number on it). I got the Saturday goat special sandwich with a cup for water and it was $15! That's an outrageous price. When I finally got my food it was fine, nothing special and way too salty (and I like things that are salty). Really disappointed with the food, customer service and overall experience. I don't recommend anyone go here.",0
4740,I’ve been here three times now and I’ve always had an awesome meal! I like the format of service here; you order your food at the counter and then get a number fast food style. The food is far better than fast food though! Their churros are awesome and I recommend this place to anyone looking for quick and delicious food!,1
4741,First time back at Xoco and it remains delicious. They serve tacos full time now which is a life changer for me. Hand made tortillas make all the difference (of course the filling was perfect as well). The line is a bit goofy though. I'm assuming it's a table management issue to keep it moving so slowly but it kinda harshed the vibe to wait so long to order. Unclear if the cashier is always also the bartender or if they were short staffed. But the flawless tacos make it all worth it.,1
4742,"The service was great, the only thing I didnt like was my brother ordered extra chips and because you pay upfront, the waitress didnt want to bring them. That was kind of akward.

I ordered the torta ahogada with a fresh water of the day, to drink . I also ordered a polvoron with an authentic hot chocolate. It was cold that day and it was the best.",1
4743,"Great place for breakfast! My whole group was able to order and be seated with no reservation on a Tuesday morning. Polite, friendly servers brought delicious tortas, churros and the house hot chocolate to our table. Love that they have a guacamole bar!",1
4744,"Has been our favorite Mexican place for many years. The best chicken milanesa torta in the United States and their tacos are absolutely fantastic. Hands down best
Mexican food place in Chicago.
Love it!!!!",1
4745,"Awesome Mexican place with a contemporary twist.  I had ""Ahogada Torta"" which was delicious with ""Fully Dressed Guacamole.""  Pretty good beer selection.  Service is pretty fast.  You can always get your order to go if there isn't enough seating.  During the summer they have small outdoor seating area.",1
4746,"Their sandwiches are top notch, and the churros are heavenly,  but the salads are laughable.  I've tried their namesake salad,  and while the chicken on it is absolutely perfect,  the salad overall was mediocre.  Last week I had their seasonal salad with cauliflower, chicken, and beets...  It took 20 minutes to make during off peak hours,  and had a tiny amount of toppings.  I paid over $13 for romaine and arugula with a little bit of chicken,  a few beets and literally 3 small pieces of cauliflower.  Go for the tortas,  not the salads because you will likely leave disappointed.",1
4747,Excellent Tortas and hot chocolate! We came on a Saturday so had the opportunity to try the daily special goat barbacoa. Very tender meat with a delightfully spicy tomatillo salsa! Bread here is also really great with a crisp crust and tender crumb. Rich hot chocolate afterwards was great.,1
4748,"If you like authentic Mexican food, than this is not your place.  Went here for lunch and was surprised at  how small the seating area was and how long I had to wait for my food.  The food tasted like it cook over a wood  fire, but that is all the favor it had order extra dripping  sauce if want any type of seasoning.  I was not happy with my food  for that high amount of money.",1
4749,"I had a veggie breakfast taco. It was okay. Looking for a little more flavor. Adding guacamole instead of just 🥑 would have been ideal.
Wasn't given water. I drank from my own bottle.",1
4750,Not your millenial's avocado toast - it's insane good! For the seemingly high cost expect a generous amount of fresh guacamole with chunks of bacon on homeade bread. Got mine topped with broiled shrimps.  Two can share as a light lunch along with a mug of their thick Aztec hot chocolate.  You can get good tacos anywhere in Chicago. I'd suggest trying the other flavorful entrees for the best experience.,1
4751,"Took my wife's family out for dinner while visiting the city. This was an excellent experience, everyone loved their food, service was top notch, and the churro pistachio dessert is a must - incredible!",1
4752,Can't beat these tortas and the guac is great. Great little quick stop in the area. Can dine in or carry out.  It does get pretty crowded but the staff does a great job of getting your food quickly and there's some great communication in that well run place. Hot chocolate is only okay sadly.,1
4753,"My friend was really wanting to eat at a Rick Bayless restaurant so we decided to go here before a night of going out. At around 6 on black Friday. It was busy but I think we had just beat the crowds since we were able to get seated within 10 minutes.

The ordering system is a bit interesting, but you basically get assigned a table number, and you order at the counter, telling them your number. Then you get seated at that table. We ordered the chicken tinga tacos and the pork tacos. We also ordered a side salad, but I think they might have mixed us up with another table because instead of the side salad, we got the pumpkin seed dip.

We hadn't ordered the dip, but they let us keep it, and it was really good! It's almost like a hummus, but has a different flavor that I can't really describe. The chips were a little salty, but the jicama and cucumbers were both really fresh and tasted great dipped in the dip. The chicken tacos were really flavorful and well cooked. The avocado added a nice creaminess, and the salsa on the side provided a nice kick. The pork tacos, on the other hand, weren't as saucy as the chicken, but the pork was so so so tender! The salsa verde that comes with it gives it just enough flavor to prevent from being bland. I really like the pork ones because they weren't drenched in sauce to make you feel unhealthy.

The salad we had ordered wasn't coming but when we asked about it, they actually brought it out. Again, I think they might have messed up and given the dip to the wrong table, but it was nice that they let us keep it and still gave us the salad. The salad was pretty bad though, in my opinion; the dressing was just off for me -- too vinegar-y I think.

Overall, Xoco has a lot of hype because of it's celebrity owner. The restaurant is a twist on Mexican, so if you're looking for authentic tacos, there are other places to go. The atmosphere is busy and lively, and the prices are acceptable for the area. I would probably be willing",1
4754,"This has been the only restaurant that I try and order from every time I'm in Chicago. The food is incredible. I realize that so much has changed with COVID-19, but waiting 40 minutes for a take-out Torta, while others arrived later and received their food before me was disappointing. I have full confidence in Rick Bayless and his restaurants, so I'll return and give this one a Covid pass.",1
4755,I was really surprised that this place got a four star rating or higher. I eat Mexican food quite often so I was excited to try this place. First parking is a challenge. Second they tried to sit us at a table with other people. When we go out to eat we don't want to sit with people we don't know. We want to enjoy each other's company not someone else's. Third they say this place has the best Tortas? The bread was hard that they serve it on. Also I ordered the Chorizo Torta and I couldn't even taste the Chorizo because it was covered in a sauce that took over and made the Chorizo nonexistent. This place also charges you for chips? This place was just ok.,1
4756,"XOCO is one of our favorite places to eat in Chicago, especially if you are in the mood for a more interesting take on Mexican food. The Milanesa Torta is amazing, and the Tortilla Soup keeps us coming back. We also enjoyed the loaded guacamole. We definitely recommend XOCO for anyone looking for a casual yet delicious stop in the city.",1
4757,"Place is amazing.  Not too long of a wait, only about 15 minutes.  Food was delicious, service was top notch.",1
4758,Anything off of their menu is delicious. I’m so happy to see true Mexican cuisine. Nostalgia hit me when I first found out they had cochinita pibil. My neighbor use to make it for special occasions when I was a kid and haven’t had it since. That’s something you don’t find in most Mexican restaurants. Their salads and tortas are yummy. Chilaquiles for breakfast are amazing. I love nearly everything about this restaurant. Eating here brings me great joy!,1
4759,"Unbelievably phenomenal! Tried Carne Asada Torta, Churros, and Margarita! All were super Impressive!",1
4760,"The food at Xoco is excellent.  I don't think I've ever had anything that I didn't like.  For the tortas, I usually alternate between the Pepito and the pork belly special on Wednesday.  The chips and guacamole are fantastic.

It's also great for coffee and hot chocolate.  The hot chocolate is ridiculously good and the chocolate cafe con leche is much, much better than the mocha that you'd get at the Starbucks around the corner.

The restaurant is a bit cramped and service gets a bit slow.  If you're in a hurry, it's probably not a good idea.  Because there's not a lot of room, prepare to be herded by the staff as they attempt to keep walkways clear.",1
4761,"Vegetarians and Pescatarians beware! We went years ago and enjoyed it, but it was very disappointing this time. Our posole and vegetable sopas were sadly lacking in flavor, our hot chocolate was cold and when we let our server know she wandered off to “check the temperature in the kitchen” and never came back. We cut our losses and left. This place used to be amazing, but the lack of menu options for vegetarians and pescatarians is beyond disappointing, and the service was substandard.",0
4762,"I love the food here, especially breakfast, but I hate the seating.  My family of 4 had to sit facing a wall on barstools last time I went.  Not comfortable and difficult to talk to each other.  Everything else about the place is awesome, I just wish the layout wasn't so weird.",1
4763,"This restaurant has a large variety of delicious tortas creations. One of my favorites is the Chicken Tinga (one of the seasonal specials) as it was very tender yet creamy from the sauce and avocado. In addition, the guacamole here has great toppings. This place fills up pretty quickly in the evening so come early if you want a table.",1
4764,"I love mexican food and the food here is great, I crave it all the time!  We either take it to go or sit at their counter outside.  I wish they actually had more outdoor seating.  Sometimes the line and the wait for you food can be a little long which is the only downside.  Overall, service here is pretty good and they turn out high quality plates for an affordable price!",1
4765,"Awesome food. Mexican with a little bit of a twist. The fully clothed guacamole changed my life. The only downside is that they have bar style seatimg instead of tables, but I loved it anyway.",1
4766,It's our favorite place for Pozole soup. We normally ask cashier to split it for us and it's still a generous portion. Big enough and great tasting so the sandwich we couldn't resist is going home with us.,1
4767,"Good food overall, but I was a bit disappointed, because I couldn't feel the Mexican style so much. The drinks are amazing and the closest you'll ever get to Mexico. The place is small, so, if you are going for lunch, get ready to wait a bit. And man, prepare your cards, because the please is expensive. A simple lunch costed me $31. Compared to other places in the area, that's quite expensive.",1
4768,This place was pretty good. I prefer more authentic style tortas from mom and pop stores but there was a solid variety and interesting styles at xoco. The bread is unusual for tortas (usually expect softer breads) but the taste worked well with the sandwich. The crispy pork belly was cooked very well. Prices are steep (around 14-15 for a torta). I'd personally rather buy a 5$ torta from a taqueria then come here again.,1
4769,"Went there for breakfast and had the scramble with chorizo. It was delicious and the flavors were on point which is what I would expect from a Rick Bayliss restaurant. It's a casual eatery where you order at the counter and they bring you your food. I was there really early and I was assigned a seat, I can imagine that this place gets very busy later on in the day.",1
4770,"I am from mexican culture and I was looking forward to some good mexican cuisine but was fairly disappointed. I ordered the choriqueso because I love chorizo. The bread was way too hard, there was too much onion, and for the price, it was not worth it. I don’t not recommend to come if you enjoy authentic mexican cuisine.",0
4771,"I come here and will always be baffled why some people go to soulless Mexican food chains like TB and the like.

Fresh, authentic with contemporary
spins on classics. Satisfying throughout.",1
4772,"We stop in and get churros for a treat to take back to the hotel whenever we are in Chicago.  The pistachio glazed churros are amazing.  The churros are nice and crispy on the outside, but still soft in the middle.  The glaze isn't overly sweet and you get a good amount of chopped pistachios.  Be prepared for a bit of a wait since this place is always busy.",1
4773,"There's not a lot of standing room here if you're waiting for food, but other than that the experience was awesome. For a reasonable price, you can expect to walk away with some very good food. The churros are (obviously) amazing, and their sandwiches are very good as well. It gets my two thumbs of approval.",1
4774,The food was absolutely amazing. We are definitely coming again!!,1
4775,Had some vegetarian pozole. It was flavorful and sooo good!,1
4776,"Fantastic food quality for the price. Very unique dishes in a good way and almost gourmet. Hip with lively music, outdoor seating available, and some drink selections of Mexico brands.",1
4777,Great food. When ever we come to Chicago we make sure to stop here. The tortas are sooo good. Have to try the torta de milanesa.  Great service as well,1
4778,"Amazing food!
But one warning, try not to go here in the summer, for it gets very hot in here! I literally even with fans turned on, overheated, I couldn't wait in such a big line in the heat, that I literally passed out(so embarrassing).. that I had to be sat down in a chair... and given cold coke to drink so can get sugar back in. After ate, and drank soda I felt much better.
I only removed one star, cause it got extremely hot in there! Other than that, good food! May return. Heard it gets colder in there, in the winter years? I'll perhaps, try to come than?",1
4779,Love their Woodland Mushroom torta! They are veggie friendly on some of the dishes and everything tastes amazing! Love this place. The pricing is reasonable and the food is a little messy. Great spot for a date.  It does get pretty crowded lunch and dinner time and in the summer the line goes out the door so the best thing to do in that case is go inside and just get it to go! Way quicker! I do wish the place was a little bigger - every time I go I feel like it's a sardine can with employees running around and everyone squeezed in. The sitting arrangement is pretty strange - I feel like a lot of time I get seated where I'm just facing the wall lol. Maybe in the future they can expand a little but great spot and love their guacamole and their chicken torta is amazing as well! I go every chance I get!,1
4780,"I was excited to try this place being a Rick Bayless fan.  My sister and I choice this as our first stop in our trip to Chicago.  We got the popular torta ahogada and a xoco salad.

The torta was placed in the bowl with half of out dunked in the red sauce.  The drug half was good. The wet part was overly soggy.  So eating quickly is recommended. The torta was spicy.

The xoco salad was simple.  Nothing special.  I left a bit disappointed. BUT... we did decide to come back another day and try different items.  On our second trip we got the pork belly seasonal salad, guacamole and chips and the pistachio churros.

This was more like it.  The pork belly was delicious and meaty! The dressing was a nice barbeque heat.  The guacamole was actually shooter fresh tasting. And the churros were really great! The second trip definitely redeem the first visit.",1
4781,"Food is always good and great, their counter service system isn't great. They tell you a number for your table and you are expected to remember it(a ticket printer would make sense and be a justified expense.) You wait in line and you are immediately taken to your table after you order in a game of ""follow that guac"" if you ordered the guac. Everything is great but sometimes the table they sit you at could be the one next to the kitchen door and the dining room is empty Or half full. The desserts are great too. The menu is not vision friendly either. It's a slew of waiting in line for either 20m or 2m, and if you forget your number there's the yelling for the host to remember what number you were given.
4stars because the food is great, but the clusterf*** that is the table numbering system",1
4782,Incredible restaurant experience. It's just classy enough that you can come and not feel like it's a sit down restaurant but fancy enough that it's not Chipotle. Food is pretty good. I love their outdoor seating.,1
4783,"I ate here the first time in February while visiting my sister and absolutely loved it. So naturally I was excited to visit again when I got together with my sisters this month. We got off to a rough start with a hostess who is apparently known to be a problem with customers and staff but Arthur, the store manager, came to our rescue! He totally remedied the situation and went out of his way to make our experience phenomenal. Can't wait to come back!",1
4784,"My wife and I stopped in for lunch and shared a couple tortas.  I had the short rib and my wife had baja chicken.  Both were delicious.  The meats were tasty, the salsas both paired nicely, and the bread was nice and crispy.  I'd recommend both tortas. The chicharones were only ok.  The toppings were good but we were expecting them to be hot.  The margaritas were a little pricy for the size but they tasted fresh.",1
4785,"You order at the counter, but a host helps you find a seat. I wish the atmosphere was a bit more roomy/relaxed. However,  the food is incredible. All the employees were hustling yet very friendly.",1
4786,Rick does it again!!! Goat barbaccoa and Short Rib tacos full of flavor in a fun filled atmosphere. Friendly and helpful front of the house who switched our table 3 times before our food was ready to give us the best seat available.,1
4787,A great place n friendly staff n fast service . Tacos at happy hour are really worth it .,1
4788,"Most likely the best sandwiches you can get in the city. Also, its one of the few places I can go to, order ANYTHING off the menu, and I'll love it. Save room for dessert because their ice cream and churros are out of this world.",1
4789,"Wow, Xoco makes me so excited to try out all of Chef Rick Bayless' restaurants! I typically think Mexican food to be a value play since its tasty and cheap, but the flavors here and the offerings have now put Mexican cuisine more on my radar! I had the Ahogada Torta which was an amazing sandwich dunked into a tomato soup and it blew me away. Best part is that the prices are reasonable!",1
4790,"I don't know where to start with XOCO-- I would have never tried this place if it wasn't for a coworker's recommendation. From the outside, it seems like any other food setup in Chicago. Step inside and things change. You immediately get hit with aromas of spices and fresh vegetables, you hear the sizzling of different cheeses and fried meats-- suddenly you know you're in for a good meal.

The spot itself has decent seating, but it isn't too big or too small. It's not somewhere you'd go to socialize and interact with others; rather it's a spot to come with friends and grab a bite or two. Service here is good and pretty straightforward; you go to the cashier, order your food, and are assigned a table.

Things I Liked:

Baja Chicken Sandwich - I got this sandwich twice, a testament to how good it is. You get locally sourced chicken with a fantastic chipotle mayo, slaw, black beans, and queso fresco. It sounds pretty typical, but one bite into this savory sandwich will have you wanting for more. I highly recommend getting it with a side of chips and fries.

XOCO Margarita - It's your typical margarita, albeit with Grand Marnier and it is SO good.

Things I Disliked:
Nothing!

Insider Tips:
*Get the chips & variety of salsas
*Try the chocolate!",1
4791,"Putting the sublime food aside for a minute, which easily puts the fare at the best gastropubs in Chicago to shame, something must be said about the above and beyond efforts of the staff to make the customer experience absolutely wonderful. No matter how big the crowd is here and how busy the staff is, they manage to provide service which is as much personalized as it is efficient, all without breaking a sweat. I brought a couple of colleagues from out of town here a few weeks ago and the wait was too long for a table so we decided to carry out instead. While we waited for our food, which wasn't long by the way despite the Thursday evening peak, we were given the option to order drinks. We went with the Xoco Margarita and I would be remiss if I didn't admit that it was one of the best margaritas I've had in a long time. By the time our food was ready, we were as happy eating it standing outside on the street as we would have been sitting at a table inside. Goes to show that the team at Xoco understands that just because you have the best food on the block doesn't mean you should skimp on customer service. I know I'm already a die hard regular and my colleagues want to come back next time they're in town. High marks all around to the excellent management team at Xoco.",1
4792,I get the camarones a la Diabla torta...and Churros.... delicious 😋,1
4793,"Despite the 4 stars and over 3000 reviews, my expectations were not unusually high for Xoco. I expected some decent Mexican fare but nothing out of this world. Honestly, I was just hungry and in some desperate need for something to satisfy my hunger pains.

Stepping inside, the hostess was very friendly and helpful. She gave us menus to peruse and once we found some items to our liking, she directed us to the cashier after assigning us a table number. The cashier will ask for your table number with your order.

We ordered the carnitas tacos and the vegetable caldo (meal-in-a-bowl soup). They have a machine that dispenses both regular water and sparkling water, with glasses available on the side so you don't need to ask them for any. Once we were done ordering and getting our waters, the hostess showed us to our table. Not too long afterwards, our food came.

We got four carnitas tacos ($12). The tacos have guacamole, onions, and cilantro. They were really good and flavorful. I gobbled my tacos and instantly wanted more. The real winner of the meal, however, was the caldo. Typically, I don't order veggie soups at restaurants since they're usually bland and devoid of ingredients. This veggie soup, however, was fantastic. It had black beans, zucchini, mushrooms, potato-masa dumplings, avocado, serrano chile, and other greens. All for $10.50. It was very filling, and it tasted so, so good. I was very surprised at how hearty and delicious this caldo was. It really is a meal in a bowl of soup. The perfect dish for a cold day in the Windy City.

I would absolutely come here again. And I wish there was one where I lived. I know Rick Bayless is a prominent chef in the Chicago area, especially with the popular Frontera Grill and Topolobampo. Xoco is a great addition to his restaurants.",1
4794,"Overpriced and skimpy portions.

The ""prime rib"" tacos did not taste any differant ""steak"" tacos from any real Mexican restaurant and are smaller than regular tacos.

I don't mind paying more for something special or better quality but the lunch I had was just a small step above Chipotle.

Great presentation but I'm sure most normal people wouldn't willingly pay more than twice the price for presentation alone.

I'm avoiding anything with Rick Bayless's name on it from now on, he takes simple cheap food and makes it look good and then slaps on ridiculous prices.",0
4795,I had the torta ahogada medium spicy. Delicious with some heat. Get a couple of napkins because this is like a soaked Italian beef in terms of mess. More bun integrity but it still takes some dexterity and speed to keep things together. My wife liked her mushroom sandwich and our other lunch companion said his cubano was the best he'd ever had. It seems you can't go wrong at xoco.,1
4796,"Amazing Mexican food, you order at a take out style counter and it gets delivered to your table.  We had the Chips and salsa along with guac followed by tacos.  Didnt need the chips and salsa along with the guac just ended up being too much food that was all DELICIOUS!",1
4797,"Excellent place to check out. My first time on recommendation. I tried the Ahogada sandwich (think 2 halves of a Cuban sandwich (carnitas) sitting in a bowl of chili sauce. Added guacamole and a margarita. OK I admit I ordered a bowl of pasole (hominy cooked with chilli flavors and carnitas or chicken) but had to ask for it to go - ran out of room. It's a different concept - order when you walk in and they bring it to you. Looking forward to another visit when I'm in the area. They have a sister restaurant around the corner and one in the United terminal at O'Hare. I'm a fan.

The picture is from the bathroom!",1
4798,"Delicious and fast.  Lots of options and i love the fast paced and energetic environment.  Not always a lot of seating but theres take out.

Update literally two minutes later.  Wow the 4 leches cake is amazing.  I can die happy.",1
4799,"Refreshing margaritas,great service and delicious food.",1
4800,"Tecate beer was great, queso fundido, pepito sandwich, and amazing churros with chocolate dipping sauce! Great stuff!",1
4801,"The black bean with carnita caldo was fantastic as well as their hot chocolate. My kids got the Ahogada and the Chicken Tinga tacos and they loved them...home made tortillas, and wonderful toppings on the tacos.",1
4802,"The food is fabulous in comparison to most restaurants in Chicago--flavorful and properly cooked with special care taken to each dish made.  I enjoyed the drinks, the guacamole bar, the churros, tortas--all of it!  However if I so decide to eat here again I will be ordering takeout due to the restaurant itself.

Firstly, the staff all have this syrupy voice you would be more likely to hear from a Disney World employee, the forced niceness that tells you that person is reciting a script.  It isn't nice, it's actually kind of creepy.  I was instantly weirded-out by the cashier's almost robotic persona.

Secondly, I was unaware of a seating arrangement in this cafe.  Nowhere on the website or in most reviews does it mention anything about a seating arrangement.  We were placed indoors originally but opted for outdoor seating due to the good weather.  It actually was a step-by-step process to get our table changed and we were not allowed to simply seat ourselves.  After waiting for someone to grab the attention of the hostess I was beginning to think it was a waste of time to even ask, but they were kind enough to offer us the outdoor seating we requested.  Again, we were assigned a table.

Thirdly, the seating outside is by way of long tables with stools on the sidewalk.  This would not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that sharing tables is part of the cafe's motif.  I have never before seen a restaurant that requires patrons to get up and move out of the way to seat other patrons, much less to box them into their own seats.  We were seated together with strangers uncomfortably and it made it difficult to have any sort of conversation with the person I was eating lunch with due to lack of privacy.

After requesting our food to go, we were approached by the manager of the establishment who thought we were unhappy with the food itself.  We tried to explain that we were simply not aware of the seating arrangement and were simply trying to have a private lunch, and as introverted people by nature we were not interested in sharing a table so closely to strangers.  He gave us an order of guacamole and chips topped with our choice and our drinks for free as an apology, which we thought was a little overboard but effective nonetheless.  We did leave happy and enjoyed our food near the river instead, but from now on if we eat here we will definitely be ordering and taking it home.

I highly recommend for this establishment to touch more on the motif of this cafe in a more upfront manner to customers, as we were completely caught off-guard by this despite having researched and planned our trip here (as we do with most dinner outings).  Apart from these issues with the actual establishment, this is a lovely gem in Chicago that puts out quality food and top-notch service to those customers who demand it.",1
4803,Tasty Mexican food which is quite expensive given the small portion sizes. The pepito sandwich with caramelized onion and jalapeño peppers was tasty and the green salsa it came with really tied it all together. The chips were good but on the chewy side and the guacamole had a complex mix of ingredients but was tasty. The churros were also small and came with berry ice cream but actually tasted better without the ice cream.,1
4804,Had the Choriqueso torta.  Very good!  Wasn't overly spicy or heavy on vinegar flavor (which I've had elsewhere).  Very fresh ingredients.  Finished with a churro and hot chocolate.  A great meal on a chilly night.,1
4805,"I don’t really understand the hype about this place. I realize that the desire is to try to take Mexican food and do something new and original with it.

The problem here is that everything “original” is not an improvement on the original version. When you eschew  the traditional bread from a Mexican torta and replace it with a baguette-even a tasty one-it turns into something other than a torta. And when you make churros really skinny they get tough. And when you cover them with sauce they get tough and soggy.

That said, most of the flavors I had were very good ones. And the habanero salsa that came with the sandwich had a wonderful flavor, although it was really too hot to eat, as I was warned.

So if you want something different, you might try it, but if you want a tasty Mexican lunch, look for the little food counter at the back of most Mexican grocery stores. You’ll get better stuff there.",1
4806,"Worst place ever. The waiter took our order, but she never place it. She finished her shift and left without saying anything to the others serves and we were the only table there, JUST ONE TABLE and no one asked us if everything was ok. We wait 40min for nothing and they charge us the chips, they didn't even offer us a discount or something. First time there, never coming back.",0
4807,"Met a client for lunch, his choice and it was good. Open window atmosphere and great barbacoa. The staff is great too, if you get the chance get Kathy to serve you she is great!  Street metered parking available. Little pricey but worth it!",1
4808,"I had to post an edit to this review. I did give XOCO a 5-star review because their dinner was awesome. Today, I went there for breakfast and now I have to lower my review to 2-stars. I ordered the chilaquiles. They were downright awful. The only thing I could eat was the fried egg. To top it off, I saw one of the line cooks/prep cooks using his phone (checking his texts or Facebook) then cutting vegetables without washing his hands. Now, if you don't know, a cell phone is one of the dirtiest items a person owns.

Original 5-star review: This is a gem of a restaurant!! I had the carnitas soup and it was unlike any soup I have ever had - it was delicious with lots of flavor. If you are in Chicago, definitely eat at XOCO; you won't be disappointed!",0
4809,Awesome place for lunch!,1
4810,"Yummy food!   My husband has been wanting to go here for ages.  Glad we finally made it on our visit home.  Crowded space,  but for good reason.  Good customer service and worth the wait!",1
4811,Love to take away tortas from here for a quick lunch time to time. Delicious combinations.,1
4812,Like the vibe.  Very friendly service. I'm sorry to say that it fails on the food.  I ordered the chorizo torta and it was very bland.  The cheese was waxy and it really looked unappetizing.  My friend ordered an odd sandwich that seemed to be in a bowl of soup which turned out to be hot sauce (maybe watery salsa),0
4813,"We loved it, margaritas were so refreshing, it could be a long wait so make sure to get there before the rush like we did!",1
4814,Great food and cool vibes eating on the street,1
4815,"I travel to Mexico regularly.  This is bad Mexican food, made worse with bad service.  Cochinita pibil is one of my favorite dishes.  They simply don't know how to make it. It is not just roasted pork with some pickled onions thrown on top of it. To make matters worse we did not get all of our order.  I asked 2 different waitresses to check on this. I watched them go directly over to the manager and ask him about it. But the rest of the order never came out after about another 20 minutes. Then after about another 15 minutes I went over and asked the manager directly. He didn't seem to care in the least and offered no solution.  I actually almost expected the word ""duh"" to come out of his mouth by the look on his face. All he would have had to do is say ""sorry I'll bring the rest of the order"".  I left pissed off without the rest of the order.  I won't be back and I'll be sure to tell everyone I know how they treat their customers and apparently don't know what real Mexican food is.",0
4816,"Chicken tinga was good, quantity was less though; could do with 1-2 more tacos. Churros were good, especially the thick creamy sauce. Liked the side salad, would have been helped by a bit of cheese though.",1
4817,"Recommended by friends who are married for 7 years.  We went here to celebrate our 16th.  The BEST chocolate ever.  I don't think I can go back to regular chocolate.  Careful though, their mild is still kind of spicy for me.",1
4818,"Delicious food, specially the barbacoa special, churros and horchata! However, please get rid of the mesquite, egg plant, shrimp salad! It was horrible. It was mostly lettuce and arugula. It was not tasty at all. Would not recommend! 😣",1
4819,"Arthur, especially,  and the other hosts were so welcoming. My 8 year old said Arthur was extraordinary! This is our favorite place when we come downtown (or at the airport). The food is outstanding and the churros, brought hot and fresh to the table, are delicious.",1
4820,"I ate at Xoco for the first time last night and it rocked my world. I eat Mexican food all the time, and this is definitely some of the best I've had in the city. My girlfriend let me try her Carnitas. It was a bold, flavorful soup full of fresh local ingredients. The pork was tender,  the potato-masa dumplings were small and doughy, and the chayote, roasted serrano chile, greens, arugula, and avocado blended to make everything zesty and sweet.

I had the Milanesa torta, a crispy chicken sandwich with black beans and pickled jalapenos, served with a side of tomatillo avocado salsa. Just like the carnitas, the ingredients were fresh, the service was prompt, and the dish was impeccably prepared.

The seating is a little cramped, but Xoco is definitely worth a visit. Even if you don't have room for a meal, they have an incredibly dessert menu. The homemade churros are fried sugary glory.",1
4821,The food is amazing. The sauces are perfection.,1
4822,"I went to Xoco for the first time for breakfast a few months ago after picking up a friend from the airport super early.  Totally worth the trip, I ordered more than I could eat. Empanadas were amazing. The Mexican hot chocolate and churros were to die for. Finished off the meal with the ice cream and it was a great breakfast.  Go early to avoid lines!",1
4823,"Limited vegetarian menus, often crowded and loud. Visited this place three times. Twice: my ordered menu was wrong but I never said anything, because too many people around. and our group was in hurry because of limited lunch time.
But colleagues liked it.",1
4824,"Even in a town with as many good restaurants as Chicago has Xoco stands out simply by serving really good Mexican food. No frills, no gimmicks, just great food served hot. Oh, and the lemonade was great too. And the churros. Don’t wait, go now.",1
4825,"I've had their pozole, chicken torta, and huevos rancheros on separate occasions and enjoyed them all. Distinctive flavors and textures. I'm not always a big fan of chipoltle flavors, but they do it really well. Hot chocolate I think is good, but it is not everyone.",1
4826,"Don't let the ""little sister"" restaurant fool you - this place has amazing food, delivered at lightening speed.
All the awesomeness of Frontera, but less formal. Don't try to eat here with a larger party after 5pm, it's tricky....but definitely a great spot for amazing food.",1
4827,"I love rick bayless. I respect him so much as a chef. He is one of my favorite Tv chefs (one plate at a time) and I love that he is so fit and does yoga hahah. His food at XOCO is phenomenal. I always get the shrimp torta when it’s available. Otherwise it’s the chorizo one. I ALWAYS get churros with chocolate dipping sauce. I lick that cup dry too and I don’t care if someone is watching me. One time I was sick and got the soup and even though it was pricy for soup, the flavor was amazing.",1
4828,"Best churro I ever ate in my entire life.... And I old and eat a lot of churros.... It was the one with the pistachio glaze. I mean, wow.",1
4829,"Mexican street food at its finest, outside of Mexico! This is a Rick Bayless restaurant, and boy, it did not disappoint! The energy from the employees is infectious. Everyone just seems to happy and excited to be there! Yes, the lines are long, and the wait to get a table can be a hassle. BUT, it's worth it. The hot chocolate is to-die-for, and the churros are perfection: crunchy and sweet on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Dip them in chocolate sauce (or, do like me, and ask for honey! Try it, it's soooo good!), and you'll be in heaven! My sister and I did not go there for dinner; instead we went there for dessert. We went to Rick's other restaurant, Frontera Grill for dinner and it, too, was phenomenal (but a totally different vibe). Go to both!",1
4830,"I could eat xoco everyday. Everything I've ever had here is truly amazing!  The ahogada is my favorite.

The seating options can be unfortunate, since there are several bar seats facing walls.  But don't let this bother you.  I promise that you will not be disappointed.

Update:  Every time I come here, I leave extremely happy.  Today, I tried the Thursday special -- beef tongue torta.  OMG -- So. Good.",1
4831,The pork belly chilaquiles dish was amazing,1
4832,"Yay for Rick Bayless and his love for true Mexican fare. Rick hit it out of the park with the offerings at this fast paced corner joint. Whether it's take out or dine in, you can bet your food is fresh, well made and with the best ingredients.

I had the pleasure of having dinner and breakfast. If you arrive after 10am, they can still provide some items on their breakfast menu.

I have fallen in love with this place and look forward to my next visit to Chicago.",1
4833,"First visit fell short of expectations.
Ordered the Cubana Tortas off their grill sub-menu and regular churros.  They messed up my to-go order (handing me someone else's food); glad I checked before leaving. It took them about twice my original wait time to correct it. The pork loin was very dry and I could hardly taste black beans.",0
4834,"Fabulous hot chocolate!
It's a little confusing when you first enter. Just remember, line up to order, pay, be seated, served, enjoy!
Everything on the menu is amazing and tasty and fresh.",1
4835,Well priced for the high quality of the food! My fiancé's family is from Mexico and he said this was the best torta he's ever had,1
4836,The food was not even close to what good Mexican food tastes... we had some soups and we couldn't eat them( we didn't like them). As we were still hungry we ordered the churros which were pretty good. The only thing i would go back for. Service was very good,0
4837,"If you want extremely high quality Mexican-inspired food, go here. If you ever wanted to go to frontera (or, god forbid, topo) but were turned off by the price or wait times, go here. The food is amazing, some of the best ""fast"" ""mexican"" I've ever had. I wish I still lived here so I could return.",1
4838,Such good food here! The tortas are incredible. The drinking chocolate is to die for. Tip: check Google for peak hours and go when it's a little slower.,1
4839,"Excellent food, was out pretty quick for a walk in order. Meal was superb. Had the mushroom torta, wife got the Carne Asada, both were delicious. Guacamole with queso and Pepitas, with the house tortilla chips, made for a delicious road snack.",1
4840,Food was great and it was affordable too,1
4841,"Mmmmmm, Rick Bayless Mexican street food inspired grab and go... enough said, I think. The tortas are amazing! I've tried at least half the menu now, I can't say a negative thing about any of them. The minor negative, the long lines at lunch! Get there early or eat lunch late to avoid them and your set though!",1
4842,"Best tortas in the city! Try their seasonal specials -- current rotation includes a pork belly torta with pickled butternut squash and spicy pumpkin hummus. They also have great desserts (including churros with chocolate dipping sauce) and drinks. It's a popular lunch spot, so be prepared to wait a few minutes for a table.",1
4843,"Fresh and high quality ingredients combined into surprisingly dull and flavorless dishes. Pasole floated beautiful hominy in a broth that was without a hint of red Chile, or any other herbs or spices. The salsas were both limp and bland. Guacamole was very nice, probably because it requires nothing but fresh avocados. This restaurant would last about 5 minutes in a city like LA or Austin in which people really know Mexican food, and there is a good reason why it is strategically located is in the heart of tourist heaven and not in the Pilsen neighborhood where it couldn’t compete with abuelita's cooking.",1
4844,Food was great. Very tasteful. Wish I could say the same for the service. It was horrible. Seems to be a running theme in Chicago. Hope they can get it together doesn't matter how good the food is if the service is horrible.,1
4845,"We'd wanted to get breakfast, but we were rushed. So we got churros and chocolate coffee. The first bite of churro said it all. When you get the flavor of corn masa in a churro, it's the real thing. Anyone who had eaten one from the place on Olvera St in LA, or on the Plaza in Mexico City, know's what I mean. Then, the cafe con chocolate was perfectly mixed. Wow. I've been a critic of Rick Bayless comida, no lie. But this redeemed it. Maybe I'll even go back to Topo. Maybe.",1
4846,FANTASTIC Mexican fare! Best hot cocoa I've ever had in my life! I came to Chicago for a restaurant tour weekend and out of 11 places and countless dishes the Aztec chocolate from XOCO is what i'm thinking of a week later!,1
4847,"I've been her during the day, and the madness has seemed to die down. The elevated take on street food is always packed with flavor. All the Rick Bayless quality you'd expect is there, and the style of food seems so different to anything around. The churros and chocolate are what keeps me coming back.",1
4848,"mexican food, yeah, very delicious. I love this place, great food & service. Really nothing but enjoyable experiences here, I'll be back. This place has a cool design. Mood here reminds me of Colorado Springs area.",1
4849,"After a long day of walking all over the city we needed some good food. What do Angelenos tend to crave when on vacation? Mexican Food. Don't hesitate to stop at this little joint in downtown. It is small, yet charming. The staff has mastered the look and feel of being laid-back despite the urgency and focus in their execution of tasks. Decent variety of South of the Border Beers. I order a Negra Modelo and she had the cider.

What we ordered:

I ordered the CUBANA (torta/sandwich) smoked Gunthorp pork loin, bacon, black beans, avocado, spicy morita, artisan Jack cheese, and chipotle mustard. The Mexican version of the Cuban classic did not disappoint. The smoked pork loin with the sweet bacon and the mustard just worked together. Brilliant.

She ordered the MILANESA (torta/sandwich) crispy Gunthorp chicken, artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapeños, red onions, Napa cabbage, tomatillo/avocado salsa, black beans. Not as spicy as expected, but flavorful nonetheless. Fresh ingredients will do that.

We shared:

the CHIPS & SALSA which were served with tomatillo salsa, 3-chile salsa, just-made chips.

...CHICHARRONES served with Tamazula hot sauce, queso añejo, onion, cilantro, lime. (Could have been a little crunchier for my taste)

... and finally the ALMOST NAKED roasted garlic tomatillo Guacamole with choice of two toppings (we opted for the chicharron and Mexican cheese). I was losing hope with the ""Avocado"" experience in Chicago (being from California we are a little spoilt), but Xoco managed to make the perfect guac.

Don't let the exterior fool you. Come in.",1
4850,"Affordable alternative Mexican food offerings by renowned chef Rick Bayless. No reservations here as you fall in line to order your food, find a table, and your order will find you. Expect long lines which was worth the dining experience.",1
4851,They don't take reservations. Worth the wait. There Jamaica water was delicious 😋. Staff is very attentive of there customers.,1
4852,"Always delicious.   Had one of the specials today, the carnitas and mole torta.  It was on point.",1
4853,"Quite possibly the best Mexican restaurant outside of Mexico. I've never been disappointed. Sometimes the wait is long, but that's because it's soooo good. Get the guacamole, choriqueso, or the best thing on the menu: the ahogada.",1
4854,I came here twice during the two weeks I was in Chicago. My favorite things on the menu that I tried were the Pepito Tortas and churro. The Pepito Tortas had roast pork and was the best tortas I've ever had! The churro was the best churro I've ever had. I definitely recommend visiting this restaurant if you ever get a chance!,1
4855,"What can I say, almost everything off the menu is amazing.  Most of the food gets tie in a wood fire oven so you get that nice smoky taste.  Try the churros for desert, they area GREAT.",1
4856,"I am drooling remembering my meal just a few hours ago. The chips were fabulous and the accompanying salsas were fresh: salty and tangy in the perfect amounts. I ordered a torta (the cubana) - which was VERY expensive for my typical budget but completely worth it. Delicious. Crispy bacon, creamy fresh avocado and bread - all melty with the cheese. I don't know the first thing about what authentic mexican street food might entail, but as for a chicago lunch: I can highly recommend.  Churros were freshly made and the large sugar crystals gave an extra crunch. All good in the hood.",1
4857,"Ah xoco. Love you in the summer.

Think of a cute little restaurant in Italy/ Spain and thats what you have here. Outdoor seating so you can people watch and sandwiches to help you get over the 5pm craving. I tried the Chicken Tinga and it was pretty delish, i loved the dipping sauce that you get to put on it. Couldnt get enough of the stuff! Oh and dont forget the churro at the end.. crunchy and sweet and comes with a little chocolate dipping saucer.. so yum!

Atmosphere is cute and has cafe feel to it. The lines are typically long, but once you order, the server brings food to your table.",1
4858,"I LOVE XOCO.
Seriously, they make such great, fresh food. I love Rick Bayless' style of cooking and seasoning things just right. The tortas are really great and the caldos hit the spot on a cold winter day in Chiberia!
I'm also quite partial to the churros. Paired with the ice cream OR a cup of Mexican hot chocolate, it's pretty killer. Suck it up, the calories are worth the deliciousness here. You won't regret it.
And the line is usually not too bad. I've never waited more than 15 or 20 minutes even at dinner time on a weekend.

A great cheap way to get some Rick Bayless food in you!",1
4859,Went here at 12 for lunch with my fiance and our engagement photographer. Our photographer told the people that she has an extreme tree nut allergy and she was assured that there would be no issue with what she ordered. 30 minutes later her eyes were swelling shut and she could barely breathe. Not cool.,0
4860,Great authentic food. Loaded guacamole is the bomb! Ordering and waiting for table when busy is a bit confusing though. Pricing was fair. Margaritas were excellent!,1
4861,"Love Rick Bayless and really like this street food inspired ""faster food"" spot. If you're staying in a River North hotel or need a spot for a breakfast meeting, Xoco is a solid option. I really like the tortas but check out their constantly changing specials for seasonal and local dishes. Oh and save room (or calories) for the hot chocolate, it's as good as everyone says.",1
4862,This place has ruined guacamole for me because their guacamole is just perfection and I can't get it anywhere else now :-) the Cochinita Pibil sandwich may just be the best sandwich I've ever had. It gets really crowded during lunch time and lines are long. I recommend you go with plenty of time ahead since seating is limited. Don't forget the churros. They are made fresh to order,1
4863,"Let me just cut to the chase...the Churros and hot chocolate are over-the-top, roll your eyes to the back of your head AMAZING. You know when you eat something, and it just makes you happy? For the maximum flavor experience, dip the churros in the hot chocolate and THEN eat. I'm STILL thinking about those churros and hot chocolate.  I had the original hot chocolate, which is very rich, so I was only able to drink about half of the cup. This dessert and the fact that I saw Rick Bayless in the restaurant the night I went were the highlight of my evening.

I also enjoyed the guacamole, which was smooth, creamy and flavorful, as well as a couple of tortas. The tortas (the ahogada and choriqueso) were a little on the salty side for me (particularly the chroriqueso) and while they were good, I probably wouldn't order the ones I had again.  I do want to try the soup the next time I go, as there is an interesting selection, the portions are huge and they looked delicious.  I'd also love to go back for breakfast for my beloved churros and hot chocolate.  This will be my new indulgence.",1
4864,"Best to get takeout, but the server was very friendly and helpful. If you are getting takeout, its best to order online as they currently do not take call in orders for pickup. Had the Cubana and churro's for dessert. The Cubana sandwich could have used more dipping sauce but was very tasty. churro's were quite good and definitely one of the best I've had.",1
4865,"Even in a town with as many good restaurants as Chicago has Xoco stands out simply by serving really good Mexican food. No frills, no gimmicks, just great food served hot. Oh, and the lemonade was great too. And the churros. Don’t wait, go now.",1
4866,"I've never had anything but delicious food and good times at Xoco. The line is always long during lunch but the place manages it well and it moves fast. I love the ceviche if you are looking for something light and fresh, but definitely the pizole if you need something that sticks to your bones. One of the only affordable yet still worthwhile lunch spots in River North and that alone is enough to earn the five stars.",1
4867,"great food, but poor logistics. the hostess had no idea they had my order ready. she even asked me and still they could not locate my order,  I spent about 30 minutes waiting for an order that was ready, they knew the order had been sitting there and decided it was ok to serve it like that. thank you for wasting my time and for the mollete ice cream bar...",0
4868,This was the best vegetarian Mexican food I’ve ever had. Nice ambiance and music also.,1
4869,"Come here for the churros and tortas! Excellent sandwiches on toasted bread but make sure you are prepared the food is spicy!

Always a good option to switch things up during the week. You won't regret this try!",1
4870,"Excellent meal. The ahgoda torta is killer and never had any better tortilla soup in my life. Great job Rick!
Seating could be a touch more enjoyable.",1
4871,"I ordered something that was too spicy, and a worker gave me small strips of chicken for free that were amazing!! Also, another worker gave me free ice cream! Overall the staff's really nice, but the food is expensive.",1
4872,"Rick Bayless is a foodie god and knows Mexican street food.  There's so much I still need to try because I stick with my favorites:

Chips and Guac:  some of the best in the city (close second to mine)

Ahogada:  My fave!  Pork isn't my favorite meat, but this is just amazeballs.  The tomato arbol chile broth is unreal.

Pepito: Delicious!  The meat is so tender and marries well with the caramelized onions and beans.

Baja Chicken:  minus the mayo, the perfect chicken sandwich is my book.

Don't miss out on the chocolate and churros.  Best churros in the city -- so addicting!!

I've never enjoyed the Caldos, so I just stick with the tortas.  And don't be afraid to ask for extra sauce with your Tortas.  The staff is super friendly.",1
4873,Amazing soups and quick service if you don't go during lunch. The beer selection is also some of the best in the city if you enjoy microbrews. Don't forget about desert! Best soft serve in Chicago!,1
4874,"We ordered the seafood caldo (stew), the ahogada (pork sandwich dipped in sauce), and a pistachio churro.  The seafood caldo was tasty, full of seafood and flavor.  The ahogada was good as well, the sauce made the sandwich less dry.  I would skip the churro though.  It was cold and dry.  The pistachio sauce was supposed to help with the dryness but it was too sweet.  I feel like the churros here are premade and they just put the sauce when they serve it to you.  The churros at Xurro are better since they're freshly made.  I would just order the entrees and skip the dessert.",1
4875,Absolutely some of the freshest and best food around. I'm surprised it wasn't more packed in there. RiveNorth has some really good food spots but I will be back here. I had the Cubano 🇨🇺 Torta. & the desert was really good as well.,1
4876,"I love that every animal served here is from a local farm, and the farm is named.  I like knowing that I'm not eating torture meat.  Also, it's Rick Bayless so everything is cut and made to order- the cooks aren't pushing around a gray mass of beef that's been on the grill since noon.  Simply a good, top-quality mexican restaurant.  I'd only avoid it because of the wait.",1
4877,"Xoco was a great spot for a more casual dinner with a small group. The seating/ordering situation wasn't super intuitive, but we didn't have any wait at all. The highlight was definitely the churros with dipping chocolate - easily the best churros I've ever had.",1
4878,"As I was googling Xoco, I saw a note from a reviewer saying “Rick Bayless is the man”.  Well, I’m a Mexican bien and raised in Mexico and relatively  close to true culinary personalities. I used to agree with that frase from my fellow reviewer; anytime a visitor would come to town, a visit to frontera, Topolobampo or Xoco was mandatory, and the experience was always
Outstanding.  About a couple of years ago, things started to change... I got a bowl (which I know, you will say a connoisseur of Mexican fare will never do, but was under time pressure and cracked under the recommendation) and it was bad.  Then a few weeks ago got some churros at Xoco... they used to be heavenly, crisp and full and the chocolate sauce thick and pure and just heavenly.  Churros were much worse than meh.  They were translucent, skinny and dripping with what smelled like old reused oil.  The chocolate sauce, previously thick and rich, is now closer to a sugary Hershey’s syrup.  The cochinita torta used to be carefully crafted, crisp bread with a succulent slow cooked citrusy pork and sharp, almost aggressively hot but fresh, crisp and a definitive habanero flavor.  Today’s torta was a mess, with most pork on one side of the torta, the pork too tangy, no earthy achiote taste and the habanero sauce also too limey, with h just a hint of that rich Yucatán orange pepper.  Rick used to walk around Xoco and personally checked things... not sure if he is still doing that but if he is, it is not working. He needs to reapply the high standards that made him who he is today.  The assembly line setup and consecuential results speaks volumes about a focus on quantity rather than quality.",0
4879,"Everything about this place is good.  It's a lot like the Frontera at the airport but more selection. You get some of the authentic taste of Rick Bayless other places,  but for less money and effort.  The ahogada is delicious but messy.  Even the iced tea is better than anywhere else.",1
4880,"Love the tortas here. Great fast casual place for super high quality food. Reasonably priced and fun to go. This is always a place i recommend to people when shopping around the area, not many great casual places close by.",1
4881,"This place is great! High quality food layered with complex flavors and textures served at approachable prices in a casual and comfortable setting.
Breakfast enchiladas are out of control!",1
4882,Walked in around 7pm on a Friday night and was able to get a table quickly. The carnitas tacos were delicious and the portion size was good for an entree.,1
4883,"Really enjoyed my lunch... Got the short-rib tortas sandwich and I highly recommend it. Seating could be more comfortable but I'll take that minor inconvenience.

Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",1
4884,All their tortas are excellent. I think the milanesa is my favorite so far. Their chips and guac are also excellent altho I would recommend getting the guac naked instead of with all the extra fixins. They also do a solid breakfast/brunch.,1
4885,"The seafood cocktail rojo had plenty of shrimp and scallops but the sauce was flavorless. We were excited to try the Saturday goat barbacoa torta, but the goat was flavorless. Sad face.",1
4886,"Always a great spot for a quick Tex mex dish with a twist. I think it’s moderately priced for what you get. My done-in experience was good, but would just rather get it to go and not deal with the process.",1
4887,Went there for breakfast.  I hand their version of avocado toast which was excellent.  My son tried the French toast with bacon which he loved.  Will definitely be going back.,1
4888,"Well, that's an experience!

Bottom line:  very tasty food that's not as expensive as it seems (since much is easily shareable), and a loud, warm, friendly atmosphere make this a pleasant spot to eat and people watch.

I ate at Xoco by myself tonight and would enjoy going back with a friend or small group of friends.  Here's what I ate:

- Chips, guac, and salsa
This was one of the only (mildly) disappointing parts of my meal.  The guacamole was, well, heavier than I expected, and the chips were both too salty (especially to pair with guac and salsa) and pretty much indistinguishable from store-bought corn chips.  The two salsas, though, were mild and very tasty (both on the chips and for dunking my torta in!).  By the way, portion-wise, this'd be absolutely fine to share amongst 2-4 people! (it was a hefty scoop of guac!)

- Orange / passion fruit fresca
Small (considering the large amount of ice) and a bit too sweet for my taste, but still quite refreshing.

- Chicken tinga torta
Wow!  The chicken was very tender, and paired just perfectly with avocado, cheese, onions, and light spices... but especially with the deliciously crisp and perfectly baked bread!  Everything was in exactly the right proportion, and miraculously the whole thing was not only melt-in-your-mouth good, but also not messy in the slightest; most tortas I've had in the past quickly sog up the bread and everything falls apart.  Not this torta!  Dipping it into the red sauce... mmm mmm!

- Churro with chocolate dipping sauce
HOLY DELICIOUS!  I'm just angry I didn't get the order-of-three instead of my single churro.  It's hard to describe what made this churro so amazingly awesome, but... it just was.  Perfect texture, not too sweet, not greasy.  It was everything your standard carnival churro is not.  And the dipping sauce?  Well, if you're expecting hershey's syrup, you'd be in for a bittersweet surprise, because this wonderful thick chocolate sauce was definitely on the bittersweet side.  Complimented the churro delightfully!

and lastly...

- ""Authentic"" chocolate + water drink
I hesitated to order this.  Watered down chocolate?  Not milk?  Sounded pretty unappetizing to me, but hey, everyone raved about it so I had to try it.  And I'm sure glad I did!  It was like drinking a melted high-quality bittersweet chocolate bar with small flecks of cacao beans, and I mean that in a very good way.  Though I happily drank the whole thing, I would have been just as pleased to share this with one or two others since it was so very very rich.  I'm actually worried about having trouble sleeping tonight after that!

*  *  *

Oh, and about the wait?  Well, undoubtedly due to my good looks (ha!) I was plucked out of line and given my own seat at the end of the bar, given chips + guac almost right away, and my torta barely 15 minutes after that.  Apparently for the masses, the wait was 15-25 minutes this Friday evening around 8pm when I visited.  Still not too bad.

Well, it's my last night in Chicago for this trip, but I hope to be back to Xoco.  Can't wait to try other tortas... and more churros!",1
4889,"Muy delicioso! Love the bread they use, the sauces, the chips, the agua frescas! Rick Bayless' smaller, casual spot is a big hit in River North. The line is always long & sometimes longer b/c you can't order until they have a seat for you in the super small dining area.

What to order: Woodland Mushroom Torta, Milanesa Grilled Torta, Vegetables & Black Bean Caldos (big ass soup), chips & salsa & Churros with warm dark chocolate dipping sauce

Tip: Order carry-out to avoid waiting in the line. Call ahead or go straight to the register by the door and kitchen and order from the hostess.",1
4890,"Xoco is one of my favorite spots in the city! I've never ordered anything that wasn't absolutely fantastic, but specifically the Ahogada and Pepito Tortas are so amazing. The bread is baked in-house in a wood fire oven and you will have quite a challenge trying to find better bread anywhere else! Get a pistachio churro!! You won't regret it!",1
4891,"Food was too salty to eat. Unfortunately, we got takeout because the wait to sit down was so long. I had the carnitas caldo and while it had potential, it was too salty and I had to abandon eating it. My daughter found the meat in the  abondigas torta dry and charcoal like and the entire sandwich too smoky. The bread was burned. The guacamole was ok but all in all, I expect more from a $32 lunch.",1
4892,"There isn't a ton of seating area, and the few times I've come during peak hours, the line is out the door. The ingredients are fresh though, and Rick Bayless does a great job with the flavors and spices. I usually get the Ahogada torta, and churros & ice cream for dessert.  For the Ahogada, you can choose your spiciness level (I usually do mild because I can't handle too spicy). The pork is delicious and bread perfectly toasted.",1
4893,Great food. Prices are reasonable. Will visit again it I am in the area,1
4894,"Worst Pozole I have ever tasted in my life.If I could give it negative stars I would. The broth was diluted, no flavor, only had hominy no meat. It was overwhelmingly salty. Gave us 1/4 of lime. Terrible",0
4895,"Only love this place for the Milanesa torta , rest is pretty okayish. Best place to go get food after clubbing in river north area . Their mushroom torta is supposed to be real good too but I’m not a big fan of mushroom so a pass for me.",1
4896,"Hoping to enjoy a nice night out in the city I was left with nothing beyond sheer disappointment after eating at XOCO. The most unfortunate part is that I was excited for the food after reading so many glowing reviews. To start, as a party of three, our food arrived rather promptly. The wait was not too long, but not exactly quick. While waiting to place our order and moving to our table, my expectations grew dimmer. The food that I saw on other tables, coupled with the irked temperament of the counter staff meant everything was going downhill fast. Fast forward to when we got the food. Person A (me): my torta lost its taste almost immediately and I use the word taste loosely. Once I realized I was paying to taste the napkins on the table I was hit with a strange after taste that I cannot even begin to explain. Maybe plastic? I don't know what it was but I had to put it down immediately...that sauce didn't help by the way. I can continue, but I'll move on to person B: her meal was basically a piece of cardboard rubbed on charcoal. When they say ""smoked"" they mean that they bathed it in charcoal. To quote ""I think I'm eating a cigarette."" And finally person C: might as well have given us warm water. Because anything that was done to the soup to add flavor didn't quite work out. If I were to close my eyes I'd think I was in a pool, the soup was so bland. Much to our dismay, person C had ordered dessert. The ""flan"" was a perfect exclamation point to our night at XOCO. If you own a cat, open up some of that pattè (s)he likes and put it on your plate...TADA! I don't think I've ever exclaimed ""ew!"" after taking a bite from food until now. Overall, I'd give this place a rousing 0 out of 5 if I could.
Best way to describe this place is bland and tasteless, but for dessert it taste like old and expired candy.",0
4897,"Great quick dinner after a busy day site seeing. Had the Wednesday special and the guacamole,  both delicious.  The salsas were also excellent.",1
4898,"XOCO is a classic pricey Mexican food spot in the heart of Chicago. Honestly didn't really enjoy the fast food vibe and sit down restaurant prices, but the food is pretty good. Fun to try, but wouldn't make my go to Mexican spot.",1
4899,Hostess is not very efficient and it takes a long time to get seated even when I see empty tables. Food is terrific otherwise I would not go there,0
4900,"It nice to see someone as famous as Rick Bayless walking around on a random Wed night. The attention that he gives to his restaurants shows in the quality of the food. The wait can be long at times, but I've always felt like it was worth it. Get a sandwich, try a churro and sip on some delicious coffee. You won't be disappointed. Note - The habenaro sauce is not for the weak",1
4901,"I was fortunate to try XOCO when I was with a small group of close friends. That said, we decided to share our order so we could try as much as we could on the menu.  After a 20 minute wait in line was extremely satisfied with the meal. Loved everything I was able to taste:)  As long as you have time, I would recommend this place. It is worth the wait.*Order at the counter.",1
4902,Great food. Highly recommend Papito Torta Sandwich. Good clean ambience. Halal creekstone option.,1
4903,"Fast casual but super fresh, super authentic, super tasty, and super cool environment. Of course you expect nothing less from chef Rick. Bravo.",1
4904,"GET. THE. CHURROS. They are fantastic, and the tortas and soups are filling, delicious and not expensive. Coffee and mexican coffee are excellent, and they have a variety of other unique dishes. Every time I visit Chicago, I make a point of going to one of the several XOCO locations, and they serve some of the best mexican food north of Texas.",1
4905,Incredible food. The Cochinita Pibil is amazing. Any of the chocolate drinks are worth trying. Simply the best. Big bonus...Chef Rick Bayless also gets produce from local farms from here in Illinois. (Watch the documentary Sustainable!),1
4906,"My go to spot for mexican food.  Rick Bayless has done it again.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here.  The milanesa is my absolute favorite.  The margaritas are a little pricey, but well worth it.  Great churros and chocolate to complete the experience.  It deserves 6 stars!",1
4907,"Such a great place! Their tortas are out of this world, and their margaritas are a must have. Additionally, the service is great and attentive.",1
4908,I loved the intense smoky flavor of the cubano. The eggplant sandwich was also good.,1
4909,It's a great restaurant to go into on a cold winter evening. When you walk in and see all the big bowls of soup you just know that in a few moments you'll be enveloped in warmth and comfort. The atmosphere is a little departure from the typical River North experience. Once you enter you're immediately greeted with a line that you have to walk through to order your food. The wait gives you a chance to spy on what others are ordering and allows you to change your mind 10 times before you reach the front. During busy times the place can get a little too loud for comfortable conversation but that didn't scare me away. The big bowls of caldos and tortas are worth the wait and buzzy noise. If it's especially blustery out treat yourself to one of the many different hot chocolates and churros on the dessert menu. It'll prepare you for the cold outside.,1
4910,"Guacamole, pulled goat griddle sandwich, and soup are mouth watering",1
4911,"Have gone past here several times and it is always crowded.  Was finally able to eat here.  This place is casual and reasonably priced.  It also is really small and you will wait for your food.  They have you sit down and they bring out your food to you.  I had the carne asada Tortas which was really good and tasty.

The only reason I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait time.

#CitiExperts   @GoogleLocalCHI   #PartyOnLG",1
4912,"Holy moly. Everything here is absolutely delicious and stunning. You really can't go wrong. I was craving meat, but we wound up not getting a meat dish. I was still not disappointed because it was THAT good and filling. Amazing place to eat.",1
4913,Great food and atmosphere. Breakfast was amazing.,1
4914,They do have vallet parking,1
4915,The torta was killer. The guacamole was perfect. And everything was so fast!,1
4916,"I've had the tortas by Rick Bayless at the Ohare Airport many times. However, the tortas here doesn't taste quite as good as the one I've had before. I think the quality of the one at Ohare is a lot better. I had the Pepito torta. The meat was too dry and there was only three leaves of arugula and it didn't look fresh either.",1
4917,"There are places you go just for food and this is one of those places. Service is bad and all over the place. We ordered chips, coffee and some food. My coffee came cold and chips came 20 minutes later after multiple requests since we saw people who were seated after us get their orders. The ordering system is so bad. Food was ok.Dont think I'll ever go back.",0
4918,Good food! Very popular place. We had to wait in line to eat here for lunch on a weekday.,1
4919,"Great Tortas and soups.  Don't expect to leave stuffed as the portions aren't ""Chipotle"" sized, but the flavors are incredible!  Highly recommend the Tortas (sandwiches), there are plenty to choose from and they are all delicious.",1
4920,"The service, food, and place was great in general. The food that I ordered was really good, along with the options on what to eat. The only thing that wasn't really good was the kind of loud music. Other than that really fast seating. 5/5",1
4921,"Xoco is Mexican greatness. Churros with chocolate.  Thank me, then Rick, later.  Tortas are off the hook. Pibil is like it came out of a Yucatecan pit. (That's a good thing.) Service is different but everyone is very friendly and helpful. The hype is real and the prices are worth it.",1
4922,"I wanted to like this place a lot more than I did given that it was a Rick Bayless restaurant.  While it says ""Mexican"" the menu itself is pretty limited.  More or less tortas, desserts, and a couple side items.  Not a full service restaurant... it's short order.  They did have a good margarita and the service was prompt.",1
4923,"Xoco is the least expensive of the Bayless block of restaurants on Clark.  This definitely does not mean that it is the least tasty.  In fact, I think that they're equally good and give the nod to Xoco for providing delicious fast style food.  The sandwiches here are quite amazing.  You're in for a serious treat if you like spicy.  The desserts are good but not as stellar as the meal options.  Each sandwich will run about $12.  It's not cheap but it is delicious.

This place isn't one to dawdle.  You stand in line to order your food then take a seat to wait for it to arrive.  I feel guilty taking up a table while others stand by waiting so.  Nobody rushes you to leave but you should be in and out to be courteous.  Also depending on what table you get seated at, you may find that the place is a bit tightly packed.  There always seems to be a line so be prepared to wait (don't worry it moves pretty fast).  The wait is definitely less than at the other two higher priced Bayless choices.  With food just as good (just different) I highly recommend coming to visit if you are a Bayless fan.

Tip: If you love the food at Xoco, be sure to hit the O'hare airport location (Frontera Kitchen) when flying in or out.  The line is shorter and is probably the best food you'll find at the airport.  This is extra incentive to get to the airport early :)",1
4924,"Phenomenal restaurant for a reasonable price, probably my top 5 favorites in Chicago.  The tortas are amazing, especially the Saturday special Goat Barbacoa and Milanesa.  If you go during peak times (any day from noon - 1pm or weekend nights from 7-9), there could be a lot wait to be seated.  Additionally, XOCO is closed on Sunday and Monday, which is inconvenient.  I've seen Rick Bayliss occasionally conversing with customers.",1
4925,The hype is real. Spicy Chicken Churro was phenomenal. Best guacamole I've ever had. Period,1
4926,Love their Xocolata! Great place for quick bite. Owned by Rick Bayless - he really does try to expose the Latin/Mexican culture to nonHispanics - and actually allow you to appreciate the food! Good place for Breakfast and lunch - and if you just need a quick evening dessert to go - grab a hot chocolate and churros!,1
4927,"I have eaten here multiple times, and each time loved it! my must have dish is the torta ahogada! The spicy broth with a pork torta served in it is outstanding. It reminds me much of the kind you'd get at a small place in the town in mexico my parents are from. A must try from one of chicago's best!",1
4928,"I got off the plane at 7am, got off the train at 8, had breakfast in the loop and was still hungry. Got to Xoco at 9! There was no line, but the guy in front of me seemed to think he required extra attention. I finally put in my order and sat down. Already 6473 steps into the day and I was ready for a nice spicy skillet of chilaquilles! Damn they were good. Been a fan for years and was not disappointed.

I went to Frontera grill for dinner!",1
4929,"I don’t know you pronounce “XOCO” but I do know how to pronounce “delicious”.  Authentic Mexican cuisine meets Soviet politics with this classy little joint.  Just don’t order chips if you sit outside, people will try and snatch them away!",1
4930,Maybe the best sandwich I've ever had. Crazy good. Worth the stupid long walk I took to get there.,1
4931,"Fantastic food, very busy spot in downtown Chicago.",1
4932,"This is a fun place. The food is good, but I would not necessarily wait on weekends when there are long lines. The sandwiches are tasty, but they are just sandwiches. The chocolate dip is great.",1
4933,"If Rick Bayless is involved, you know you will get your money's worth and more. Anything we have ever tried has been amazing. At Xoco the shrimp torta is awesome, cochinita pibil is spicy wonderful and the goat barbacoa is amazing until they sell out. The guac is delicious and they even have damn good pozole.

Xoco is not at O'Hare, but they have a mini Xoco torta spot that I always always hit up when I travel. Similar tortas and breakfast tortas that are on point. I have a mini crush on Rick Bayless fare.",1
4934,"The cubano is to die for; I ordered it as-is and it was amazing.  It is easily in the top 10 sandwiches of my life.  It's that good.  Also, get the guacamole ""fully loaded,"" as it is equally awesome.",1
4935,A must visit while in Downtown Chicago when craving authentic Mexican food,1
4936,"Choco cappuccino is amazing and so are the tortaas.
Cocktails are average",1
4937,"This was my first experience with Rick Baylesss' brand of Mexican cuisine and now I can not stop recommending people to drop in for the experience.  By Chicago standards, XOCO is still a little pricy for what you get and is the only reason that I dropped off one star. Once you order, the food will arrive quickly but be prepared for a line due to its popularity.
A patron will most likely walk away $20 dollars lighter after enjoying a small meal but I will be the first to admit that they will walk away blown away by the experience.
Other then the price, the food is great and every visiting foodie to Chicago must go.
One helpful tip that I give people when they go is to buy the dessert when initially order.  It will save you a lot of time because after you realize how good the food is, you will not be able to resist the urge to try his sweeter creations.
Also, Dont be afraid to try something new when you go.  Many people look at the menu and are nervous when they see some of the ingredients.  Through caution to the wind and try something new.  You will be glad you did.",1
4938,Fantastic mexican food here. They get your food ready super quick and it tastes fantastic. The mexican corn dish is probably one of the best I've ever had so you should definitely give it a shot. I highly recommend this place.,1
4939,"I love this Rick Bayless place.  YOu cant go wrong with any of the tortas, but the caldos are great as well.  I love their margaritas too!  Can get crowded on the weekends esp during lunch time, but a weekday for lunch is a great way to go.",1
4940,"After years of listening to my personal training clients talk about XOCO, my fiance and I finally ate lunch in their space...and we weren't disappointed! The food and service was outstanding, and I would I highly recommend their menu to anyone in the mood for Mexican food with a flair!",1
4941,"Xoco is amazing and their food is really high quality and very tasty! I like to mix it up and try the different tortas. I am always surprised and pleased with their food!

I live a block away and have so many food choices , but Xoco is always at the top of the list!",1
4942,This cozy restaurant is very good. They serve Mexican street food. I had the Cubana and highly recommend it. Great blend of flavors and texture. The service was friendly and helpful.,1
4943,"Rick Bayless is not Mexican and neither is XOCO (in my opinion). I came here for a friend's birthday and when she told me we were having lunch here (I secretly rolled my eyes). I had a salad- chicken, spinach, arugula, tomatoes, avocado. The food was good, but again, Rick Bayless is not Mexican so he's obviously going to give it an American twist.

The space is small so be prepared to wait or have your food to-go.

If you want authentic Mexican food, I suggest go to the south side (Pilsen/Bridgeport)- you'll get better food at affordable prices.",1
4944,"It was alright,  the chicken torta was fatty and not enough chicken and pieces of skin on the chicken.
I also had a to go order and it took some time to get.   I had my meal in the restaurant, so they had enough time to get the order ready.",0
4945,"Absolutely amazing tacos, the tortilla soup is filled with huge chunks of chicken and avocado, and the classic hot chocolate is one of the most decadent things I've ever had.",1
4946,Good carnitas sandwich served in a bowl of spicy sauce. I'v eaten here before and got the hot (habanero) sauce and I've never experienced anything like that before. I recommend the medium sauce if you like spicy. Chocolate cappuccino was bomb also.,1
4947,One of the best sandwiches I have ever had. This place is so good that it’s on my list of places to take my parents when they visit Chicago.,1
4948,Omg get the melanesia torta. It's absolutely Divine! The seating and ordering here is a bit weird but it works for them. Desserts here are always awesome too. Got xoco instead of the other Bayless restaurants. It's cheaper and has pretty much the same content.,1
4949,"Overall, we were dissatisfied with the service, cost, and food.

At 10$ for a sandwich, we were expecting a little more.

Very confusing service. Had to ask many times how things were supposed to be done. We were given a table number when we walked in. We felt rushed in line to order you stand in line with a menu. Then after we ordered 2 sandwiches, 3 churros, and 2 waters we went over the the tables. We searched everywhere for table numbers to find our table. Couldn't find any numbers. Eventually asked a worker which table was table 53 and he sat us. Then our food came out. We noticed there wasn't any water, so I went back up and asked for water. Showed where to get water and brought it back to the table. After going back up a few more times for water we had to go back up for our churros. They came out and we bit into them and we did not like them very much. It is quite possible these are more authentic churros as they tasted more like corn, but was not what we liked. The sandwiches were okay, but not worth the price.",1
4950,XOCO is one of the best lunch places in Chicago. It's fast-casual - and about the same price as many deli places - but the food is so much better than most places of the sort. Top your visit off with hot chocolate and churros - it's delicious!,1
4951,Had a very nice soup here once - it's good I ordered a beer because it was quite spicy - just the way it should be. Highly recommended but expect to wait in line for some time to get seated.,1
4952,"This is my second experience at a Bayless restaurant. The first experience was at Topolobampo which left a lot to be desired.

XOCO's a different story. The space is a little tight, but we were seated after we ordered and maybe five or ten minutes later our food arrived.

I ordered the popular Ahogada - pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, w/ pickled onions. I found the broth to be more salty than spicy. I didn't ask where's the beef... I wanted to know where the pork was.... it was lacking pork. All in all it wasn't bad, but I doubt I'd return again for it.",1
4953,Arrived here at 12pm and per usual there was a long line. The to-go line was a lot shorter so thats probably a better option for people who need to get back to work and still want to eat good food. We got the aztec hot chocolate and it was a little bit too bitter for my taste.,1
4954,"It was good... but I don’t really get the hype yet.
Carried out, they got my order wrong and took 20 more minutes than the estimated time to get my food to me.

I’ll try again sometime when I dine in, but otherwise I kinda regret coming here.",1
4955,Visited 3 times while in Chicago my 5 day stay!,1
4956,"We have been going Frontera grill and xoco at Christmas time for years. Both places failed miserably this year. The food at Frontera was good (once we got it). Service there was so bad we cancelled the appetizers because THEY NEVER CAME. At xoco we had a problem getting our meal as well, when it did come, it had a tepid temperature. We both took our sandwiches apart because they were so soggy.  Positive note: Rick Bayless was there. Negative: he looked angry. Poor service and bad food and one unhappy owner. They are  both off our Christmas list.",0
4957,"Amazing! Really cool place, great ambiance, and beyond than tasty food. I tried the Pepito sandwich. Highly recommended. Will definitely come back for more.",1
4958,Amazing torta's. Amazing churros and chocolate. Amazing Ice cream. This place is amazing. Get the ahogada. It's a torta in a great soup. Line is long during lunch so get there early or go after the rush. Go hungry because there is plenty to try.,1
4959,My favorite Mexican in the downtown area. The chef is incredible and the food is mostly authentic (although the salsa is not that  spicy compared to genuine Mexican restaurants.) This place has my favorite guacamole and horchata of any Mexican restaurants.,1
4960,This place has some of the best Mexican food I’ve ever had! It’s a must to eat here if you’re in Chicago! Great service too!,1
4961,"Fun atmosphere and nice staff. The counter service set up was a little confusing at first but the drinks were good and so were the chips and guac. Only came for happy hour, but it was a good time!",1
4962,"I love their salads! Ordering online and picking up your food is the best way to go during the lunch hours as there is always a long line! Its fast, easy and delicious.",1
4963,"The food was very well layered in different flavors. Had the guac and chips, the chips were fresh and salty. The churros with chocolate sauce were amazing!",1
4964,"Crazy sandwiches, or should I say tortas. Really fresh bread only adds to the flavor of the torta. Just bring plenty of cash if you plan on buying a small cup of guacamole for $9",1
4965,Great guacamole and churros but I wasn't impressed with the pork carnitas. It tasted greasy and flavorless unfortunately. I'm going to assume it was a fluke since the rest of the food was well received.,1
4966,"Rick Bayless does fast food, but you wouldn't know judging from the line which hasn't died since it opened up! They do try to get everyone served efficiently as possible. Everything is spicy, so get your spice buds ready. And definitely do not skip the hot chocolate and churros!",1
4967,"Amazing tacos, churros. Food is freshly made every time. Great service! Absolutely 10/10 recommend!",1
4968,"The food was good, not great. But the service was terrible. You have to order dessert with the meal, but they served one of our entrees, then the dessert,  and the second ten minutes later.",1
4969,"Food is good, but experience is not.  Too small of a place and you end up in some instances sitting at a counter facing a wall with hardly any interaction with anyone. Come on rick,  you can do better.",1
4970,"Love Rick Bayless... this is a really casual place and with an awesome patio section. The food is casual mexican fastfood- lines get really long, so be prepared to wait if you're going during peek times. Recommend anything chocolate... and the churros for dessert.",1
4971,XOCO is the real deal in the cold weather! I love their authentic churros and hot chocolate which isn't too creamy but has enough richness. Service can be busy sometimes but it's well worth the wait and visit if you're in downtown.,1
4972,"My first visit to the Bayless empire. I didn't want to go, I didn't want to like it, but I'll open it - it's legit good and I didn't feel overrun by cultural appropriation (and believe me, I thought I would). I might not make this a regular spot but it would be hard not to include it in your happy hour repertoire.",1
4973,"Delicious Mexican food. The guacamole is a must and you cannot go wrong with the tacos. However, not long in seating.",1
4974,"everything was so yummy.
my favorites are the cuban sandwich and the carne esada (which is only avalibe on Tuesday) the gaqamole is fantastic as well.

the service is always friendly and welcoming",1
4975,"Very nice churros. I got pistachio flavor. Amazing!!
They made it pretty fresh right when I order. If you want best churros in the city,  I think this is it!",1
4976,"Our favorite go-to for weekend date nights.  Great atmosphere, amazing food and not in the slightest bit pretentious.  Love it here!",1
4977,"Excellent food! Cochinita Pibil is hot, but well worth it! Tacos Chicken Things is best she's ever had!",1
4978,Amazing food and relaxed atmosphere. Leave room for the churros!,1
4979,"After having dinner at Frontera, we went next door for dessert at Xoco: soft serve with pepita popcorn, caramel and chocolate cookie dough, plus churros with dark chocolate dip.

The dessert was wonderful and the ambiance was casual and cozy.",1
4980,"This is my favorite place in Chicago for an afternoon snack. I *love* the churros and the hot cocoa - freshly blended and delicious. The *best* place for an afternoon or late morning pick-me-up, especially in the winter!, in Chicago.",1
4981,Tortas were amazing. Tlayuda was amazing. Churros were amazing. All around delicious.,1
4982,"Self service restaurant, line can get very long depending on certain times.  Food is great, an assortment of sandwiches (tortas) and soups.  must try churros with chocolate and mexican vanilla. Lacks ambience but if you're looking for good food this is your spot. A must try for tourists!",1
4983,"If you are into traditional mexican food, You will find it here.. I personally always have a great lunch or early dinner here with out a question, The staff may appear to be in a rush -- Well what can you expect from a fast and busy restaurant. You will find the est mexican delights by Richard and the savoring... well you need to find out your self.",1
4984,"Cannot beat the traditional Mexican street fare here. The selections are always top notch and the combinations traditional but with a modern spin.

What makes this special is the made in house chocolate drinks.",1
4985,"There has been a lot of disingenuous criticism of Xoco recently, most of it centered around being able to find ""better"" Mexican street food in different neighborhoods around Chicago. However, I believe a lot of this criticism to be off the mark and poorly considered. When you walk into Xoco take a look around. Are you in Mexico? No. Are you standing on the street? No. Well, I guess you're not going to get Mexican street food. Though, what you will get is a very good, very affordable rendition of simple Mexican fare from one of America's premier chefs.

The space itself is a tiny rectangle of a restaurant. There is limited seating, even less tables, and, most likely, the line will be out the door when you arrive. Order at the counter, get a number, and your food will be brought to you.

The menu is only slightly more encompassing than the restaurant itself. There are limited options, with the bulk of the menu being dedicated to tortas, a couple of salad options and soups available later in the day. The tortas themselves are good, served on crusty bread and lightly stuffed with roasted meats, beans and chiles. The bread used to make the tortas is more akin to a quality French baguette than a common Mexican bollilo, resulting in a chewier, more substantial sandwich.

Of note is the use of local, artisanal products, like La Quierca Prosciutto, Tallgrass shortribs, and Otter Creek Cheddar, all of which I highly doubt are common on the streets of Mexico.

The gauc was buttery, fatty and smooth, but lacked any discernible flavor (well, other than avocado) while the chips themselves were just chips, nothing too special.

If you're looking for fine dining, I suggest trying Topo or one of the other wonderful restaurants Chicago has to offer. If you're looking for Mexican street food, maybe you should try the Maxwell Street Market. However, if you're looking for another one of Bayless's interpretations on Mexican cuisine, I suggest getting in line.",1
4986,"One word: caldo.  Two words: delicious caldo.  A varied selection of common and seasonal caldo (a type of Mexican soup that's basically a meal in a bowl). Sandwiches and other options exist, but I go for the caldo. All ingredients are local and thoughtfully sourced which only add to and enhance the wonderful flavors.",1
4987,Good concept. Great staff but execution was a little off. Portions were a bit skimpy (except for the chips. There were a lot of chips) and the flavor could be pumched up a bit.,1
4988,"when they brought my food, the server said 'hola!'. so over the top cheesy, i was (and am) stunned. xoco is kind of an express version of the imagination of rick bayless: they wont refill your coffee, you cant sit at the tables, you arent intended to be comfortable. you are intended to eat and leave. had chilequiles on a saturday morning after navigating (somewhat successfully) their bizarre methods of ordering and got something that tasted pretty good but i will still consider inferior to what i get at my local whole in the wall. this is not food that mexicans eat. i am not mexican either, but a lifetime in the city that has a mexican population on par with anything south of the border, i know a couple things. once was enough for me.",1
4989,"XOCO is a great place to try when you want mexican food fast.  The tortas and caldos are packed full of flavor.  The homemade churros are amazing, along with the daily agua fresca options.  I just wish there were more entree options than just tortas.",1
4990,"XOCO has always lived up to it's expectations. I have great respect for Rick Bayless and his style of cooking. Tortas specially the woodland mushroom and vegetable caldo are just simply superb.Tried Chicken Sandwich with Classic Hot chocolate and shared vegetarian caldo with my friend. Limonada is damm refreshing and hot chocolate is the best.

Many a times Rick bayless is sighted inside in the restaurant. Just make sure one arrives early since there are always long queues outside xoco",1
4991,"Soooooo good. Loved the casual and authentic vibe. Had the guac, beef short rib soup, carnita tacos, seasonal salad and the mint chocolate churro sundae and all of them were amazingggg.",1
4992,small overpriced portions and the seafood coctel roja was inedible the  shrimp was old and tasted of ammonia burned this tourist.,0
4993,"I arrived near closing and was very happy to get a seat. It was my first stop at a Bayliss eatery, so I was very excited. I ordered the Seafood Caldo, among other things, but the caldo was the most expensive. My first bite was odd as I bit into a vegetable of unknown origin. I figured it might be jicama, or some other root vegetable, but upon reading description, I realized it was a raw/undercooked potato! Not only that, the potato was purplish indicating it had likely been either par-cooked or peeled and then covered in water. When potatoes dealt with thusly aren't timely used, they turn a purplish-black. THAT'S WHAT I ATE!!!! When I alerted them to the problem, the chef offered me two cookies! What I wanted was to be taken to the kitchen and watch as they threw the caldo out!! So disappointed not only at this happening at a Bayliss eatery, a chef whom I love watching on PBS, but also at the laissez faire attitude with which my concern was met. Great to have met the chef; sad to see my concern was no big deal. I have reported it to the Cook County Board of Health.",1
4994,"Went there for Brunch on Vacation, Wasn’t what I was expecting! Server was ok place was to loud and food wasn’t to good! Online fooled me I’ve had Mexican good and thats not it.",0
4995,"Loved the food.  I had the Choriqueso.  It was probably one of the best sandwiches I've had.  Could've used some salt, but it was good.

The price was a little high ~25$ for 2.  Meh.",1
4996,"Fantastic food at a decent price, with great happy hour specials. The guacamole is fantastic, and every sandwich I’ve ordered has been delicious",1
4997,"Love Rick Bayless. We have heard him speak and love his drive and what he stands for. Buuuut, Xoco has a strange staff vibe. They usher you to a dark bar stool and make it hard to change your table even when the place is 1/4 full. Feels like you’re boarding a plane. Also, they put mayonnaise on a sandwich that was supposed to have sour cream and were unfriendly when approached with the mistake. Too bad.",0
4998,"Rick Bayless' take on Mexican street food is outstanding! Love the beef empanadas and warm tortas (mexican sandwiches). The Mexican hot chocolate is awesome and the grind the beans in the window! Usually a line when they are open, closed on Sundays and Mondays.",1
4999,"We came for the Rolling Stones, stayed for the food. Xoco is fantastic! The pork is what you want to order but you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. By far my favorite spot in Chicago!",1
5000,Reviews are on point with this place. The guac and chips we're fantastic. Short rib tacos were packed with meat and very tasty.,1
5001,"Stopped here for a late dinner, the food was very good and the entire group were very happy with the quality and price of the menu. The staff was very friendly and accommodating our group 7.",1
5002,Absolutely delicious! Hidden gem,1
5003,Really good food. Went on a nice evening and sat outdoors.,1
5004,My boyfriend and I ended up here because we couldn't get into Frontera or Topolabamba. We were pleasantly surprised by the Torta's and salsa they had! Definitely planning on heading back here!,1
5005,Pistachio churro and hazelnut churro! Yum!!!!!!,1
5006,Churus seemed to be a bit skinny and the chocolate sauce on churus was really watery. But overall good ambiance and the sitting area was beautiful.,1
5007,"Great coffee! And is cool on the inside! Starbucks has become a sad place, this is refreshing to go in to and just look around.",1
5008,Delicious and perfect if you're looking for a mindblowing insane amount of calories to add to your daily diet. You'll leave full fore sure. There's usually a line. The service is somewhat fast. The seating could be better accomodating.,1
5009,Arthur and the hosts were absolutely amazing! So hospitable accommodating and welcoming. Not to mention the food was amazing! We will definitely be coming back very soon,1
5010,The pozole and Baja chicken sandwich are excellent. Churros are a must-try! So so delicious when they're hot!!,1
5011,"Everything we've had there has been amazing. If you don't know which torta to pick and can handle a bit of heat from the chipotle sauce, try the cubano!",1
5012,"Enjoyed stopping by for some guac n a margarita.. good service, good was very tasty.. will come back again",1
5013,"The richness of flavors surprised me! It's hard to find Mexican food that's on par to what you find in Mexico, but Xoco doesn't disappoint.",1
5014,The homemade churros here are awesome.  They remind me of the ones I used to get in San Diego's Old Town growing up.  Great place to stop by and grab a snack.,1
5015,"Really great lunch spot, and probably one of the more reasonably priced restaurants in the area",1
5016,"Not fast food. Looks like a fast hot bar, but everything is cooked slow. Delivery is slow. Their guac is pre-made????? Is this a kitchen or a McDonald's?",0
5017,"Xoco is a great way to get affordable RIck Bayless food without waiting for hours.  Although the Menu is small, it is intentionally so.  The tortas are great and the desserts are even better!",1
5018,This best churros and chocolate I have ever had. I always get the chicken milanesa torta or the cuban. Las aguas frescas are really good too!,1
5019,Just love the tortas served here. From mild to super hot. Great chips and guacomole. Good margarita (though a little expensive),1
5020,"Rick Bayless nailed Mexican street food at this quick-serve spot next door to his popular Frontera Grill and Topolobampo restaurants; menu features fresh ingredients for his mouth-watering tortas (Mexican sandwiches), flavorful soups and salads, and authentic Mexican hot chocolate and churros; the food is worth the wait in the ever-present line to order",1
5021,Cozy spot for tacos sandwiches and soups with a Spanish twist. The chicken Milanesa is a go to. You won’t be disappointed.,1
5022,"XOCO is a hidden gem, overshadowed by its big brothers Frontera and Topolobampo. XOCO is the place to come if you want a quick bite - although it will be one of the most delicious quick bites you have ever had. You cannot go wrong with a single food item on the menu. My suggestion? Mexican hot chocolate. Ugh.",1
5023,This place is rocking! They have great food that you can't find at your average mexican restaurant. The only thing I did not like was how packed they were. Maybe a bigger space for how much business they have.,1
5024,Had to wait 30 mins just to get churros. Their attitude is they don’t care how long you wait cuz they think their stuff is so good you should wait for it. Service is not their strong suit. Snobs.,0
5025,Right across from our hotel and lines up. We decided to wander in. Already ate dune but the food looked amazing and the guacamole bar  was so tempting. Had churros to go and we will be back.,1
5026,Really great food and the staff was so nice and friendly I would definitely recommend and will be returning in the future keep up the great work everyone!,1
5027,Amazing blend of Mexican-American food! Delicious! Everyone should try the milanesa 😋,1
5028,"As someone who’s lived most of my life in CA & TX, I’ve become wary of Mexican food outside of border States, but this place is legit. Come, eat and enjoy a quality Mexican meal.",1
5029,"The food is fresh and extremely good. You can't go wrong with any of the items. My top favorites are the seafood soup, mushroom torta and the churros",1
5030,Moist and tender pork carnitas on a crispy mexican style baguette served in a bowl of spicy tomato sauce.  Perfect lunch on a cool fall day in Chicago.,1
5031,you can really get a :) when you come here they treat you great and you get some great treats. amazing churros and and there is plenty of space inside. i love it and definatley coming back with friends.,1
5032,Absolutely the most flavorful combination of spices and ingredients anywhere. I could eat here every meal.,1
5033,"This place was wayyyyy better in service then Fronteria resturant. And the desert was excellent. I had a flan. Came back the next day Saturday for the churro and ice cream sunday, and they did not have ice cream.? What! then take down the display till u do.",1
5034,The tortas (they are all goooooooood) are out of this world. I would also recommend trying the vegetable soup. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is really good.,1
5035,"Great service and great food, all for a reasonable price. Don't forget to grab a cup of hot chocolate and some churros.",1
5036,Love the churros and chocolate sauce. You can go there and just order that to-go. Rick Bayless has elevated the humble sandwich and soup into the stratosphere.,1
5037,Oh my! The food is like your in Mexico!(Well the Mexico I remember) Very good! We had the carnitas tacos and the short rib tacos! 😋yum!!!,1
5038,"Tasty, fresh food and it's Rick Bayless. Prices can get high, but the quality is worth it. The jam-packed crowd shows that it's a favorite of many.",1
5039,Very nice Oaxacan inspired food. The hit chocolate was the highlight.,1
5040,"I just had a Milanese Sandwich sitting at the bar in the Bucktown location. It was amazing. I will now have a hard time trying other items on the menu.

Great!

©",1
5041,"Great classic hot chocolate, really thick and flavourful. Churros were fluffy and crisp! Good stuff!",1
5042,My sister-in-law and I stopped in for an early lunch to beat the lines. I ordered the special which was a beef tongue torta and she got the conchinita pibil torta. We shared. Both were AMAZING.,1
5043,"If you’re visiting Chicago, forget the overrated deep dish pizza and try this cafe restaurant for brunch/dinner. Went there for brunch and kept going back. Wish there was a spot like Xoco in Toronto.",1
5044,"Even though there's always a huge line, it's worth it!  The sandwich drowned in broth/soup is one of the best...plan to dine in!  Get the churros and sipping chocolate too!",1
5045,"Too busy, crowded, and noisy to sit and eat a meal here, however it's definitely worth stopping in on a chilly day to snag a freshly fried churro. Nobody does it better, period.",1
5046,"This place is delicious.  Everything on the menu, the way they make the food, the service, it all works.  Only one gripe, the seating.  It can get a bit crowded and makes the whole experience feel a bit rushed.",1
5047,The hot chocolate and churros were really good. The other breakfast items we had were good but nothing to write home about.,1
5048,"I had the baja chicken sandwhich and it was absolutely incredible!! The service was nice and the atmosphere was modern and laid back, they did have a weird system for their orders though.",1
5049,Absolutely delicious - go between lunch and dinner to avoid the rush. soups and delicious sandwiches as well as beer. get a marisol - brewed especially for goose with rick bayless. churros in the morning with hot chocolate mmmm..,1
5050,I came with a big group here and tried 9 or so things. My favorites were the goat barbacoa and coctel rojo. Maybe the best mean I've had in Chicago.,1
5051,Best of the best - most authentic Mexican food we've tried.  Speedy service and atmosphere is cute.,1
5052,Just had breakfast here and it was stunningly good. I had the pork belly chilaquiles and hot chocolate. I cannot recommend them enough.,1
5053,Was very flavorful.  The Cubana panini was the best ive had.  I wish the margarita was larger but it was tastey.,1
5054,Excellent food in a kinda strange set up. Couldn't quite tell why a number was told to us when we entered. It was where we were to sit and tell the order taker to bring our food.,1
5055,"I've tried all the tortas and they are delicious, same with the ""almost naked"" guacamole and the churros. Highly recommend it.",1
5056,"Churros are wonderful and come with dipping sauce. Great menu, and friendly greeting. Service deteriorated once we sat down.",1
5057,The Milanesa torta was delicious. The only issues I had was the lack of space and if you want water you have to get up and get it yourself.,1
5058,"Every dish here is ¡sabroso! Don't be afraid of the spicy mezcal cocktail, and definitely get the churros for dessert.",1
5059,"Great tasting food, casual atmosphere, and outstanding service!!!  Had the chicken torta which was great.  Churros are outstanding as well.  Would highly recommend!",1
5060,One of the best places to get caldos or sandwhich.  Be prepared to wait during rush hour.  Their pork belly sandwhich or soup is one of the best in town.  For desert never forget to get their churros.,1
5061,I love the sandwiches here.  Great flavor and hearty.  Only problem is there is a lot of pork on the menu bad for me but others will love that.,1
5062,"Some of my favorite food in the city.  Seating is a little small for larger groups but it's still worth it, especially if you have friends from out of town who want to try something different.",1
5063,"Rick Bayless does it again!! It is a great lunch stop.. right by my office! So delicious and can't pass up the churro's. So many diffent kinds, but still love the orginal.",1
5064,"We went to Xoco for dessert and got a churro with the chocolate dipping sauce and the glazed chocolate/peanut churro. They were both pretty good, but we didn't think it was anything amazing.",1
5065,The churros are amazing. Other food is great too so either come for dessert or a full meal but don't forget the churros.,1
5066,Good breakfast option in the area. I enjoyed the wood-oven chilaquiles. Found the churros a bit tough but I am used to continental vs. American churros I suppose.,1
5067,Wow the churros here are great. The bread sandwhiches are good also. Great place to hangout and enjoy a quick not over filling meal!,1
5068,XOCO is Rick Bayless's local sandwich shop. The tortas are freaking amazing and I would highly recommend the Ahogada. It is pork carnitas in a spicy chili sauce.,1
5069,The best fresh made churros!,1
5070,Awesome churros and hot chocolate.  Great food as well.  This is my preferred Rick Bayless restaurant as his others are much more busy.,1
5071,Excellent!   I had the Saturday goat special.  Wonderful!  Very tasty!  Service excellent.   Price good for a Chicago dinner.,1
5072,"They charge u before u get a table, so when u realize how shitty this place is u can't leave... After a $45 lunch I had to get my own refill ... No waiters at all... Place sucks to bad cause I was a big fan of rick bayless",0
5073,Love this place!  Their Cubana sandwich is the greatest sandwich in the history of sandwiches (IMO). :),1

5078,"Nice place. While I didn't fancy my own soup so much, the others seemed very happy with theirs. Staff was kind and service was prompt.",1
5079,"Worth going. Great food, and despite being very busy when we got there they move people through quickly. Try the Milanesa torta.",1
5080,"Great place!  Love Rick Bayless and I cannot wait for the Wicker Park location to open up.  I am going to be spending a lot of money there, but it is so worth it! Highly recommend to anyone.",1
5081,"Good but not great, over rated!",1
5082,It's  one of the restaurants  that I have visit and love the flavors and I don't just like food I love food  and this one is a favorite delicious   in every bite,1
5083,"Loved It. Had the Cubana torta, some chips and guacamole, and a churro with chocolate. Everything was delicious! I'll be back to try more items.",1
5084,"Great, perfectly portioned food, quick service, intimate atmosphere... but maybe a little too intimate, as you're pretty much sitting right next to patrons not in your party and can hear ALL the details.",1
5085,"Fabulous! My favorites are ahogada, Pepito and cubana. Bread is great, service is fast, sauces are very very tasty",1
5086,1st timer and the food was amazing.  I will overlook this time fact that the host asked if I wanted more water and never came back with it.,1
5087,Such a great experience every time. These folks know how to make damn good Mexican food. I especially love the empanadas.,1
5088,"This is good food, very good food indeed! Already planning our next trips here to try all the sandwiches and all the desserts!",1
5089,one of the oldest mexican restaurants in Chicago. The chef follows the traditional   from Mexico. It famuous for it original flavor and amexican ambiance in this restaurant. The dishes are really delicious.,1
5090,Really glad i got to try out the tacos during my week in Chicago! Tasty food and great atmosphere! Busy place!,1
5091,Nice food,1
5092,Bombass tortas just service is slow. They get too busy and forget your order. Waited over an hour and a half to get our dessert.,1
5093,"Amazing food, very casual environment. You queue in line, they find a spot for you while you order, presto, food arrives excellent.",1
5094,Overrated and expensive.  Lemonade was tart not sweet. Tacos were blah...plain not bursting with flavor,0
5095,"Had a mushroom Mexican Sandwich and Churro. Very unique and tasty experience. Small place, but well run..",1
5096,Amazing food and loud music. Generally packed up with crowd.,1

5098,The food was really good but some of the staff could have been a touch better. I’d still recommend trying them out though.,1
5099,Really tasty chicken torta. It tasted like a Mexican version of a Philly cheese steak.,1
5100,"Good tortas - but LONG lines, esp during lunchtime, and very limited vegetarian options. Also a bit on the pricey side. A good indulgence once in a while.",1
5101,"The tortas & the churros were excellent!  If you're looking for the best places to eat in Chicago, you definitely have to go here!",1
5102,Great sandwiches! The best are milanesa and Cubana. The churros are also delicious.,1
5103,"Delicious ahogado sandwiches. For those that don't know what that means, it means a 'drowned' sandwich where the sandwich is served submerged in a delicious sauce or soup. Try 'em all, but be sure to save some room for a churro. Rick Bayless FTW!",1
5104,"A pricey place to grab lunch, but worth it, as it's the brainchild of chef Rick Bayless. You'll love the tortas and dipping sauces/caldos (soups).",1
5105,one of the best churros in town! it takes some time to get the order but it is worth it - that's why there is line! :) love it!!!,1

5110,Great meal. Always a go to for Mexican food. Did not take higher because the Cubano torta was meh.,1
5111,Loved it! Wasn't typical Mexican food you can get anywhere. Great ambiance too.,1
5112,Some of the best tacos in Chicago. Make sure you prepare for a wait during rush hour. Seating is cozy.,1
5113,"Honestly, this place is overrated.  The place is really small (beside the kitchen) and the food not too good for the price (soup too salty, guacamole average).  The service is below average. Unfortunately, it will be our last time",0
5114,"I LOVE this restaurant.  Even though they're are only three options for a vegetarian,  I still come back.  Save room for churros!",1
5115,"Very good Mexican cusine. It's bar not a restaurant but here it's plus. Great food, here first time I tried goat meat.",1
5116,Shared a wonderful brunch with my wife! Were newlyweds! The chocolate is rich! The food is tasty! The serivce is warm!,1

5124,"I""ve been here three times, and everytime I went here I regreted it.  The food is too salty and It's always too crowded to be seated.  The Hot chocolates are just simply too sweet.  How can you mess up Chocolate!!!!???",0
5125,The breakfast was amazing and during lunch the seafood soup is good for a rainy day.  Also their hot chocolate is delicious.,1
5126,One of my favorite restaurants in the country. The Pepito is amazing and the churros with chocolate sauce are delicious.,1

5134,Mango Panna Cotta was very nice!,1
5135,Terrible experience. Not able to sit a group of 9 even in 3 tables. They put all the excuses to avoid providing the service. Think before go to that place.,0

The carnitas tacos and cinnamon churro sundaes especially were 👌",1

5141,Very distinctive modern central American cuisine.  A tad expensive,1

A counter service place that I found kind of weird because the refill situation was tricky. Not great for bigger than a party of 6.",1

5204,Always good but the portions seem like they are a lot less than a year ago.,1
5205,"Growing up in San Diego, I'm a big fan of Mexican cuisine, and for casual Mexican in Chicago it doesn't get better than Xoco.  Save room for Churros!",1

5224,The hot chocolate here is superb. You could go just for that. But while you're there you should try the Goat Barbacoa,1

5840,This place came highly recommended however I found it just average. The food was good but there's nothing to entice me to go back. I couldn't even find a barbecue sauce that I liked. I tried what the server recommended as a sweet sauce but it wasn't very good so I asked for another type and it was $0.50 so be ready to pay if you want to try a different sauce LOL.,1
5841,"My husband has never left chips & salsa on a restaurant table uneaten. I have never left macaroni & cheese uneaten. The restaurant and bar itself is beautiful. The staff was friendly, but made absolutely no suggestions or even asked if we needed anything else when she deemed it was the end of our meal. They use tablets for ordering & payment, so while you’re paying they’re hovering over you for you to hand their tablet back, hate that. The food was mediocre and the portions are insanely small for a BBQ place, but fast to get to the table. The staff is also fast to push you out the door. $50 with a more than generous tip and we left hungry. We won’t be back, but we’re not locals so no big deal. 2 stars because it was edible, but the whole experience was underwhelming.",0
5842,"They did a great job .  We had a huge party.   Got us all seated pretty close to each other in a reasonable time frame.
The brisket queso was disappointing to me .  Not much cheese in there .  More like brisket and gravy the way it tasted. The Texas caviar wasn't that great either . Really bland .
I ordered the two meat special .  I thought the brisket was really good .  The hot polish was ok .  Lots of bbq sauces to choose from .  You get two choices with each order.
Thank you for getting the whole party seated in a timely manner",1
5843,"Neat place, kind of pricey for only getting one side with your entree compared to other BBQ establishments.  The brisket sandwich was good. I'd stay away from the Mac & Cheese unless you like the powdered cheese flavor.  (Could have been a bad day in the kitchen )  However, my waitress didn't skip a beat when I said I didn't like it in offering another side.  With that said the green beans are delicious.   The Carolina Red BBQ sauce is a great touch of heat with great smoky undertones.  Great recommendation from my waitress.",1
5844,"After a long day at an event, we went in search of a local barbecue place and we hit the JACKPOT here!!! This may even be my new favorite barbecue restaurant! The building is an historical building and looks warm and inviting both inside and outside. The first thing we saw upon walking up was a lot of people seemingly waiting for seating. That's nothing unusual for a great BBQ restaurant and usually indicates the food will be worth the wait. To our surprise, we were seated right away. The weather was great and there was an outdoor seating area, so perhaps those waiting had requested outdoor dining. Every single employee from the host to the servers were great! Despite how busy they were, the service was fast and friendly and anytime we MIGHT need something,  the servers were checking on us. The food was excellent, it was fork-tender and full of smoky goodness. Turkey was the daily special, and a good smoked turkey is my weakness. Unfortunately, the turkey was sold out so we will have to come back another day for turkey.  I did buy a people size shirt on this trip, but on the way out I saw a stuffed black dog wearing a shirt. I will have to look into a dog-sized shirt along with turkey next time I'm in town.",1
5845,"My wife has never been here before and she loved every bite. I tried the gumbo for the first time and I was impressed. Growing up in Louisiana there’s not many places around here that do it the same but Black Dog didn’t disappoint. The catfish, the chicken, green beans, vinegar slaw, fries, and the sauces👌🏽 I will say, in my opinion, I usually go for the pulled chicken over bone-in and the bone-in is far better. Overall a great atmosphere and really good eats.",1
5846,It was good food we just prefer a sweeter BBQ sauce. We had a great waiter who took excellent care of us. We ate outside which was nice. You can bring your dog if you would like if you are eating outside which is always fun to do.,1
5847,"First time visiting Black Dog Smoke and Ale House on an out of town trip from the Chicago area down to Champaign.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance, and the service was excellent:: prompt seating, quick service, and very friendly.

For appetizers, I ordered a garden salad with a tasty creole vinaigrette dressing, and also the daily special of smoked chicken and andouille sausage gumbo, which was served hot and had a nice heat kick.  The andouille sausage was little bland, but it was still a decent gumbo.

For the main course, I ordered a two meat platter consisting of sliced brisket from the flat (lean), and also burnt ends from the (fattier) point meat.  My two sides choices were the pit beans and the twice baked potato casserole.  My two sauce choices were the Texas Red and the Georgia Peach.

The sides were decent, but not outstanding.  The pit beans were tasty and smoky with nice chunks of meat, but were barely lukewarm when served. The twice baked potato casserole was served hot and was also tasty, but it was a very small portion size, served in an aluminum muffin tin.

A single review will not accurately give any establishment an accurate account of their full menu, as I did not try many of their other meat selections or sides, so take my comments with a grain of salt...

I am a self proclaimed BBQ aficionado, an avid smoker of meat, and I like to visit top rated local BBQ establishments throughout my travels locally in Illinois, as well as to other states...

As BBQ styles and tastes vary so much regionally, personal preferences can impact one's opinion of the quality of the food they are eating.

That being said, my gold standard for every BBQ establishment I visit is always centered around the main course, and I always go for the most challenging meat any pit master knows there is to smoke, which is typically beef brisket...

I asked my server what type of wood Black Dog uses to smoke their meats, and also what type of smoker they use.  She promptly replied that they used cherrywood, and she was unsure about the smoker, but came back shortly thereafter with a framed diagram of Black Dog's wood fired rotisserie smoker that is used outside to smoke their meats.

My evaluation of their brisket is that is decent, but not great.  Nice bark and smoke ring on the point and flat, but the flavor was not there for me. The meat was smoky, but cherrywood is a sweeter and softer profile than my pallette is used to, which is Texas style BBQ smoked over post oak or mesquite, with a peppery kick.  I definitely preferred the point meat, which was warm and moist, over the flat, which was right on the borderline of moist/dry, and also not warm and fresh.  The bend/pull test on the flat was a C-, which barely passed.

As I continue to write occasional reviews locally, this is common for higher rated BBQ establishments in the midwest that are open from 11am until 8 or 9pm.

What that means to me, is that there is a reason why certain top BBQ establishments in Texas are only open as little as one to a few days a week, and also only open until the meat sells out...  That being said, I am still on the journey to find a local BBQ establishment that can wow me with a fresh, moist brisket...

The only real dissapointments I had were the barbecue sauces, which if you are a true barbecue connoisseur, should not matter...

As Aaron Franklin has stated, good barbecue does not need bbq sauce.

The Texas Red and the Georgia Peach were probably two of the least favorite BBQ sauces I have had.  Very pureed, and somewhat watery texture, and also lacking any pop of flavor profile

In closing, this is probably one of the better BBQ establishments in the Champaign-Urbana area, and in line with similar overall ratings of top BBQ establishments in the Greater Chicagoland area. I might have given a higher revue if I would have ordered ribs, pulled pork, chicken, or smoked wings, but when you compare the brisket to any establishment in the Texas Monthly Top 50. you might be disappointed.

Still worth a second visit...",1
5848,"This was our 326th 'cue stop across 35 states, and the 11th in Illinois.  We were seated around 7:30, and not surprisingly the brisket, burnt ends and daily special (gumbo) were already sold out.  So, $35 + tip got us 3 appetizers (cornbread, brisket queso, and 6 wings (3 flats and 3 drummies), as well as a pulled pork sandwich with tiny cups of coleslaw and the Lexington style sauce.  A side of fries accompanied the sandwich, and a refillable soft drink (Pepsi products) rounded out the order.  The wings and pulled pork both featured outstanding smoke, while both remained moist and tender.  The  glaze on the wings packed a fair amount of heat, and the pork was top-notch both wet and dry.  The brisket queso was interesting, and certainly deserves better than tortilla chips out of a store-bought bag.  Only the cornbread disappointed, being as bland as it was dry.  Looking forward to getting here early enough next time through town to sample the burnt ends.",1
5849,We had a fantastic dinner. The selection of sauces was excellent. The brisket queso dip was very good as were the rib tips.  Our server checked in with us frequently and provided excellent service. We will definitely be coming back.,1
5850,"This BBQ is spot on! 😎👍
Brisket is well cooked (could be a touch more moist) but finally someone who knows how to do sauce. The Texas sauce complements but does not overpower and has a nice afterburn 🤗
The potato salad is a little weak but if you mix in the excellent cole slaw it comes together well.
Finally the lemonade is clearly the product of lemons and sugar as God intended 😉👍",1
5851,"This was my first experience. Service was phenomenal, rib tips, red slaw and pit beans were very unique and delicious.  Menu offers a very nice variety which encourages my return.",1
5852,The blooming tea was a very refreshing drink to go with the rib tips! The food was delicious,1
5853,"I have eaten here quite a bit. The first time I went I was not impressed, I ordered the brisket and it was just okay. But, I ordered the baby back ribs and the smoked chicken wings are excellent! Even the ranch dressing and fries are probably the best I've ever had. The smoked wings and ribs are the best I've ever had (highly recommend these items). The Carolina red sauce is also fire. The service is also great!",1
5854,Delicious food and friendly staff. Food was a bit pricey but I understand that costs have gone up. They also use more eco friendly one-use items so the costs seem more justified. Must try!,1
5855,"It's been 3 years since I visited the Urbana area and when coming back I wanted to be sure to visit an old favorite restaurant. It was just like I remembered: great food, delicious sweet tea and excellent atmosphere. They only seat your group when your whole party is present so try to arrive together. The building is a former train station and it's been fully remodeled inside for the restaurant. The food is BBQ style so you can pick whatever you like, ribs, pulled pork, chicken, etc. And the sides are amazing too. I love getting the cornbread and pulled pork.",1
5856,"Went here for lunch today. Got the rib tips platter. It was amazing. Great taste, great value. Meal cost about $15. The ribs were smoked and seasoned to perfection and were just the right tenderness. The sides were amazing as well. I had green beans and baked beans. The sauces were great as well. I got chipotle and I don’t remember the second one. As a bonus, they allow pets on the patio, so my dog was able to sit with us and enjoy the meal. He even had a water bowl provided by the restaurant. Everything was great, and I would most definitely return here, if I lived in the area.",1
5857,"Cannot say enough good things! Absolutely loved every entree, every side, every sauce! This place is beyond worth the trip... and the staff is amazing!!! Burnt ends and the brisket for the win!!!",1
5858,The patio was nice and clean. The ribs were delicious. Loved the bbq sauces; Georgia Peach and Carolina Red. The sides were yummy too. The mac was creamy and I enjoyed the elote (served cold btw). I loved my salad. I wish I could remember the dressing which was recommended by the server. It was soooo good!!,1
5859,"We were visiting the area and checked the reviews and this place seems great.  We arrived and had to wait 10-15 mins because it was busy, we took this as a good sign.  We ordered drinks and the chips and salsa before our food, the smoked salsa was very good so we were excited for the meal.  The meal arrived and the excitement quickly changed to disappointment.  The brisket was very dry and the sauces were straight vinegar,  we had 6 in our party and none of us were happy with our meal.  The staff was great but the meal was below par and a few of us had upset stomachs the rest of the night.  I would not recommend.",0
5860,We all loved our food.  I had the rib tips with the mustard bbq sauce and it was perfection.  The sweet potato fries were really crispy and salty.  The server was personable and helpful.  The prices were super affordable.  Can’t recommend this place enough.,1
5861,Insanely good food! The many different sauce choices are all amazing and the meats are incredible. Definitely better than any other place that offers BBQ around. Outside dining area is great on warm breezy days.,1
5862,"The food and experience was overall good! The cornbread, sweet potato fries, and potato salad were PHENOMENAL. I gave it 4 stars only because the rest of the meal (meat, coslaw) were subpar and the mac and cheese was bland. The staff was friendly and our waitress was great! I would also recommend to save the $ and just do a sandwich plate versus the platter. What I really liked about my experience was that you could order a flight of their BBQ sauces. My favorites were the Texas BBQ and the Habanero BBQ.",1
5863,"Quality worsen a lot.
Ribs taste like rubber.
Sweet potato fries and mac n cheese taste good tho.",0
5864,We went for lunch and it was a late lunch around 1:42 in the afternoon and this place was already out of their famous burnt ends. I mean it's like Kentucky Fried Chicken being out of chicken. If you know you run out of something that means everybody buys it so why not jack up the price and have a ton of it there's a business model for you. My brisket was subpar I asked for the fattiest pieces and if you enlarge the picture you can see very little fat on it granted they weren't as lean as my wife's plate which is not picture here. The pinto beans were great but the green beans and tomatoes we're not my cup of tea. I would go back if they had burn in but God knows when they would if they're out by 1 in the afternoon on a Friday. The price was too much I have to settle for not getting what I really wanted.,0
5865,"So good and satisfying, different taste but good and addictive. The cornbread muffins were nothing like I have ever had and I want more lol... I don't even like cornbread but loved theirs. Not a fan of smoked flavors but again LOVED theirs. The meat was tender tasty and sauces were good and not the usual. We will be back for sure. Not cheap but it's quality, not large on portions however filling. The slaw and greenbeans were plain though not a deal breaker (we didn't come for that) maybe they have better sides to try. Highly recommend this place!",1
5866,"It's fine. Small portions relative to high prices, good but not great meat, average sides.

Good chance that the best menu items will be sold out if you don't arrive early (to be fair that's pretty normal for barbecue, but still annoying).",1
5867,"Service was phenomenal! Love our hostess. Parking can get tough because this place is so good a lot of people go here. We managed to find parking thankfully. It’s a big restaurant with its own private parking lot. They even have jambalaya here and I hear it’s good from someone at my table. I ordered pulled pork with Georgia peach bbq sauce. I thought the bbq sauce was good, but I did hope it would be a bit sweeter. The place looks clean and food came out fairly fast. No issues checking out. Our hostess went over and beyond her call of duty today and I’m extremely grateful.",1
5868,"One of the most famous restaurants in the city, so you will have to wait for a table. I like the Combo platters since you can get 2-3 types of meats. But some days you just want some small they have an option with only one type of meat. They have a nice variety of sauces and drinks. The staff is very friendly and helpful.",1
5869,"Delicious!!! Served family style. Free range chicken so juicy and flavor full. Beef brisket with hot and smoke sauce or even habanero bbq sauce, best. Elote here are so good. Don't forget try the sausage. Alcohol here are so inexpensive. Love this place already.",1
5870,Some of their BBQ is really good and some is average. The biggest let down is their side dishes. They have a few that are alright like the twice baked potato casserole. Their coleslaw is just not good. Its chopped so its hard to eat without a spoon and its extremely vinegar forward. Its the one side I'd suggest steering clear of.,1
5871,"Portions are a bit slim. No kids’ meals (understandable for an ale house, but limited our experience).

Meat was exquisite (I had burnt ends but got good reviews on the smoked salmon at our table).

Interesting attempt to capture bbq from several US regions. For example, you can choose from Alabama white sauce, Georgia peach bbq sauce, Carolina-style, etc. It’s a great concept and pretty well executed. Similarly, there are several kinds of slaw available (not all suited me).

Service was good, seating options were diverse even in the rain, and the old train station vibe is matched by the active train track beside it.",1
5872,"A must go if you like beef brisket. The brisket just melts in your mouth and the bun is one of the finest I've ever had. Sweet potato fries are a great compliment with the beef brisket sandwich as well..

Wonderful service, relaxed atmosphere, great food.

I would definitely recommend it 👍",1
5873,"Had the Cuban pork sandwich, which was very good, and filling. Nice atmosphere for a mid-week late hour lunch. I suspect it can get really busy on the weekends. Free parking too!",1
5874,"Everyone is efficient here in Balckdog. They take order soon after we sat in. And the meal served quickly after we ordered. All is good. The only thing to notice is that the line is long, 30 minutes wait over the weekend.",1
5875,Our son Michael took us here for lunch.  Terrific food.  We had brisket and polish sausage.  Go here!  Nice out of the way location. Good parking etc,1
5876,"They’re always out of burnt ends but brisket is second choice and always delicious. Wish they would serve with hot sauces (not bbq sauces). Cheap drinks. Great outdoor space, and friendly service!",1
5877,Pretty great meat products. 99% sure the mac and cheese was just Stouffer's. Great server. The patio that is mostly enclosed was great. Probably my favorite part about the experience. Dogs allowed on the patio.,1
5878,"Absolutely delicious. First time being here in a while, so glad to be back. I had the special, which was a brisket panini. The brisket was a bit overpowered by the other ingredients on the sandwich, but still fantastic. The Mac and cheese and elote were very good as well.",1
5879,"Service is amazing. Everyone is always friendly. The food is always delicious. I was able to finally try the burnt ends because they are always sold out when I go, and they did not disappoint! The brisket was soo buttery smooth, it practically melted in my mouth! I am a big fan of the platters that come with 2 sides and 2 sauces. That is such a great deal.",1
5880,Really enjoyed the BBQ. Good service and sides were good too. Ordered the platter with the sweet potato and green beans. It was delicious!,1
5881,"The service was great and the large space made it easy to follow distancing protocols. The food, however, was lacking.

We got three platters (as seen in the picture): burnt ends, pulled pork, and turkey. The burnt ends along with the sweet potato fries were perfect, literally no complaints. The pulled pork was relatively dry, but the sides were good. The turkey, however, was god awful. It was dry as a bone, and ruined the experience...It was so dry I drank 4 cups of water to just finish half of it. The sides were also terrible, with the Mac and cheese overcooked to the point of falling apart (although maybe some people like it this way). The coleslaw was also sickeningly sweet (surprising for a vinegar base slaw).

All in all, probably would not come back again.",1
5882,"A Champaign must-visit! Black Dog is one of the more popular restaurants in the area, and it’s definitely for a reason. This is not the first time I’ve been here, but I never got the chance to actually review the place. They have some great BBQ and specials that you can never go wrong with. I always get the Combo platters since I can never decide on one thing, but I highly recommend their pulled pork and burnt ends. Great service and great food if you are in town!",1
5883,The burnt ends are amazing along with the Georgia Peach bbq sauce.   Prices are very reasonable and the wait staff was very friendly.  Definitely have to return when I make it back to the Champaign area.,1
5884,Amazing burnt end sandwich! Friendly and fast service. Will definitely be back on my next visit to UIUC. Wish you would add desserts to your menu as well,1
5885,Presentation is nice but most good was warm when it got to the table. Nothing like slimey room temperature catfish. Please seek help with the barbecue sauces as well,0
5886,"Great food, great service. The Salmon sandwich was excellent.",1
5887,"Always a sold choice. Good bbq, great beer and cool atmosphere. Service is always fast and friendly. Smoked chicken is fantastic.",1
5888,"Our family ordered the burnt ends, smoked catfish, jambalaya, and smoked salmon. Everything was delicious. One of the better restaurants in the area.",1
5889,"Awesome place, it is a must if you are in Champaign area. I really enjoyed the food and the server attention. Great BBQ style and good selection of beers. It is a small place so maybe during dinner time it could be full but your time in line will worth it.",1
5890,"Delicious BBQ, great local beers, friendly staff. The burnt ends are often sold out early and are a must try! Pulled pork and beef brisket are also excellent. Combo platters come with a choice of two sides and sauces. I highly recommend the corn bread and mac & cheese. The sauces all seem to be different with great flavors and texture. Pick your sauce according to heat level.  Atmosphere is vibrant and it can get a bit loud when it's packed.  You must come here if you visit Champaign IL!",1
5891,BEST meal I have EVER had. The burnt ends and salad are to die for! The employees are soooo down to earth and sweet!,1
5892,"Great service and super delicious food. I had an order of chili cheese fries, which were piled high with beef, and chicken and sausage gumbo, which was very flavorful.",1
5893,This is my all time favorite restaurant in Champaign. The rib tips are simply out of the world. All the other items are mind blowing as well. Never regretted ordering anything here!,1
5894,"Best brisket I have ever had .
Sweet Potato Fries were awesome.
Staff extremely understanding.",1
5895,"When a restaurant run’s out of a dish or two, either they didn’t order enough or it was just that good.  I’d like to think it was the latter.   I had the pork ribs and oh my, it was fall off the bone tender!
I would order it again.  The pit beans were okay, a little hard for my taste.   The twice baked potatoes were delicious as well.  Our waitress was great.
So our overall experience was great and when I’m back in the area, I’ll revisit Black Dog.
Please like if this review helps you to decide.",1
5896,"Delicious, it was the first time we had ever been to Black Dog! So good. The food was amazing really smoked meat, yummo!",1
5897,"Champaign location is open for indoor, outdoor, and pick-up.  Still the best damn Q in the area.

Enjoyed Beef Ribs, Smoked Polish, Chicken, Mashed Potato Casserole, corn bread, with Milo's Mustard and Texas BBQ sauces.  Finished off with a cold Polyanna's (Lemont, IL) Brown. Everything was fantastic!",1
5898,Amazing barbecue joint. Highly recommend the sauce flight. The twice baked potato casserole and corn bread are excellent sides. The pulled pork is outstanding and the pork ribs practicality melted in my mouth. I cannot wait to try burnt ends next time! Carolina Red sauce was so good I was stealing my daughter's fries to dip in it! Our server was super friendly!!,1
5899,"I've been to Black Dog several times before, so this review is more of what I ordered vs. the other items on the menu.

I ordered the Chicken salad sandwich with green beans on the side. The green beans were cooked with bacon and tomatoes; I personally did not enjoy them as much as I had hoped. The bread for the chicken salad sandwich was coated in butter, and made the sandwich a little too heavy.

Otherwise, standard Black Dog, as expected.  Overall a decent experience. Also, they have cocktails for reasonable prices, which I recommend.",1
5900,This BBQ joint has NO BUISNESS being this PHENOMENALLY DELICIOUS in the middle of Illinois. I've had BBQ all over this country and this DEFINITELY ranks in my top 3. The hot bbq sauce is amazing! All the food was juicy and smoked just right. Thank you all for a great experience from the food to the staff and management! I will be back!,1
5901,"Very nice place and waiters. Had the rib tips platter and the portion was so big I had to take the leftovers out. It was good too !
The atmosphere a very cozy and relaxing, nice place for a gathering with friends or a date. I definitely recommend !",1
5902,Pulled pork and turkey was awesome! Food and service is always great at a great price!,1
5903,"Delicious !  Every single thing is like wow. I was vegan before… well, not now haha. Ultimately, the service and the place is really good.",1
5904,Brisket as good as my own!! Sides and service also exceptional. I was able to sample the Burnt Ends which appear to be sliced off the point whereas the brisket is sliced off the flat. Both are exceptional,1
5905,Always great food.,1
5906,"Stumbled across Black Dog and I am so happy I did. Great food and better service, Joe D was on the ball. Love the potato casserole, pulled pork and smoked salmon.",1
5907,"Take a Train to Flavor Town!
This former train depot is my last stop on the Champaign BBQ trail.  And Im kicking myself ever since. If this was the first stop, the quest would have ended and I would have spent three days camping outside this establishment.
Cool venue, concrete bar, polite accommodating staff and ""to murder a live a cow for"" Brisket.
Best brisket in the midwest. I'll stand by that and possibly extent its bounds.
They tackle smoked wings with elegance and the forever elusive smoked salmon with grace.  But, ultimately the Brisket is the buy.  And seemingly the burnt ends, which ran out twice in our visit.
A note on sides, a smoked sweet potato may change your opinion of this super food. If your child won't eat green beans just give them the Black Dog Beans and force him/her to take a bite and watch them contradict themselves at the table.
Go here.  Move in if they'll let you.",1
5908,I highly recommend this place as all the food is really good. The brisket chili is exceptional as is the combo platter of which you can choose which two meats and two BBQ sauces you want. I had brisket and pork ribs with Hot Georgia Peach and Carolina Red BBQ sauces. Sources are on the side and the smoked meat is so good that it doesnt need sauce but the souces compliment the meat flavors. One word: FANTISTIC!,1
5909,Very clean and friendly! Meat was extremely tender and juicy! I had the beef tips and brisket! AMAZING!!!,1
5910,"Your visit to Champaign is not complete until you visit the Black Dig Smoke & Ale House (and no, I am not paid for this endorsement)!

The best barbeque you'll find in town!  I tried a sampler platter with both spare ribs and chicken - and it was AMAZING!  Perfectly grilled with fall-off-the-bone meats and expertly seasoned!

There are a wide variety of sauces with different ""heat"" levels.  If you like milder sauce, I recommend the ""Georgia"" or ""Texas"" versions.  These are a little sweeter and won't ""burn"" your mouth.  The Texas sauce is a touch hotter than the Georgia, but still very good.

Staff is courteous and friendly - I even got to meet the manager and tell him what a great job they are doing!

There are also many local or regional beers available, as well as the National brands.",1
5911,Meat was good. The BBQ dinner salad was the size of a normal side salad. Bbq sauces were not good at all. Service was friendly. I would not go back. Overall it was a letdown.,1
5912,"I love the spare rib here, it's probably the best in town.",1
5913,Great place! Best pulled pork ever. Love the sauce choices.,1
5914,"AMAZING.. Best beef ribs I have ever tasted..! It’s now becoming a tradition to visit Black Dog whenever I am in town.
Also, their brisket is spectacular and highly recommended.",1
5915,Good BBQ but wasn’t wowed. I got the brisket sandwich with Mac & cheese and cornbread. Cornbread was the better of the 2 sides. Nice sauce selection. I also had a light lager beer.,1
5916,Nice array of BBQ sauce to try. If you like spicy things this place has good options. Their burnt ends are really really good!,1
5917,"Good food and drink, good wait staff. Poor organization and communication for customer flow, ordering, and parking need to be reconsidered.",1
5918,"GO EARLY SO YOU DONT MISS OUT.

Amazing food and set in an old train station.  But go early at 6:15 they were sold out of Pork Ribs and Tips.  Amazing selection of beer on menu and some cask special selections.

When you walk in, sign the board to get a table.  They seat off that list and not",1
5919,Very good. I like sweeter Cole slaw but everything was great. Very busy and great service.,1
5920,"Food was delicious. You get to select 1-2 sauces with your meal, & I wasn't a fan of the two sauces I tried (very vinegar-ey), but could be I just picked the ""wrong"" ones.",1
5921,"I have had the BBQ before #Excellent. This visit was #TOGO. The menu meets every need from light apps, hearty sandwiches and belly busting platters all served with fair portioned sides. The #BBQ sauces are amazing(I suggest the Hot Georgia Peach)Pair all this with a #Killer beer & #Cocktail list, over 50 whiskeys and a polite wine list. You'll have a wonderful experience....every time.",1
5922,"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere. When they told me “best BBQ in IL” I don’t think they were wrong",1
5923,Bad drinks (waitress apologized even before serving us).  Fatty meat and small servings. Too bad...this was once a very good restaurant. One owner is a penny pincher and losing business. Sorry guys. Made suggestions to no avail.,0
5924,"I had a very meh experience. Our server was very slow. And my baby back ribs (on the specials board) were pretty dry. (The sweet potato fries were pretty good.) My friends kept saying how good it was, so maybe it was just an off day? I didn't see anything too special on the menu. By 1 PM on a Sat they were out of turkey, burnt ends, and green beans. So I don't know if they just don't have as much as they should or if they're that good that they just run out early.  I just felt mediocre about the whole lunch experience.",0
5925,"Didn’t make it in time for the burnt ends and was a little disappointed. However, if you’re ever in the same situation, just order the beef brisket...essentially the same thing just leaner.",1
5926,"Food was good, the brisket was dry, I was expecting a really juicy brisket but the flavor and taste was good, I like they offer the option of different sauce and they bring it separately. Chips and Salsa surprised me because was really a fried tortilla make it chips. I would come back for sure, then only reason I gave them 4 starts was becaus they didn't have the beer I asked originally.",1
5927,We ate here and you really get your money’s worth. The staff was very helpful! I would highly recommend!,1
5928,This barbecue equals or exceeds the standards we've found at the best bbq joints in the south. And the sides are a treat in themselves.,1
5929,"Highlights were their brisket and peach bellini (even though it came from a can). My biggest disappointment was the mac n cheese. It had zero flavor, even after adding salt and pepper. I feel like every great BBQ joint needs to have great mac n cheese!",1
5930,Shared a 3 choice platter. Everything was delicious. Mac n cheese and twice baked potato sides were both delicious too. Sauce on the side was nice because the meat was well flavored on its own. Service was great and fast too!,1
5931,Had the impossible burger - could have been seasoned better. The esquites was delicious & the margarita was refreshing!,1
5932,"I have ordered Thanksgiving turkeys for at least the last 5 years--this year, I tried to order and by 8:30 am they were sold out--very disappointing",0
5933,"Beef 🐮 Brisket is the Glory 🍖
Beef 🐄  rib too 😋
You've got to get up here 😋!!
You have to come hungry!!!",1
5934,"Came in with a group of 18 people and the people working were courteous and friendly. The food came out much faster than I'd have expected for such a large group with so many orders. Delicious BBQ sauce and burnt ends! (I didn't catch her name but the waitress with blue eyes, a nose ring, and curly hair helped us and she was great!)",1
5935,Super cool environment. Food was really good! And the waiter was so nice. I accidentally oversold how much spice I could handle and he brought me a couple to try so I can feel it out and get what I like. Would totally suggest to anyone.,1
5936,"I really enjoyed the black dog smoke and ale house for lunch. The portions were perfect size, not too much. The burnt ends brisket sandwich was perfect and the sauces were delicious. Good value for the money too.  I can't wait to come back",1
5937,"Two sandwiches, burnt ends and cubian, both excellent.  Sides were different from standard fair, coleslaw and twice baked casserole.  Very good. Nice varied beer and drink menu.  We were there at 2, not many people,  excellent service.  Will go back next time in town.",1
5938,Our drinks arrived with our food. Three out of four mixed drinks were so bad we didn't drink them. Service was less than friendly. Way over priced.,0
5939,"Pork wings, ribs, and beans! All were fantastic. Some of the best BBQ I have had in Illinois. Get there early if you want brisket... they run out.",1
5940,"Unfortunately the brisket was dry. Luckily, the sauces were delicious, and I needed them to even attempt to swallow. The kitchen was so fast that the food came out before the drinks.",0
5941,"We tried the special ribs and also a a dinner plate of chicken. Both were delicious and the service was friendly and attentive.  Are good was promptly brought to our table and we also enjoyed the atmosphere. However, I was surprised to learn after ordering 4 ribs that I paid $39.98 for 4 ribs or basically $10 per rib. They were big and tasty, but I wouldn’t order them again unless they were on sale.",1
5942,"Might be the only good BBQ in town, if we're being honest here. Staff are super nice. Love the use of the Square care readers at the table, rather than taking cards off somewhere else when its time to pay the tab.",1
5943,"Service is good, sides are delicious. I love the baked potato salad. Brisket was dry and burnt ends were really fatty, need trimmed better before smoking. I love seeing a beautifulsmoke ring on the meat. Portions are small for the amount you pay. Beef ribs tasted amazing, but it was a battle trying to get the meat off the bone. High price for decent BBQ, mix the hot Georgia peach and the regular for a balanced sweet heat.",1
5944,"The barbecue here is OK. It could be a little more flavorful. I had the Hot Georgia Peach sauce, which was listed as hot, but it wasn’t really that hot.  It’s a pretty busy place, so I felt that the waitress was trying to rush me out, so it’s not a place to go to relax.",1
5945,"Nice restaurant in a remodeled train station. Great ambiance. Good beer selection, mixed drinks? Meh.. (the spicy raspberry Margarita should be rename the tobasco raspberry margarita) Other than that,  pretty good BBQ. Nice experience.",1
5946,"The best bbq I ever had. Been to TX, TN, MS, KC MO and I live in St Louis area. Not only are the meats perfectly smoked and tender, they make their own sauces. I recommend burnt ends (they run out each day) and hot Georgia peach sauce! Mmm mmm.",1
5947,The smoked pork ribs here is loaded with goodness of the intense smoked flavour. The chicken wings were gob smackingly delicious! A must try and you'll surely want to head back for another round. It's the best in the city.,1
5948,"My husband and I love this place.
BBQ for any palette and plenty of sides to choose from
The brisket is phenomenal and we do enjoy their beer selection
Seriously, everything is sooo good—especially the corn bread!",1
5949,"Didn't get a chance to try any ale but the smoke was amazing. Had the burnt ends, my favorite bbq joint menu item, and they were perfect. Great flavor, a nice bark, and super tender. Went with the hot Georgia peach bbq sauce (there's a mild version also) and was not disappointed. Delicious and the spiciness was right in the middle of the range I like,, so perfect for a casual meal while drinking some beers. Though I didn't get to partake in the beer there's a level of spice where beer and spice are not enjoyable together. Looking forward to going back for the full experience.",1
5950,"Delicious American BBQ food, washed down with a lovely iced tea. This second, bigger location is well worth a visit. You'll be well looked after by the friendly and helpful staff.",1
5951,"Best BBQ in the Area, we were not disappointed one bit!
The service was fast friendly and they were very knowledgeable regarding their menu.
We we're looking for a good place to eat and was recommended by a friend that this is by far the best BBQ",1
5952,"I'm from Texas, so I may be biased... The food was ok, brisket was a little dry.. pulled pork wasn't really pulled it was strips..corn bread and polish sausage were on point though! They were out of multiple options when we arrived.. also no kids menu.",1
5953,"Came from out of town, excellent food awesome services. Super friendly people, and my boss bought a shirt there. Definitely recommend going for lunch/dinner.",1
5954,One of the best BBQ places in the world. Have good chips with bean dip and the burnt ends are probably the best I've had. Only issue is that the pace can get quite busy at times and they run out of burnt ends quickly.,1
5955,"Delicious BBQ, highly recommend the burnt ends and I am a man who knows his burnt ends. Elotes and smoked sweet potato perfect compliment.",1
5956,"Awesome atmosphere, great taste, good sized portions A+++",1
5957,"Good service, nice selection of beers, the BBQ was good, will visit again.",1
5958,Amazing burnt ends every time. Consistently tasty with good portions.,1
5959,Awesome brisket! Georgia Peach sauce was good too. I will always make an effort to stop here when I am in town.,1
5960,Had the smoked catfish. Best catfish I have ever had.  Never disappointed with the food or the service.,1
5961,Food was good. The place has a nice atmosphere. I was there for a business dinner. The only thing I would say negatively is the sign saying 60 minute time limit. A business dinner can go for a couple hours. Sometimes people want to enjoy a long dinner followed by drinks. It leaves the customer feeling like they need to rush. 🤷‍♀️,1
5962,Best of Champaign and Central Illinois. The location in downtown Champaign is located at and old railroad waiting area by the abandoned tracks. There is a nice bar too. Right next to downtown and same great barbecue as the Urbana location.,1
5963,Had a little exploring to do to find it. In a old train station beside the tracks. Exquisitely redone station. Staff was friendly and attentive. Good food. Not the best i ever had but if in town would definitely go back.,1
5964,Food is pretty good. Only been once but great service also,1
5965,"I'm leaving this review after my second visit.
This is genuinely one of my new favorite restaurants, I first went with my roommate then took my dad out to lunch here. The meats are delicious, the sauces are savory, and the service is perfect. The staff is very well accustomed to being busy and when I had eaten with my father I merely made a small gesture to my waitor for refills and he perfectly understood me. I'll definitely be going again. Thank you for reading ✌",1
5966,"Man this place is awesome. I ate here on 3 different occasions and was satisfied each time. I've tried the salmon sandwich, the burnt ends sandwhich, and the hot polish sausage sandwich. Customer service was awesome.",1
5967,Great bbq spot in downtown Champaign IL!,1
5968,"We just randomly ordered food, everything turns out perfect. Waiting is a little bit long but it's worthwhile. Such a pity that burnt ends are sold out.",1
5969,Pretty super lunch with family. My wife's burnt ends were fabulous. The dry smoked wings were great. Kids loved the Mac and cheese with their entrees. Probably only get wings and brisket from here on out.,1
5970,"Food was great!! Staff was excellent!

We didn't realize there was two locations, and now I've been to both!

Both locations are superb!!!",1
5971,Had an amazing pineapple pepper margarita and great food. They are working hard to make sure you feel safe with everything going on.,1
5972,"Came through for a solid anniversary lunch with my wife from Bloomington, nearby. Thankfully ce by before their Friday lunch rush and the Burnt Crisp Sandwich and Fries were on point and the hot Georgia peach BBQ sauce was the perfect touch. Servers were all working extremely well with one another. Efficient and smooth and best of all, personable. Cheers and thank you!",1
5973,"We ate here based on the outstanding reviews.  Sorry to say it was a miss for the whole family.  I understand brisket should have a good deal of fat, but the majority of my burnt ends sandwich was fat.  Only a tiny bit had the actual bark of the burnt end.  Nobody else in the family was impressed with their good.  Service was fine.  Seating in the greenhouse is a tight squeeze.",1
5974,Always a good spot without fail.,1
5975,"The food is ok, nothing extraordinary! the restaurant is beautiful, the people are really nice and polite",1
5976,"Wow this place needs more signage. It's in an old train station and our GPS couldn't even find it. We were told about it from a friend and he gave us good directions so we were able to find it but if we didn't know, we wouldn't have. Anyway, once we found it, we had some amazing barbecue. Very casual place with a great decor. Menu was basic smoked meats and sides so we ordered brisket, beans and mac and cheese. Delicious. We were thrilled with how good it was. Server was SO friendly and courteous. We had a great time during our visit. They just need more signs. Lol.",1
5977,"Was not bothered by the wait. We expected it to be busy, no problem. The mood of the place however was unfortunate. The host was cold. Our waitress didn't say a single word to us between food order and check. Unfriendly. Just sucks when your excited about trying such a popular place.

The food is pretty good, luckily. And brought fast. That was nice. If you're traveling through the state and passing Champagne you'll find better places for sure.",0
5978,"Checked this place out during a work visit.  Service was good, place was clean. Unfortunately, the food was absolutely lacking any flavor. I ordered the pulled pork and mac and cheese. Both had zero spices added to it. And there's no way it was smoked because there wasn't any smoke flavor. The mac and cheese had the texture it gets when it sits out for a while. My coworker ordered the brisket and twice baked casserole. Same thing - no flavor. I asked for a dessert menu afterwards, but unfortunately they don't have any. Just not impressed.",0
5979,"Food was good nothing special. Had the combo pick two, it was about $20 a little pricey. Service sice is average. Had spare ribs and brisket was impressed with both. Had the bake beans which were very good, green beans I wouldn't recommend. I was disappointed with the 2 sauces I picked and the 2 my wife had. Had an scan code to order a drink while waiting that you paid for on your phone and the host brings it out.",1
5980,"Good bbq, the “hot” chipotle sauce wasn’t. The meat and sides were good.",1
5981,"Oh my! The building is so cute and the meat and sides were FABULOUS!!!!
We even took more home to have later! We would recommend 100%. The staff were also so friendly and helpful!!! We will be back!!!
The Northerner folk",1
5982,Tried a new place tonight...Black Dog! Delicious! Food was great! Service was even better(Cory & Paula)! I should have asked if the name was a Led-Zeppelin reference...🤔,1
5983,Awesome place great service with good drink menu average food,1
5984,Love the pulled pork with hot Georgia peach sauce. Real nice outside eating section,1
5985,Great ribs and sides. They make their own BBQ sauces. Go when they open for no waiting.,1
5986,Brisket?  Check.  Burnt ends?  Check.  My stomach aches I ate so much... But the pain is worth it.  Best BBQ in the country.,1
5987,"An old favorite that always delivers. The burnt ends are the reason to show up (and if you don’t know, now you know!!!), but the hits just keep on coming. The cornbread is great, the twice-baked casserole is low-key amazing (think mashed potatoes but twice as good), and I might sell a kidney for a hot polish with some pulled chicken. My sauces are the Carolina Red and Mustard, but that’s just me.",1
5988,"Ordered a full rack of spare ribs. They and all sides were fabulous as is par for the food at Black Dog. Eat here as many times as you can, you won't regret it!",1
5989,"Ordered curbside mid afternoon. Burnt ends and daily special were already out, apparently second batch becomes available at 5 pm. Pulled pork platter with smoked sweet potato and summer slaw was fantastic. Could only eat half, portions larger than they look. My husband had pulled rib sandwich with slaw. Not a typo; he loved it.",1
5990,I like that you can order a beverage while you're waiting for your table and they bring it out to you. Their meat is always cooked well and their sauces are quite tasty. We have always had positive experiences with the staff,1
5991,One of my favorite places for great barbecue.,1
5992,"A bit hard to find, but don't give up it's well worth the extra time to find! When maps says turn right here, do it... it looks like you're pulling into an alley (You're actually at the back of the building) Just drive around the building to the other side... The brisket beef queso was the bomb! Both our meals were very good (beef brisket & smoked catfish), service was helpful & friendly. The restaurant was very clean. Can't wait to go back👍",1
5993,Burnt ends are amazing! Staff is friendly and service is normally quick! Every time I eat there the food is amazing! They mix very tasty drinks as well!,1
5994,"Stopped here while traveling for work, Food was great, tasty sauces, good service, nice drink selection, I'll be back next time I'm through.",1
5995,Great food and service. The burnt tip queso was great.,1
5996,"Updated review. Decided to give this restaurant a second try. Service was good. The food was average too below average. Won't be back for a 3rd time.
Went here for dinner on a Tuesday night. They have a nice outdoor seating area. The waitress we had was unfriendly and seemed to have very little knowledge about the menue and what items the were out of. The food we got was good for the most part. The mac and cheese was very plain, the burnt ends were ok (not what I'm use to for burnt ends) they were more just fatty brisket strips. The best item we got was the beef ribs. They were good and had alot of meet on them.",0
5997,Delicious brisket with sweet potato fries. Great service.,1
5998,"Best BBQ in town, they never miss & they are always friendly.",1
5999,good BBQ,1
6000,"Arguably the best BBQ in the county. I know BBQ is a topic of debate for many, but black dog has earned its status because it truly has some good BBQ. It's one of the few BBQ joints in town that I can say everything has been generously smoked every time. Nothing is more frustrating than craving a good smoky meal and getting something that doesn't taste smoked at all. This place has delivered pretty consistently, and that's very hard to do with BBQ. The only drawback to this place is the quantity to cost ratio. I'd argue it's a little pricey for Champaign, but this quality in a bigger city is evenly priced. Overall it gets a five star from me because I appreciate their commitment to good food and the service has always been good to me.",1
6001,"Honestly food is AMAZING!!! but our waitress that we got tonight absolutely ignored us. As well as cutting me off when I was ordering. I also had to ask another waitress for a refill of our drinks? It wasn’t her table but she kindly helped us. Our waitress helped a table right behind us diligently. We would understand that they were busy… and she couldn’t get to us right away. But she SURE made time for the customers behind us. Also we waited for the check for awhile, don’t know what we did to be ignored the whole time either. Lady was a older with blonde curly hair, glasses, I kindly advise management to talk to her about how she should handle all future customers.",1
6002,The outdoor seating is nice & I rate their sweet potato fries a 5/5! I do wish they had a more diverse menu.,1
6003,Very good. Burnt toss were awesome. Queso with brisket and homemade chips. Reasonably priced too!,1
6004,"Best BBQ spot in the world! Used to go several times a week, now that I live 800+ miles away it is a must stop on a trip through the midwest. You gotta try the burnt ends, wings, catfish tacos and brisket!",1
6005,A little hard to find but pretty good. Good beer selection and good food. We had the burnt ends. They were good. And the pork ribs. Good service and good food.,1
6006,I was disappointed in our meal. 1st I placed my order to go. Waited in my car for over 1/2 hour. Went up to see if it was ready yet and server went to find my order. Came back and apologized for them not bringing it out to me. Got home and the meat was fatty and tough. Wasn't a good first time impression. Did like the sauce,1
6007,"I'm not a fan of BBQ, and I get didn't have any meat on the menu that wasn't BBQ.  I had Texas Caviar with chips and baked potato casserole.  Both were excellent!  Our waitperson, Zack, was very good, prompt and attentive at the right level.",1
6008,"The food looked good and the portion seems OK although it is pricey. However, I got sick after I ate salmon in this place. Two hours after eating the food, I had to go to the restroom so badly with stomach ache :( .  I won't order (salmon) from them again. There was something wrong with the food.",0
6009,Definitely not the best bbq in the area. Everything I had was bland and the sauces tasted off. Only pros are that the food came fast and the atmosphere was nice,0
6010,"Service was not very attentive, BBQ sandwich was barely warm. Brisket was good, and BBQ sauce was good. Would have been a lot better hot. Very pricey, for what you get. $18 for a plate of BBQ brisket?!",1
6011,"They do know their meat and smoking and the place is busy as soon as it is open for a reason.
Probably best need chili ever (is was all about substance and not filter), somewhat unfortunate that this excellent dish was served nearly cold, which loses great deal of it's taste.",1
6012,"Food was just ok.  Not even warm.  Smallest side of fries I've ever had..
and I'm old...price not commensurate with portion or quality.  Service was negligible.  Waitress took orders, never got my drink; had to ask server who delivered our food, and had to find our own straws.  Never saw the waitress again until she asked if we were ready for check, at which time she asked if we wanted more water.  (We were drinking iced tea, and beer).  My significant other is a stickler for drink refills.  As in, you keep his drinks refilled, you'll get a sizeable tip!  He had one beer.   Needless to say, tip was as missing as our service.",0
6013,"The Chipotle sauce was delicious,  and the chicken was super tender.",1
6014,First time here. Amazing BBQ. We had the chicken and brisket. Delicious. Mac and Cheese wasn’t to my taste but my hubby loved it. I did love the batter fries though. And the homemade BBQ sauces and white sauce on the sandwich I got were excellent. This is a place everyone who stops into town needs to eat at!,1
6015,"ALL the food was exceptional! I had the beef brisket sandwich with twice baked potatoes and broccoli. Other members of our group had burnt ends, the salmon, pulled pork, chicken etc. Everyone was satisfied and happy with their selection! A variety of BBQ sauces available too. The service was also outstanding! They do sit you down only when your whole party is there, so plan accordingly or you’ll have to wait",1
6016,"Very good BBQ place. I believe our server was Joe, and he was very friendly and polite. Our food arrived extremely fast, in less than 10 minutes. The baby back ribs were kind of dry but they still tasted very good.",1
6017,"Disappointing portions all super small.
Pulled pork, brisket, Impossible burger even sides Coleslaw and mac & cheese average At best! And the hostess is a ball buster. No thanks should’ve gone somewhere else. Truly was a waste of time. Server nice.",0
6018,"Great food and wonderful service, too! The baked potato casserole was delicious!",1
6019,"Black Dog is always a hit with out of towners. Good drink selection. I personally have trouble finding a side I enjoy and think the sauces are pretty run of the mill. I always enjoy excellent service while there and the food is solid, but I believe this restaurant may be slightly overrated.",1
6020,"Favorite BBQ spot in C-U. Ribs are my go to order. Don't order the brisket. Although delicious, the portion sizes are a bit on the small side.",1
6021,"The food was good. Just as expected for a BBQ place. Some things were a little different. Like their version of ""burnt ends"" was slice brisket that was a little more well done on the edges. Not what I expected, but it wasn't bad.

The service was the issue. Less than exceptional. When our waiter did make it over to our table, which was maybe 3 times during our entire meal, he was so quiet you couldn't understand him. It really seemed like he hated his job and didn't want to be there. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but restaurant service isn't for everyone and I'd encourage this established to hire folks that actually pretend to enjoy service their customers.",1
6022,Great bbq. Food comes quick. Everything we’ve had has been delicious.,1
6023,best BBQ in town,1
6024,"Wow, great food and service. Huge choice of local beers. Very reasonable $$. Cubano and Chili, corn muffins are great. Server was Jay, very nice and professional.",1
6025,"Was surprised to only give this 1 star. They don't really offer anything for small children hot dogs, chicken nuggets etc. After we seen all the great reviews we thought it was gonna be a great dinner. We ordered our food and appetizers and they brought out apps first and then few minutes later our dinner. I don't like when we are rushed to finish appetizers because meals been served. Felt rushed the entire time we ate. Due to covid I'm sure. But the food wasn't any better when dinner came Mac and cheese was dried out and so was the brisket. When the waiter asked how it was I told them and they said sorry. Guess that made it all better.",0
6026,"The food was delicious everytime I've been there. It's a drive for us, so it's a special treat.

We went to celebrate my birthday and we aren't accustomed to add strict of mask mandates. The staff were out right rude when someone walked in without a mask. Our waiter was also rude when we didn't put our masks on immediately when he came to our table. He even threw the draws/silverware on our table in an attempt to get away from us.

The seating was atrocious as well. With all of the table closed for"" social distancing"", they tried to cram my family of 8 into a small table for 4 in the very back of the restaurant.

I think it will be some time before I return, which is sad because I do thoroughly enjoy the food!",0
6027,"Best BBQ in town. Go if you like smoked, high quality meat. Sauces on the side. Sweet potato is amazing, twice baked casserole is the number one side dish. Number one meat would be burnt ends (runs out often). Lunch and specials were great too.",1
6028,"First off, taste is excellent and quality is good.  Biggest disappointment was that a platter with 3 meats is not as much food as just ordering a sandwich.  2 pieces of ""burnt ends"" which was nothing more than sliced brisket (not what was described and I even re-asked once delivered),  3 chunks of pork, and a leg and thigh(we asked for a breast).  All in all, we might go back, but will have to figure something else on the menu. This time wasn't worth the money.",0
6029,Great food and fair prices. My only complaint is that I should have gotten the platter instead of the sandwich!,1
6030,The food tasted great and the staff was very attentive and quick. I showed up a little before dinner time and I'm glad I did! This establishment is very busy around 6 o'clock PM probably because their food and service is so good.,1
6031,As a visitor to town this was my first and perhaps last visit. Brisket and sides (SP fries and green beans) were very good. You have to order the BBQ sauce and only get two choices--I prefer to have it all at the table so you can mix and match to your taste. Don't hesitate to go. Waitress was very nice.,1
6032,"Staff was nice and service was fast. The food was okay, however they were out of several items. My fiancé and I each got a 2 meat platter and got a cornbread appetizer. I felt that the portions were not reflective of the prices. We left hungry.",1
6033,"I had to revise my review with Black Dogs.  Their food is good, but it seems like they raise their prices all of the time.  You used to get two sides when you ordered a slab of ribs, but now they charge extra????!!!! Come on people!  You obviously do not care about your customers and we’re not going to continue to pay such outrageous prices because you feel the need to raise them.  I’m sorry I’ll take my patronage to Wood N Hog!",0
6034,"Cannot begin to say how awesome this food was last week! I was moving from VA to MN, so about 18 hours into our trip we wanted some good food, and we sure got it!! Parking was super easy, lots to choose from on the menu, and was happy with the portion size. If I make the 20hr+ trip again I will most definitely be stopping back at this restaurant!",1
6035,"We used to eat at the Urbana location.  The Champaign location is hard to find.  Food is OK, prices are up.",1
6036,"You can certainly read other reviews for the meat quality, but this is a vegan review.  Yup, you read that right, we had the pulled jackfruit sandwich and an Impossible™ Burger and they were great. Our server had a great knowledge of ingredients to guide us through other vegan options on the menu.  Added bonus was our omnivore friends had options 🐖🐄🐔🐟

The atmosphere is great for downtown. The service was quick and I liked their bar selections.  Many rave reviews of the Milo Bloody Mary!",1
6037,This place rocks! We were just passing through & stopped in for dinner. My husband & I are avid cooks and meat smokers ourselves. We split the pick 3 combo (pulled pork/grilled smoked sausage/burnt ends brisket) with spicy coleslaw....DELICIOUS! We will be wishing we were closer to this gem in the weeks to come. Great service - great food - nice atmosphere!,1
6038,"Meat good. Smoked meat very good. Smoked meat from Black Dog? The best.

But seriously, this is the best barbecue I've had anywhere. It's nationally-recognized as having some of the best food. I've never had a bad meal here, and the prices are very reasonable for what you're getting. Staff are always courteous and know their menu.

Also, do yourself a favor. Get the smoked sweet potato. You'll dream of it the next day.",1
6039,Fun place to eat and relatively quick for sit down if desired. Food tasted great and good selection of sauces.,1
6040,Food was good about a 1/2 hr wait to get seated .. the brisket is the best in my opinion,1
6041,"This is the most renowned bbq joint in Champaign-Urbana. Pork belly and burnt ends are really good, as well as the sides. It’s definitely quality bbq, and you’ll likely go back. But if you are a bbq connoisseur, you’ll likely find it well above average, but not awe-inspiring.",1
6042,"Whatever you hear about this place is true. This past weekend was my first time in the area and all weekend my friends were saying we have to go there. It's the best bbq place in town. They were consistently hyping up the burnt ends sandwich specifically. So when we went there of course I had to get the sandwhich and man they were right. It was so delicious. I had it with the hot Georgia peach sauce and was in heaven. Perfectly cooked, very flavorful, and just flat out amazing. I recommend everyone go here and try it. Definitely will be coming back to get more.",1
6043,"This place never disappoints.   I made sure to arrive just before 5 pm .  I didn't have to wait to be seated, and they were not out of burnt ends.  The service was excellent,  I was offered  multiple drink refills.  There are covid protocols in place, and I felt safe in dining there.",1
6044,"I'm something of a BBQ enthusiast. Absolutely the best BBQ available for many hundreds of miles in any direction, and I've tried it all!! The ribs and pulled pork are particularly excellent. They offer whole smoked turkeys at Thanksgiving that are unique and fantastic as well (but you better pre-order!). If I had to offer constructive criticism, I would say they need to be a little more generous with their fantastic sauces (and napkins). If you haven't tried it, you're missing out.",1
6045,"Me and a friend ordered the beef brisket and pulled pork combo with Mac n cheese and twice baked potatoes. Both meats were dry and tasted like they had been sitting for a long time. Mac n cheese tasted powdery and old. Potatoes were decent. My friend also got corn bread and it was very dry. Although, the staff was very nice.",0
6046,Burnt ends with cornbread and potato salads. Taste so good!,1
6047,"Speaking quality wise, this is one of the best BBQ places in town. Their ribs are delicious, chicken is good, their rib tips are huge, sausages are good, and their fries are the best in my opinion. Their sauces are quite nice and aren't necessary to enjoy the food, but are good options.

There are sadly some downs that prevent me from giving it a 5, the brisket is good, but not amazing, which is a dish I expect top notch BBQ joints to be able to cook. Also the burnt ends, while seemingly the favorite of people, seems to me to be just cut off portions of brisket. While this is the right cut of burnt ends, I don't think they get the treatment that makes them burnt ends (being smoked again, etc). Their cornbread used to be out of this world, but they changed them so now they're just decent.",1
6048,"A Texan's Review. They try their best. Asked for moist brisket, got a flavorless and lean cut. Wife got the pulled pork and it was dry and without flavor. You should beware any BBQ place that advertises the plethora of BBQ sauces they do, it's an automatic identifier that they are covering up for failings in the meat itself. Also got the beef ribs, they were well flavored, but extremely small. I'm used to beef ribs where one beef rib weighs 3 - 5 pounds, these must have been sickly cows. Pit beans were sweet, a sacrilege for pintos. Baked potato casserole needs more salt. No kids menu.",1
6049,"Delicious and chill! We had smoked turkey, burnt ends, and all the sides and loved it ALL! Tiny bummer - my $6 margarita was mostly ice... We would totally go back and try more things!",1
6050,"Food was flavorless and not anything we couldn't cook at home. Sides were sub par, and the chips and salsa were sad. Partner said the pulled pork was decent. Impossible burger was cooked to be dry, and their one vegetarian sauce wasn't good. I understand being a vegetarian at a BBQ restaurant, but its not that hard to offer more choices. I know there are more vegetarians in this area- have some more choices for meals",0
6051,Excellent brisket!!  Great food for a reasonable price.  Service was top notch as well.   Definitely need to put Black Dog on your go to eatery.,1
6052,The space is great. They did a wonderful job renovating the old downtown building. The food is always good. Staff is attentive and friendly. They give good recommendations if you ask. The portions seem to have gotten smaller though.  The specials are always amazing like the Cuban on Wednesdays or the Muffaletta during Mardi gras.,1
6053,"Incredible burnt ends, almost melted in my mouth. The wings were very juicy, and fell off the bone. Cole slaw was pretty bad, looked old and tasted older. Green beens tasted like tomato sauce, definitely not for me. Side salad was fresh and presented well. Overall, the BBQ here is the best in IL.",1
6054,"Thursday night. A little busy but plenty room in the bar. Food was great. Sampled the pulled pork, Polish sausage, and the brisket. Both the pork and brisket were a tad dry, but perfectly flavored. The brew selection was great. Both local and other domestic micro brews on tap and on bottle. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Friendly staff, great blues playing on the radio, and cozy environment in and old train depot. I'll be back, if I'm ever back in the area.",1
6055,"We were in town so we stopped by to try this place. First, the parking is inconvenient so be prepared to walk and it is a little hidden and the sign isn't big and flashy so be on the look out. It is a smaller restaurant, reminds me of a mom and pop restaurant. We ordered the burnt ends for the appetizer and it was GREAT! Where we are from, burnt ends are the outer edge of the seasoning and fat in cube chunks, theirs was sliced (little different). Next, i got a pick two that came with two sides and a few extra sides. The BEEF RIBS have a amazing smokey flavor and are huge and juicy. The catfish and the potato salad were so NASTY! Catfish was barely cooked and had a odd flavor and the potato salad was bland and orange? The mac and cheese tasted like box mac and cheese (kfc mac is better) but the GREEN BEANS and CORN BREAD are yummy! Will I be back? Probably not but it was a different kind of stop. Service was friendly, bathrooms VERY TINY.",1
6056,"Great BBQ here, great portions, and a good value. The rib tips are my go to here. Generally they are stocked up on meat but later in the day, they do tend to run out of stuff. This place is great for large groups too but they don't do reservations however. There's a wait list instead.",1
6057,"Absolutely amazing food. Melt in your mouth meat my family all ordered different types of meat and different sauces with them everyone was 100% satisfied and full. Staff was amazing our drinks stayed full and they were very friendly. Way better than hickory river smoke house, which I didn't think was possible but it is.",1
6058,"This past weekend the family got pulled pork, burnt ends, and sliced brisket along with a bunch of sides. Everything was absolutely perfect. I highly highly recommend trying this place out, everything was outstanding and I look forward to trying it again in the future.",1
6059,Every time I order it’s always on point delicious,1
6060,"It was about 1:00 on a Sunday afternoon.  We were seated right away even though the restaurant was comfortably packed.  The brisket was a little too fatty.  Their signature dish, burnt ends was very good, as were their sides.  Service was fine but not exceptional.",1
6061,"Found through others contributing and was impressed . Great service, great food an a great choice of BBQ sauce, the smoked Turkey could have been a little more smoked, but the chicken was perfect. The brisket was a little dry but proper and flavorful. The rib app was excellent. A great experience, will love to go back.",1
6062,"Was a great place to eat.  I had the ""try three"" with my wife.  Blackened tips, pulled pork, and pork ribs with a smoked sweet potato.  Was amazing.  The vinegar sauce was not to my taste, but just the meat dry was more than enough for me!",1
6063,"First time at Black Dog, it was pretty good.  Pulled pork, brisket and belly were all fairly well done.  Sides and sauces were also pretty good.

I'll have to go back and see how the consistency is.  It seems they do run out of certain items, and there were plenty of people in for lunch.   This gives me a clue that consistency may be fine.  Paying extra for a bbq sauce flight is a bit insulting.

Nice place",1
6064,"Stopped in for a lunch on a Sunday and had a fantastic bbq plate of pulled pork and brisket. Tender and flavorful. You get a choice of sauces, so you can get exactly what you want. Had a great local beer from Triptych Brewing just down the road. Great spot, will certainly be back!",1
6065,"I will start by saying that I am from close to Memphis so my idea of great bbq is different than most who will be eating here.

I wanted to leave a 4 star review based on the fact that the restaurant did not have chicken tenders for children but that wouldn’t not be fair to them.

Family friendly environment, we had an 18 month old and a ten year old with us, and the wait staff was very good.

My party had the following food items: beef brisket, smoked chicken on the bone, pulled pork, ribs, southwestern style potato salad, twice baked potato casserole, and fries. I sampled some of everything and it was all REALLY good. The potato salad was unique and wish I would have gotten another serving. The sauces we got were vinegar based. I was not a huge fan so I ate the ribs how they came which was fine because they were great by themselves!",1
6066,Hot fast good service pippin raspberry shandy is highly recommended,1
6067,"Great food, great customer service! Wait time at this area on a Friday wasn’t long but even if it was, it’s definitely worth it. I enjoyed good food by an open window on a sunny day. Very helpful and courteous staff with good recommendations. No doubt I will be coming back!",1
6068,"I've been to both locations a couple of times. Everyone else seems obsessed by this restaurant. And absolutely, their food is VERY good! I really like their ribs and their half chickens. My kids love the mac & cheese.    trouble is that they're always out of what everyone raves about. And I see how that's a selling point the first few times. But I've even been there for lunch and they were already out of burnt ends. So perhaps I'll come back another day and change my review to 5 stars. But after going several times and not being able to try the menu items that make them famous, we usually skip it as an option because we know we are almost certainly too late.",1
6069,Good BBQ with interesting sauces. Get the player combos and try many different meats,1
6070,First time here.   Burnt ends and spicy polish sausage were excellent.   Nice choice of microbrews available.   Coleslaw was decent but nothing to write home about.   Wait staff was attentive and friendly.   If half stars were an option I'd go 4.5.  Will return.,1
6071,"So good! If you like BBQ, stop reading this and go there now.

It's always busy / full parking lot. Thankfully the wait to be seated usually isn't too long.

The food is delicious! Everything we tried has been incredible. Comes out hot and fast. Even the drinks are good.

One of the top restaurants in Champaign!",1
6072,"This is, hands down, the best barbecue I have ever had. Ever. They have these things called burnt ends and these little pieces of deliciousness just melt in your mouth. They do have a limited amount of these and are available until gone at 11am and 5pm each day, so you need to get there early if you want to try to get them. The brisket and pulled pork are staples and some of our favorites, but we have also been impressed with their one-time specials. The sides are all excellent and their drink menu is superb. If you are ever in Champaign-Urbana, this is a must visit.",1
6073,"The food itself was good. However, the sauces were terrible. Couldn't find a single sauce for my brisket that I liked - they should have a normal BBQ sauce imo.

The service was below average. The waiter rarely checked on us and refills on drinks were infrequent. No plates were given with our BBQ nacho appetizer, which would have been nice due to how messy they can be.

Finally, they don't give you straws with your drink. If you want a straw, you can go get a straw made of straw, but you have to walk back to the main entrance. Kinda defeats the purpose of sit-down service.",0
6074,"Consistently great BBQ that is worth the drive if you don't live in C-U. Love the cuban sandwich, pulled pork, brisket, chips and salsa, sweet potato fries, and baked potato casserole. All the BBQ sauces I've tried are delicious. The wings are the best I've ever had.",1
6075,"Can never go wrong when deciding to dine here. Pork is smoked to perfection. Definitely gets busy on a weekend night but always worth the wait. Pulled pork always hits the spot. I try to save for leftovers just to eat it again. Love the twice baked potato, green beans and of course cornbread. Although the sides could be bigger but nonetheless delicious all around.",1
6076,I had the baby back ribs. The meat was tender and came off the bone easily but sauces were just okay. We enjoyed the cornbread with bits of bacon and the twice baked potato casserole was delicious. The elote was alright but we weren't a huge fan of the slaw. Service was good but we aren't sure we'd choose to go again.,1
6077,Ate on patio..great barbaque and side dishes,1
6078,"They have a nice selection of local brews and liquors. The service was friendly and speedy. The food was tasty, the only thing we noted was we would have liked for the tortillas on the tacos to be a little more grilled and also found the tortilla oddly sweet, but that may have been a fluke and/or a matter of preference.",1
6079,"It is not terrible, it did not wow me. Service was fast, but they were out of rib tips, their specialty, at about 1:30 pm. I ate the brisket, but there was not much flavor as the meat came out. The sauce kinda drowned out the flavor.",1
6080,I think that this place is resting on its Laurels a little too much because it does not do justice to the reviews that it's already received. The brisket platter portion is small as are the sides. Drinks came quickly which is a plus and the food was tasty but Christina G as our server was not very pleasant and was rather rude when asking to be paid. I almost felt as though she wanted us just to get out to make room for other customers. Lack of a Desert menu was also surprising. I doubt very much that I will come back to this establishment.,0
6081,The staff is friendly and the food is always amazing. The BBQ sauces keep me coming back and the pit beans are too fantastic to pass up,1
6082,Update from 2022. The wings. The sauce! The flavor! The service!!! All phenomenal. Truly enjoy the place as it is walkable area of downtown champaign.,1
6083,"An absolutely awesome place to go! Great beer, great food and sides, cool atmosphere. I highly recommend going around 5pm for a chance to score burnt ends. The sausage is also highly underrated. And the best sauce is the Carolinas and the Georgia peach.",1
6084,"Had the chili polish combo. it was a bit spicier than i normally prefer but tasted good! Service was ok, messed up my order but fixed it quickly.",1
6085,"This place will absolutely wear you down with Covid regulations. You will feel like you just got done working a eight hour shift, trying to follow all the rules. They say they are just following Champaign county guidelines but no other restaurant is this bad. I’m going to need a long nap after that experience also their napkins are just awful. The
Food is okay.",0
6086,"I am from Texas and very picky about my barbeque. I had brisket and burnt ends and was not disappointed. The green beans were nothing to write home about but the smoked sweet potato was great.  I would definitely go back. Get there early - we got there at  5 for dinner, before they ran out of stuff. Meat was just coming off the smoker.",1
6087,"They have extremely tasty food. Prices are alright with a bunch of good deals thrown around in there. The staff the two times I went weren't amazing by any stretch, but they did their jobs.
If you're feeling BBQ, this is definitely the place to go.",1
6088,At my work we have a running joke because every time our customer comes we ask if he brought us Black Dog. Today he came with lunch and it was awesome. Please open a store in Indianapolis because I don't think uber eats would drive 2 1/2 hours to bring me this!,1
6089,"Awesome food with awesome atmosphere plus kind waiter!
But a little pricy",1
6090,"Superb BBQ.  I had both chicken and brisket/sliced beef.  Lean brisket, but very tender and juicy.  Wait staff is not too great at refills, etc. but they are super busy as this place stays packed.

They also have sweet potato fries that are wonderful.  Applesauce has a lot of cinnamon, so keep this in mind if ordering.

No plastic straws here - they use the paper ones.  So bring your own straw if you want a good one.",1
6091,Best BBQ I've had. The hot grilled Polish is amazing consistently. The best value here is the double platter.  Get two main courses with two sides.  Sauce options are all stellar. Favorite place to eat in town.,1
6092,It was a nice place to eat at. The staff was very friendly and did not have to wait long for the food. I just wasn't impressed. My fries were greasey and I ordered smoked turkey sandwich and did not like the white sauce that was on it. The building was very impressive. The price was a little over the top for just sandwich and fries. I will give it another try but not impressed.,1
6093,"Best BBQ in the CU. Excellent sauces and tremendously prepared meats. Locations have good beer selection as well. Almost lost a star for shrinking portions and rising prices, but this is a local icon. Second Champaign location added much needed capacity as well as a very cool setting ambiance in an old train station building.",1
6094,Beef brisket was dry to over priced back home in Mississippi six people could of ate for what it cost for three people and you would of been full just saying I could smoke better on my grill,0
6095,"Best BBQ I've ever had. TV set expectations high, and this place delivered. In house brews, and small time distillery whiskey make this place one of a kind (well 2 of a kind since there are 2 locations).",1
6096,"Came here on a short trip for a night from Chicago. Before coming here, I was told that this was not only one of the best BBQ joints in all of Illinois, but in the country too. I had to see it for myself to find out - and I was not disappointed.

I'm sure any meat you pick will be delicious, but I had the amish turkey and it was very juicy and tender. They also give you two sauces of your choice, and if you wish, you can order a sauce flight, where you'll get to sample all of their sauces. If you order a platter, you get to pick two sides (you get one side if you pick a sandwich). Regardless of what you pick, make sure you get the sweet smoked potato as your side - I really want that again.

Great job Black Dog Smoke & Ale House! I'm not sure when I'll be back in Champaign, but if I am, I will certainly eat here again.",1
6097,"Husband and I both had burnt ends platter.  He had mac n cheese which was average and so where the fries.  I had the  pit beans which had a srrong flavoring I didn’t care about.  Both of us are not fans of the burnt ends, not sure why this place is so popular.  We love Hickory river barbecue a 1000 times more.  Will never come here again",0
6098,❤ the cuban sandwich. Only available on Wednesdays! I like mine without pickle and a side of georgia peach!,1
6099,"Loved it, very cool place, the food was great!  My husband and I had the pulled pork, Rib Tips were awesome and burnt ends were fantastic. Great food and staff.  Prices are very reasonable too!  We will be back!",1
6100,"I had the three meat combo with catfish, pulled pork and burnt ends (brisket). None of the three were spectacular, just average for BBQ. Only two sauces come with an order.  I didn't know which two to order so I ordered a flight of sauces, for an additional $2.50.  The flight includes all seven sauces with the exception of the habanero reaper and a white sauce. They were brought to me as party of my normal order.  I wasn't enamored with any of the sauces. The sweet potato was good although it could have been hotter. The corn bread was very good. I was disappointed because I had heard that the restaurant was nationally renowned.",1
6101,"Went here on the recommendation of a co-worker who attended the University of Illinois. The food was solid, but service was incredibly slow. Also, I understand how barbecue restaurants tend to work, especially ones that smoke, with limited supply, but I think half of the main items on the menu were unavailable when we were there, which is disappointing. Also, good-looking beer list, and I wanted to get a brew while we waited for a table, but bar service was sporadic. Lots of servers just passing by or standing there without helping with people waiting for drinks. When I finally did get one, I was given the wrong beer.",1
6102,Great and delicous beef & ribs platters. Had a good time eating lunch at Black Dog,1
6103,"Food was ok. Sauce was good. Arrived at 5pm for dinner and they were out of burnt tips, Turkey, ribs, and a couple other other items. That was like half the menu. Waitress didnt care one bit about it. Oh well...",0
6104,Great food and a solid beer selection.  They have an ok cocktails selection as well as good whiskeys to wash down the BBQ. Be sure to get their early of you want burnt ends. The Champaign location has a larger smoker but they still run out well before close.,1
6105,Great food and great service! That's all you could ask for!,1
6106,"Excellent food.  I had a platter with ribs, pulled pork and sweet potato fries.  Ribs were well spiced, juicy, lean and meaty.  Pulled pork was tender and moist.  Sauces were good, bit almost unnecessary.  Also had corn bread that was just ok.  I'd try another side next time.",1
6107,"Best in town! The burnt ends are amazing but you have to get there early before they are gone. They have them at lunch and dinner.

Also like the twice baked potato casserole and sweet potato fries.  I've never had anything but great experiences here!",1
6108,Fantastic burnt ends!  They are only available while supplies last at 11am and at 5pm.  Also a great pulled pork sandwich.  Nice little outdoor seating area as well.,1
6109,Really fast service. The pineapple pepper margarita was delicious! All the meats were amazing and the sauces. You can't go wrong ordering anything off the menu.,1
6110,It was kind of cool.  Bbq gone upscale/hipster. The restaurant is really nicely decorated and well light. The food was good but not big portions like you would expect from a bbq place. I did not care for how they worked the sauce so I ended up with a sauce I did not care for. The bbq was good. I really liked the beans and the potatoe casserole. Wished I would have done the 3 meat dinner. They have special save the earth straws made out of straw...,1
6111,"Best barbecue in Central, IL. Baked beans are the best I've ever had. Awesome cornbread. Lots of sauces to choose from. Please open another location so the wait is no so long.",1
6112,"Wow!  We have eaten here two days in a row.  Everything is good but now I have narrowed it down to the brisket.  Oh, yum.  I might try the burnt ends next time but definitely the brisket!
I have tried four different sides, all we're good but none were spectacular.  I have had the corn bread, sweet potato fries, green beans, and brisket chili.  Did I mention the brisket?
I have tried four of the sauces and the sweet peach is my favorite followed by the Lexington Dip but don't cover the brisket up with sauce.  It isn't humane.
If you happen to be here for Sunday brunch add a cinnamon roll.  You will thank me.  It comes iced with a sweet cinnamon icing and toasted pecans.  It is enough for two.
The English pub hand pumped North Coast Red Seal is worth the wait according to my husband.  The Old Fashioned is incredible with the house infused bourbon and the macerated cherries.  And the Pineapple Pepper Margarita is my favorite.  I know it sounds odd but the flavor is amazing.
Staff is friendly and accommodating.  They tag team tables to make sure everyone is kept happy.  They also know what to order.  Talk to them.
The only negative is that like any good BBQ they run out of BBQ...and during busy hours it can be quick.  Get here early so you aren't disappointed or have a back up in mind just in case.
Be prepared for a wait and to have your entire party here before being seated.  Sign your name in on the board and have a seat at the bar to enjoy a drink.",1
6113,"We're regulars here. The brisket, burnt ends, and pork ribs are consistently delicious. They serve everything until it runs out, and some go quickly, so if you have your heart set on burnt ends, rib tips, or turkey, show up closer to 11 am or 5 pm, when they are pulled out of the smoker!",1
6114,"Pros:
Friendly staff. Wings were great (although they missed one of the 6 and questioned it after I addressed it then brought 1 out on a platter and was sarcastic about it), BBQ nachos were also good.
Cons:
Catfish tasted like river water couldn't finish it, soda was flatter than the Midwest, and after asking for straws we we're informed they only have drinking straws made of hay... And they're in a dispenser on the bar and we have to get them ourselves because they're not wrapped, the dispenser does a great job of breaking them for you, but in case you get one out whole, handle with care as the hollow horse food is fragile.
Nothing seemed over the top, sauces we're bland and mostly vinegar, brisket was alright, sides were meh. On to paying, they don't give you a ticket to show charges, they just read it out loud for everyone to hear from a tablet, then hand it to you, only to see what was charged after you've paid.
2 appetizers, 2 entre platters, a plate of all their sauces to try ($2.50), an extra side, and waters to drink. $53 plus tip.
Will probably skip next time we're in town.",1
6115,"We had preorder dying graduation weekend. We were 15 minutes early, it was ready no problem MD delicious. Order was correct, poor were friendly, even in a crazy weekend.",1
6116,"I kind of enjoy the wait when we eat here. Always a fun crowd and interesting drink options. Burnt ends are great, turkey and chicken are my favs! I haven't had a meal I wasn't pleased with and service is friendly and helpful.",1
6117,Came in with my brother and his fiance for his birthday.  Overall pretty decent things came really quickly but they were only just warm.  Decent flavors good smoked meats.  I get it's a BBQ joint but a little broccoli or something couldn't hurt in the menu.,1
6118,"I absolutely love coming into Black Dog whenever I am on campus. I have not found a parallel to their barbecue anywhere in the nation. If it's your first time visiting Black Dog, try and get some of their Burnt Ends. I have never had a piece of meat so tender. If you missed them, you can't go wrong with their pulled pork. Also, if you're over 21, try the Pineapple Pepper Margarita. It's the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. I'm a loyal customer for life.",1
6119,"Black Dog Champaign has much more room than their original location in Urbana, however the food still tastes the same...GREAT!  I love the atmosphere of the old train station.  Great choice for a second location; your saved a hidden gem and you have expanded your BBQ empire!

If you BBQ and have never tried their burnt ends...you should be ashamed of yourself!  They sell out fast, but once you have some...you'll understand why.  If you aren't fortunate enough to get some of these...try ANYTHING else.  They take great care of there food, and the staff is pretty awesome in both locations.  If you and hungry for BBQ for lunch sometime...Do yourself a favor...if you don't have time to sit down to eat...call in a lunch order (lunch starts at 11am in Urbana).  You can thank me later.",1
6120,Excellent barbecue and a great selection of beers.,1
6121,"My latest visit will probably be my last.  Service was not good, menu is decent, food is good but they could use something new.  The server told us where they keep straws ( implying that we have to get our own) the server also just walked up at the end of our lunch and says ""okay, that will be (our bill price)"" this is a very odd practice.  She was almost taken back when I looked confused.  I had no reason to doubt her except a bill is typically presented instead of announced.  I mean she wasn't the most attentive server so how do I know that our ticket was accurate?  Regardless as I mentioned this is a pretty good bbq place that simply seems to be struggling with very fixable issues.  But until these problems are resolved I will not be back.",0
6122,Great place to eat! Had the baby baby ribs.  Delicious! Twice baked potato casserole also very good! Urbana salad very good! Service was pretty and good too!,1
6123,"Black Dog is a local/regional gem. I haven't been to Champaign-Urbana since they opened their 2nd location in downtown Champaign, but they are still as flavorful as ever. I had the pulled pork sandwich with Georgia Peach sauce and loved it.  Just the right amounts of smoke and sweet.",1
6124,Great BBQ and beer on tap for days.   They were very accommodating.  They will put whatever sports channel you want on their many TVs that they have.  Great atmosphere.  Can't wait to be back in IL to eat here again,1
6125,"Always the Best brisket in town,  love the spicy smoked sausage,  and the ginger soda (yum). However last visit my hubby did get a dry brisket sandwich and the waiter was more than happy to replace it!",1
6126,"Wow. Heard that the food was good. Had to try it. Wow, that was excellent.",1
6127,"Never disappointed! This place is  a must!  The Ends are a must, the chicken salad best I've ever eaten, my husband ordered the rib special it was absolutely amazing! The staff all work as a team and are so friendly and efficient! Highly recommend!!!",1
6128,"This is a long time local business. I have been a customer of the Urbana location, but I have come to the Champaign location more recently.
This location is much bigger, so wait time is less. Of course, if you doesn't have a reservation, rush hours will be crowded and it takes some wait. However, with Covid-19, this location offers carry-out, and you don't need to order beforehand
They have a patios with some 40-50 seats, if you want to sit down.
The price is reasonable. I usually order the platter with two sides. Pretty much full for me.",1
6129,"Pretty good catfish sandwich, but the two winners today were the sweet potato fries dipped in the Georgia peach bbq sauce.",1
6130,"This was the third time I ate here. All food was great, especially I liked catfish, pit beans, elote (cold side) and the sauces I tried (Georgia peach and Texas). The service was fast, maybe thanks to us coming at 5 pm ahead of the main crowd. The only thing I could complain about was the lack of free WiFi, but then I've come here to eat, not to work. 🙂",1
6131,"Best barbecue in the region, hands down!
If you want burnt ends, you have two small windows of time per day to get some because the servers will yell out ""86 ENDS"" before you know it (Meaning no more burnt ends available). Burnt ends go FAST.

Both locations are comparable in quality and freshness of food. I usually go to the Champaign location for proximity reasons.
The food is delicious and the service is adequate, even during peak times.
Good selection of beers as well as barbecue sauces (get the flight if you're new/unfamiliar)
Pricing is fair and the parking is plentiful at both locales.

P.S. Get the cornbread, you won't regret it.",1
6132,Worst experience ever. Pulled pork nachos came with chips an like a cheese ball on the side. Mac n cheese that came with my meal was still frozen. The sandwich that we ordered was also terrible. Meat was so over cooked the piece broke off. I will be calling tmrw an taking my complaint farther.,0
6133,"My husband and I went to grab dinner late probably around 8. They told us that at least three of the items that we were there for were sold out so I end up ordering pulled pork and then was told 10 minutes later they didn't have that either. I said I didn't want anything and then they brought a plate out with spicy sausage (which I didn't ask for).

I ate a little since they brought and my husband are some too. We didn't expect to be charged given their mistake and then were charged for the meal I clearly stated I didn't want as well. We didn't make a fuss but won't be in any hurry to come back unless it's earlier in the day. Food and environment are fun but service was extremely poor.",0
6134,"As a vegetarian, YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THE SMOKED PORTABELLA MUSHROOM. Literally it is amazing. They put goat cheese, roasted red peppers and basil pesto on it, and it is probably the best vegetarian option at a BBQ restaurant ever.

Also give their Texas Caviar a try, it's black-eye pees in like a little bit of a vinegar sauce with some onions and stuff. Served with chips, really fantastic flavor. Good starter for a table of 2 and it's only $2.95 (as on 11/1/2016).",1
6135,"Best BBQ stop for middle-of-nowhere Illinois. I've been here several times during my college career and although BBQ is not my forte, my mother loves going here whenever she's in town. Meat and sauce selection is great, and the location is not only a nice restaurant but also interesting since it's a converted train station.",1
6136,"Best BBQ in the city. I like the burnt ends, but love the brisket. The burnt ends run out, so go earlier if you want them. This brisket tastes good with no sauce, which is the true test. They will not seat your party until everyone arrives, and they have good parking which is rare downtown, although you still might not find a free space.",1
6137,"Good service and fun beer list but the food was bland. Pulled pork sandwich had no flavor, mac and cheese was gritty, the catfish was fine, but nothing to wrote home about.  Also the electronic billing system they use means you are observed while leaving the tip which is always uncomfortable, making the end if your visit less than enjoyable.",0
6138,"The night was slow. Only handful of customers were in attendance. Once the doors are open you are greeted with a atmosphere of orangish yellow and friendly staff. The service was good; however it should have been with the lack of other customers to compete with as chicks fight to be feed first. The food was good. The serving size of the rip tip was good for one full meal and a snack for another day. There was a downside the rib were greasesy, but that the nature of bbq. I had the Georgia peaches it's good if you like something with sweet without a kick...it's not for me. Overall the food was good.",1
6139,I moved away from Chambana 4 years ago and I still go to this place. Get the burnt ends before they're gone for the day!,1
6140,"Black Dog is always good, but when they're on, boy howdy - it's unlike any other experience. Went on Sunday and had the best meal of my life. The burnt ends were absolutely heavenly, total meat perfection, the pork belly sandwich was phenomenal, and our service was terrific.",1
6141,"The best smoked wings in town! Perfectly smoked and lightly fried to give the skin a nice crispy coating. The downtown location has more seating, but the service seems to be slower.",1
6142,My Lady took me to this fantastic restaurant and I really enjoyed myself!!! The food and our server Corey was awesome!!! I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant!!!,1
6143,Rated best bbq restaurant in town. They do run out of burnt end if you go too late in the night. The corn bread has meat pieces mixed in and is a must have.,1
6144,"When the place first opened up in Urbana, it was undoubtedly the best bbq joint in town, but now I feel their quality had slipped while others have gotten better. I think it's now a better bar than a restaurant. I still like the fact that they're menu items have more variety than others, but sadly their meat no longer compares to the ones I've had in the south.",1
6145,"Delicious food, nice atmosphere, good service.",1
6146,Ordered our food. Set there for an hour. Waiter cam up and told us they lost our order. No offer to take money off our bill for mishap. Won't go back.,0
6147,"I had some of the worst service of my life here. Our server was not at all friendly, and then proceeded to ignore us for the majority of our time there. We went half an hour without him asking us if we needed anything, while we were still waiting for our food (I can appreciate how busy Black Dog gets, but I also appreciate when the server communicates with me about that). Eventually, our meal came out before our appetizers did, and our server did not even ask if we still wanted the appetizers after our main meal, much less apologize for the mistake. If it weren’t for the fact that they force you to tip a predetermined amount in front of the server, I would have tipped much less because for a $60 meal, I expect way better service.",0
6148,Love coming here. I was disappointed to see they removed their pulled jackfruit burger. There is only one other vegetarian/vegan option.,1
6149,"Smoked meat and fish done right, and 8 great sauces.",1
6150,The food is always top notch and they have a good selection of craft beer on draft to wash it down with. You may have a short wait for seating on nights and weekends but they do an efficient job to get you seated as quickly as possible. The wait is worth it.,1
6151,"Best BBQ in Champaign, Urbana, and savoy.  Reasonably priced. I tried all the sides and they are all delicious. Their brisket melts I'm your mouth. It's so tender and my favorite dish they serve.",1
6152,"Eclectic and trendy place. Seems to always be busy, according to those who took us there. The burnt ends beef brisket sandwich that I had was a ten star sandwich, the meat was cooked perfectly - you can tell they know bbq. My wife had the chicken breast sandwich and it was a little pink, but delicious.
The cole slaw was a different story. I think that runny, tart, vinegar based slaw is a thing, but it was awful. It tasted bad, and the cut of the cabbage was horrible. If they would have made the cuts long and slender, instead of square, small and chunky, it would have been a different experience.
Our server, Isaiah was one of the best, other servers jumped in to offer refills when they noticed drinks low and the hostess was very friendly. The entire staff was a 10, so absolutely no issues there.",1
6153,We love it. The  food is good. It is a little expensive,1
6154,"I will never be coming back to this restaurant. We had a booth in the bar and our waitress wanted us to move because we weren't ordering food. They didn't ask nicely and we did end up ordering appetizers. I would have understood if they asked us to move since we were in a spot where people could have ate dinner, but they were not polite about it. Then when we went up to the bar to get a birthday shot as we were celebrating a birthday, they said ""We aren't that kind of restaurant"", and wouldn't serve us. They were extremely rude and I used to recommend this place all the time but now it will be the exact opposite. VERY DISAPPOINTING.",0
6155,"Best BBQ in Champaign! Always love coming here- smoked salsa is a great appetizer and the two meat platter gets a lot of bang for your buck. Came here for our last night in Champaign- I always order beef ribs and they were out- but then brought me some sort of chopped up beef rib as well as my original order. Wide array of beers, ciders, etc as well. Great people and great food.",1
6156,"The service is lovely and so are the people. The food is also great - my second time there, had the same meal (beef ribs with smoked potatoes and french fries) as the first time, still tastes great! I highly recommend!",1
6157,Best place for BBQ in my opinion! I buy their sauce too to use at home. Their adult slushies are amazing as well. One of my favorite places in CU!,1
6158,Pretty ok briskets. Just wasnt really bad. Great fries with it. And their cole slaw was pretty good. Didnt have to wait long for my food. Of course it was my first time dineing here. Overall great experience of trying it.,1
6159,"Food was good, portions were decent. Nice assortment of BBQ sauces. I thought sides could use some improvements. Overall good dinner.",1
6160,"I think this might be my #1 barbeque place that I've ever had. They have decent portions, but it's the spice in each plate that elevates it above the rest. The plates that let you choose two entrees are my go-to, with the chicken always as one of the choices.",1
6161,"Great selection of food, especially if barbecue is desired.  Also excellent selection of micro-brew beers on tap.  The building is in old train station that has been completely refurbished.  I would return in a heart-beat!",1
6162,"Great service!  We had an excellent waiter named Frank.

I absolutely LOVED my smoked catfish with Habañero Reaper sauce (I love spicy foods), green beans with bacon and tomatoes, and the mac & cheese!  This restaurant also has Mexican Coca-Cola, which uses cane sugar instead of the high-fructose corn syrup we use, so it tastes A LOT better than American Coke.  I also highly recommend the Southern Mango Sour, an alcoholic beverage that's pretty self-explanatory but amazing.

It was a very satisfying meal.  I've lived in Kentucky my whole life, but if I'm ever in this area again, I'll GLADLY stop by for another meal here.  It DEFINITELY earned my 5/5 stars!",1
6163,"The food was quite good. There was a lot of variety in the meats, sides and sauces.",1
6164,The food was good but I must say I found the waitress and the mater to eat to be very unprofessional almost downright rude if it wasn't for the quality of the food I would not go back. But the food is the great save and it's kind of in and out of the way location not easily found,1
6165,"TASTY, as they'll tell you but there's better smokehouses in town that won't empty your pockets. The dine in atmosphere is definitely higher end than most bbq joints in town tho (for the bougie).
A good treat for if you want to spend 20 bucks and not be full 🥰",1
6166,"Ok now what the heck.  Why does everyone go crazy about this place?  Dry ribs, gritty Mac and cheese.  The wife said the corn bread wasn't that good.  The burnt ends were decent.  We didn't care for the sauces we tried but I feel like sauces are subjective to one's own preference.  I will admit the service was good.

Black Dog is average at best.  Both my wife and I agree there are better BBQ joints in Champaign/Urbana area.  Hickory River in Urbana to name one.",1
6167,"O.M.G. Where to start...everything is fantastic. Burnt ends are amazing but sell out quickly. The sides are just as awesome as the meats- best collard greens around, cornbread is fantastic- I could go on and on. There's usually a wait but well worth it!",1
6168,"Had three meat platter, pulled port sandwich, burger, and a side salad. Food was decent and the service was good, but nothing special about it. The side was very dissapointing as the m&c was a day old, not properly heat up, the green beans was mushy, and the cole slaw was nothing but cabage marinated in red wine vinegar. Corn bread was interesting, but one was fresh and the other one was from yesterday. I like the fact that they tried to be environment conscious and use biodegradable boxes and straws.",0
6169,"Food is great, service very good, a bit expensive, signature margaritas are fantastic, long wait, we were there at 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon, wait of over 40 mins, were already out of 3 items, a 4th ran out as we ate",1
6170,"Some of the best smokehouse food I've found traveling. Price is on par for other similar places in the area.  It is a bit pricey, but the $$ is well spent. I would suggest the ribs, they are fall of the bone tender and the rub is delicious without adding the sauce.",1
6171,"Great food, with a total smoke house entre food style. Great ""rotating"" selection of craft beers, like you might find at a brewery tasting house. With a friendly experienced staff.  Definitely, one of the best spots in town!",1
6172,Beautiful place. It's a shame we had to sit on the patio in miniature green house. The green house did keep us plenty warm in 30 degree weather. Food was excellent!,1
6173,I lived in the south for 17 years. This is the best BBQ I've had outside of Texas. The mac and cheese wasn't great though,1
6174,"I really enjoyed Black Dog. The Polish Sausage was seriously stupid good. I had the turkey too which was good, but wasn't the best turkey from a bbq place that I've had. I had the Georgia peach bbq sauce which I liked, but I loved the Chipotle. I also had the corn bread and normally corn bread isn't my thing, but this stuff was delicious. I like the atmosphere. The building is awesome and we had great service. I'd highly recommend checking this place out if you haven't been there yet.",1
6175,"The atmosphere is great. The staff is typical inconsiderate college kids.
The resturant does a great job letting you know what they're out of to set expectations. The problem is they ran out of green beans, beef ribs, macaroni, and meatloaf. At 5pm you probably shouldn't be running out of this many things this early.
WAY OVERPRICED.
Save the time and don't go here.",0
6176,"Fantastic barbecue. Maybe my all-time favorite and I've been to many around the country. I'd tell you to order the Burnt Ends, but I want to make sure they have some when I'm there. Potato salad is a bit spicy but great! And the twice baked, cheesy potato casserole is another great side option. Get the corn bread—there's pepper and meat baked into it—and a couple sauces. The cole slaw is good but not the sweet and creamy kind you're used to if you're from Chicago. Ok, as for the meat, you really can't go wrong. The brisket, pork, and sausage are probably the best options as far as regular BBQ fare (OK, aside from the supreme Burnt Ends), but the burger is quite good too. Don't pass up an opportunity to eat here.",1
6177,"I came here because I saw that they were now offering the vegan impossible burger. Not only was it cooked perfectly but they didn't cheap out on the lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickel. The fries there are amazing and I had an awesome time. Definetly will come again due to their catering to vegans.",1
6178,"Waited to be seated 30 minutes because they were busy, but it was worth the wait.  Beef brisket sandwich and sweet potato fries....DELICIOUS.  Even my picky hubby liked the food.",1
6179,I went there on a Saturday for lunch with my Wingman and had the beef brisket and Mac an cheese and French fries. It was delicious. It was really busy but we were waited on quickly. I will definitely be back again soon.,1
6180,"Friendly staff and delicious food. I get the pick 2 with the brisket and the Polish sausage, though the pulled pork is also good. Great variety of sides as well.",1
6181,"Best BBQ in Champaign, hand down.  The burnt ends sandwich is the single best sandwich in all of Champaign, and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.  Have to get there early or they run out, and parking can be tough on weekends (there's no way to turn around in the parking lot, so if you drive in and don't find a spot it can be extremely difficult to get back out again if you have a bigger vehicle), but it's worth it.",1
6182,This was my first time at this place and i will not be back.  The wait staff  and host with the manbun was rude and would not let our group of 8 sit with each other. Half of our group was seated  next to the kitchen where I saw the ENTIRE kitchen staff handling food bare handed. The food was mediocre at best. The only time our server came back to the table after we had ordered was to set some extra menus (that we did not need or ask for) on our table  as she was passing through to the kitchen. The only thing I  actually enjoyed was my bottle of bud light. Will not be returning.,0
6183,"Best bbq I’ve ever eaten and I can’t wait to go back.   The place draws a big crowd.   Even so the service is fast, friendly and cleanliness is outstanding.    Anyone that appreciates great bbq will never be disappointed.",1
6184,Great place. So wonderful smoked meats. Love their pulled pork sandwich. And they have a variety of great sauces to choose from. First time here. Definitely coming back :D <3,1
6185,"Just ok....fun historical atmosphere, busy place on a friday night and the service was friendly. The tap beer wasnt as cold as would have expected. Sauce selection was good, try the peach! But over all the lrg ribs were just bigger bones and sides were nothing special. Disappointing they were out of turkey and at least 2 other menus items.",1
6186,"I was worried this place wouldn't be as awesome as the original Urbana location- but it's just as good! Same style and service, too. 5 stars for pulled pork sandwiches with hot georgia peach sauce, slaw, mac n cheese! Just as insanely flavorful as ever! If you miss Black Dog in C-U, you're missing out on the best pulled pork I have ever eaten!",1
6187,"The portions were small, food was average.

My main complaint was the policy that your whole party has to be present to be seated. We had a party of four and were waiting on one. We could have ordered drinks at the bar or an appetizer while we waited. Instead we had to wait at the door until she arrived. I get what the were trying to do but it turned into a loss of business and angry customers.",0
6188,"Excellent atmosphere, plenty of quality beer and food options. Blackened tips and Cuban sandwich are with the trip.",1
6189,"I just visiting champagne for 3 weeks I have been to this location twice, a song of food and besides to be exceptionally well prepared, Nelson critical insight. My lady friends had pulled pork platter very generous portion of pulled pork I ordered a combo of two which is $3 more the combined weight of my protein didn't even nearly match what she got, I don't understand this oh, she had a glass of chardonnay $5 , I thought that was an exceptional value I asked the server to get me a draft of something local it cost $11, that is unacceptable and I am from the Chicago Market that is a rip-off",1
6190,"Good BBQ. I had the beef brisket sandwich and it was tender and flavorful,  good char. My husband had the pulled pork which was tender and smoky.  Ordered the bbq sauce flight and enjoyed the sauces from around nation.",1
6191,"I had the Smoked Brisket Salad with Blue cheese dressing and Peach BBQ sauce, Delicious! My wife had a Cheese burger with peach BBQ sauce and yummy green beans with tomato, also a Cole slaw that was very good!",1
6192,"They are not Big Bob Gibson, it was food, late afternoon so I think I got the dryed out ribs, because 1 of the 3 foil packages were fresh. Way to much smoke, back off that stuff. Wifes wings were old and too much smoke also. We were so hungry, now feel yucky. Place looked clean and up scaled, took this to go.",1
6193,Their Cuban special was delicious!,1
6194,"Some of the best brisket and pork I have ever had.

Ever since I got my own smoker, I make bbq the way I like it and I feel I do a better job than many bbq joints. However, Black Dog has me going back to my recipe cards to figure out how to make it the way they do.

Pro-Tip - If you get a 3 meat platter and are getting both burnt ends and brisket, just get the burnt ends so you can try both the pulled pork and the ribs or a sausage.",1
6195,"Probably the best barbeque I've ever had in my life. The burnt ends are incredibly good but they run out quite fast. The beef ribs are also incredibly good; juicy, tender, and amazing sauce. If burnt ends are still available, I'd highly recommend getting choose 2 with beef ribs and burnt ends. If burnt ends are not available, getting the Polish sausage is also a great choice. It's hard to go wrong at Black Dog. People are quite packed at 6pm so I recommend going ~5pm if you don't like to wait for long.

This place is a must eat at UIUC!",1
6196,"Hands down the best barbecue you'll find in the C-U area. I've only been able to get the burnt ends once because they sell out fast every day. Everything is great here but be sure to try the burnt ends if available, they're a local favorite!",1
6197,"Staff was very friendly and accommodating as we had a large group with multiple small children.  The service was fast and the food tasted great.

It wasn't too crowded or loud so we were able to have a nice relaxing evening.",1
6198,Both this location and its Urbana location are phenomenal. The food is consistent between the two and service is always good. I'm all about their ribs and cornbread. Definitely recommend eating here for any occasion.,1
6199,"Burnt ends are where it's at, the chipotle BBQ sauce is great, and they have a good selection of beers on tap. I make a point to eat here whenever I visit.

I just wish the portions were larger.",1
6200,"Black Dog BBQ is a favorite among the locals and students who attend(ed) the University of Illinois in Champaign.

Great selection of BBQ, sides, and alcohol.  Always great service and very friendly staff.

Be sure to plan on waiting 20 - 45 minutes to be seated.  They now use an iPad to have customers sign in and they will text you when you're table is ready.

While waiting you can grab a beer or soda and they will just add it to your tables bill when you eventually get seated.

You have to try all the BBQ Sauces.  Get the sampler for only $2.

TIP: Burnt Ends run out fast,  but they replenish them around 4 O'clock for dinner. So if you want Burnt Ends, you have to eat an early lunch or early dinner.",1
6201,"Tried the brisket queso this time and it was fantastic! Looking forward to seeing nachos back on the menu, until then the brisket queso scratches that itch.",1
6202,"You have got to come here AT LEAST ONCE before you leave.

Even though they didn't have what I wanted to try out, I was just fine with what ever they had. Its BBQ! And with BBQ comes options.

Love the bar area. We got to watch FENCING! Wow! Never been into a bar that has a crowd for comptetive FENCING.

If you like cocktails definitely do the MANGO SOUR!

They have quite a selection of SAUCE for your BBQ platters. They serve beer. I was surprized that they never heard of Sapporo. I am just like that though. I like different beers over time.

Everyone in here is like a team member. They shout out things that need to be made. It felt like I was on a baseball field hearing the ball get passed to one another.

The atmosphere here feels like a moving train car. Because it is so long, but stout in the hallways. It seriously feels like I am riding on a still train. I love the place though. I will definitely come back here again.",1
6203,"Great 'cue, fine brews, excellent attentive  service, your choice of open air patio dining or quality AC - what's not to like? This was my first visit and most certainly not my last.",1
6204,"Classic. Service is a little rockier than in Urbana--but still great. Always check your to-go order is a little tip, sometimes they forget the coleslaw or sauce. A wonderful bbq joint, and a special taste of C-U.",1
6205,"Great friendly staff. Amazing food. But out of so many things....until 5:00PM. Saturdays are big days, maybe make more??!! Just saying. I would go back in a second. Hoping to try some of the dishes our table couldn't.",1
6206,"Excellent food, slow service but with the right beer you may appreciate the wait.  I feel like they missed the ball by not making the place bigger with more seating.  There is always a line and or a wait here.  Note: limited menu",1
6207,"Way overhyped! This place was just not thought out very well, huge bar that takes up a third or more of the restaurant, 30-40 minute wait, minimal seating, average service and the food is just OK. Brisket was overcooked and tough, something as simple as mac & cheese tasted like it was made with powdered milk, bland! I've had much better BBQ right here in Champaign. Great, LOUD, BAR not so great restaurant!",0
6208,My son has told us this place numerous time since he has been studying at UIUC in past four years. We went after his graduation ceremony yesterday. All are good as been told. Meat are fresh and juicy. Best place for the meat lover.,1
6209,Haven’t had anything here I didn’t like and I’ve tried just about everything. Turkey and chicken are outstanding and my favorite. Good beer selection and even better whiskey options. Great prices as well. Fast service too.,1
6210,I went to eat at Black Dog with my wife and friends during a rather unusually busy Tuesday night. We were still seated quickly and the service was top notch. The food was also stellar. I would highly recommend.,1
6211,The rib tips I had on my recent visit were the best I've ever had anywhere,1
6212,"Heard high praises from many locals about the burnt ends and we managed to get there before they sold out. They were okay but to be honest we didnt find their burnt ends to be all that, mediocre even. Their regular beef brisket, ribs and twice baked potato cassorle were the highlights of our meals and even than weve had better. Mac and cheese was bland and smoked turkey seemed as though it were reheated and not heated quite enough.",1
6213,Love this place for BBQ. The burnt ends are excellent if u can get them.  the beef brisket is to die for.  The service is excellent.  I can never go wrong with a meal at black dog.,1
6214,"Excellent food.  With the new iPad ordering that the wait staff uses the food arrives very quickly.  With that said, I've never found them to be particularly friendly or attentive.  However the food is good enough to give them 4/5.",1
6215,"I'd heard about Black Dog for a few years but hadn't had the chance to go up and visit, well we finally got to and it was absolutely worth it. Very cool venue in the old train depot. The food was fantastic and the beer was fun and local. I hope to be going back soon.",1
6216,"My friends and I came here on a Friday night for a bachelorette party. The bride and I were the first 2 there and we saw a sign that Said they wouldn’t seat us until the whole party was there. We sat in the waiting area when a bartender asked “what’s the name on the order” we let him know we didn’t have a to go order. He then asked “ok? Well do you need a menu?” We said no we will be dining in but have to wait for the rest of our party. That’s when the hostess walked up and with an attitude and stated “well you still need to sign in and we’ll just skip you until everyone is here.” On of the members stated she was going to be a half hour late due to construction. When all but her showed up the hostess asked if everyone was there, we let her know that we were waiting on one more. She said it was fine and that she would seat us anyway. We let her know that we were fine waiting one the last member. She said there was no need to wait. Once seated it took about 15 minutes for our server to come over. We ordered drinks, appetizers, and food right away. Our food came out shortly after our last member arrived. When she asked for a menu the hostess stated “she doesn’t get a menu” luckily our waiter was very nice and let her order anyways.
Long story short the environment felt very hostile and we were very uncomfortable. The food was good but they were very small portions. I’m not sure I will be back.",0
6217,"I'll start off by saying that Im vegan, so I obviously didn't choose to go here, but it wasn't impossible to find something to eat. The waitress was knowledgable & the salad I had was decent. Something I could've easily made at home & not worth $10, but decent. The portabella mushroom was smoked beautifully, but much smaller sized than the waitresses said it would be. The sides that come with the platters were on the small side, but tasted ok. My sis (who lives here) is in love with the burnt ends & the sweet potato fries.",1
6218,"The best barbecued pork anywhere!!! This was my first visit, and it most certainly won't be my last!",1
6219,"My girlfriend and I went to Black Dog during peak dinner hours, and although the wait was a little long, it was definitely worth it. The atmosphere was great, the good was awesome, and the service was excellent. Black Dog remains one of my favorite places in town!",1
6220,"Food and drinks were good, atmosphere was also great, but our service good have been better. Our waiter did not seem happy to be there (maybe he was having a rough day) we sat out on the patio and once our food came he  never checked on us until it was time to pay.",1
6221,"The service was awesome,  Justin was very thorough about the beers and the food!  The Pork Ribs were AMAZING and the burnt ends were GREAT too.  Great atmosphere!",1
6222,"Great Service! Good air circulation, warm winter greenhouses, safety protocols followed during Covid for a safe, fun dining experience. Excellent food!",1
6223,"It just doesn't get any better in town. Their ribs are phenomenal, and the brisket is too. If you manage to order burnt ends while they still have some you may be ruined like me and cursed to never leave.",1
6224,"The service was very indifferent, could have cared less if we came or not. The food was tasty, liked the choices of bbq sauce.   Very quick to tell is they were out of two items on the menu.",0
6225,My boyfriend and I love this place! We are new to the area and this is definitely our favorite restaurant so far. The prices aren't bad and the food is AMAZING. They also have a nice selection of local beer!,1
6226,"Just average BBQ food, nothing really different about it. Food was decent and service was good, just wasn’t impressed with it since we drove out of town. However, the BBQ sauces were good.",1
6227,"Best BBQ in town. Have gotten so many people hooked on it, including my celiac inlaws. There aren't a lot of places they can go that offer decent gluten free food, so this is a treasure for them. It's my favorite as well. Highly recommend the geogia peach and hot geogia peach sauces",1
6228,Great food and very fast service.  Loved the Blackdog cornbread!!!,1
6229,"I had the pulled pork with Georgia Peach sauce and sweet potato fries, both excellent. My wife had the pork belly Sunday special, which was phenomenal. Great service.",1
6230,"Great food, burnt ends are amazing, sauces are great, although the sides weren't anything to call home about, and the portions were a bit light. Still a fantastic staple of the area",1
6231,Great food fast service.  This really is one  of the best places in Champaign to eat.,1
6232,"Great staff! Even better BBQ. The ribs, the burnt ends, the pulled pork, the brisket, even the wings. All sooooo good! Located in a unique spot. Bbq lovers can't go wrong here!",1
6233,Solid beer selection and best bbq in town,1
6234,"Great place for BBQ, in downtown Champaign. Smokey Brisket & tasty pulled pork. Lots of local craft Brews and friendly service. Reasonably priced. Enjoy.",1
6235,This place is always a crowd pleaser! Everyone we bring here loves it. And can we just talk about the twice baked potato casserole?!  *swoon*,1
6236,Really good b.b.q. Was hoping to avoid the late lunch hour crowd. Didn't happen. Next time we'll call ahead for take out!,1
6237,"BBQ sauces are served and sold per serving for some reason, in small containers. Would rather prefer bottles of their different sauces or larger portions. Service was decent.",1
6238,The experience was fine. But the brisket chili made all three of us sick. So there's that,0
6239,"Food just lacked flavor. I judge good bbq on several factors but the main being it doesn’t need sauce, this needed sauce. The catfish was bland and kind of had a gooey texture. The chicken still had blood in it like the color of If I just cut myself, idc about what the internal temperature reads that’s just unappealing. The brisket was decent and so was the polish. The cornbread reminded me of eating savory raisin bread or something that’s not a good thing. The fact this was one of the top rated bbq places in town I wasn’t expecting much because there really isn’t good bbq here but I was not expecting this. This was a pick up order btw so maybe it would’ve been better eaten right away but I doubt it would’ve changed much. One and done for me.",0
6240,"The meat is mediocre, the sauce not that good. The atmosphere is nice, but there are much better tasting BBQ options in Champaign or Urbana.",0
6241,Pretty good barbeque. The mustard sauce is awesome.,1
6242,There’s a host with a man bun that has the rudest customer service. They don’t allow reservations so you either show up with your entire party at the same time or you’re all eating at separate tables at separate times. The food is horrible and I don’t recommend the pulled pork because it’s nothing but burnt skin and fat,0
6243,"I took vegan impossible burger. Trust me it was not impossible to eat. Infact, it took me hardly 2 mins to finish it. The price I paid was definitely not worth it. Further, taste was okay. Other restaurants do have better options.",1
6244,"Amazing food, and great service the times we have been to the Urbana location. Highly recommended! Can stand up to any BBQ in Texas.",1
6245,"Unacceptable.  Boycotting.  I took a date there who could not / did not want to eat pork for religious reasons.  We trusted that a restaurant that has  ""vegetarian"" entrees would at least label any side dishes that contain meat.  Nah.  Discovered bacon mixed in with their ""potato casserole"" that was not described in the menu.  I'm not going back until they fix their menu.",0
6246,"I'm not a really a fan of BBQ, however, of all the places I've been taken this was my favorite. Great beer selection helped me enjoy  my experience,  the staff were also swift courteous and all around highly efficient.",1
6247,"Stellar BBQ and nice restaurant.  Wait can be long during busy weekends at UIUC, so call ahead to check the wait status if you are looking to eat right away.  New restaurant in the old train station has been restored beautifully",1
6248,The Sandwiches and Platters are priced well and have excellent meats.   Only negatives are parking and wait time. Only time I go during peak times is when our friends request we go. Otherwise I only go during non-peak times.,1
6249,The catfish was outstanding! Sauces perfection. We even bought some to go! Ambiance lovely. Service timely.  Definitely worth the stop.,1
6250,"I've been going to the Black Dog in Urbana for a few years and have always enjoyed it.  The Urbana location was small, and always busy.  This was a fresh change.

The food is nearly identical.  The quality is just about the same.  The bourbon selection is pretty good. I found some Stagg Jr. around $8.00 a pour, not a bad price.  They have a great rotating bourbon selection, just like their Urbana location.

The new modern decor really helps.  Also does the added space.  The bigger dining room doesn't make the place seem cramped.

What needs improvement is the service.  Our service was very short and not very friendly.  This was on 1/10/16 around 7:45pm.  It seemed our server just wanted to call it a night and peace out.  Bad service leads to a bad experience.  If you fix the service, then you've got a 5 Star establishment.",1
6251,Seriously Great BBQ.  Parking is limited.  Remodeling the train station to be a restaurant is very unique.  Very Narrow and Crowded but worth it.  Good craft beer selection as well.,1
6252,one of the best place in Champaign,1
6253,So glad I found this gem right in the middle of town. Great staff. Great environment and the food is even better  sometimes bbq joints are one in the same but this one stands out from the rest. We go back every chance we get,1
6254,Delicious! The portions are nice! Rib tips on point!,1
6255,"I don't understand how there are people that don't like this place. Excellent service, beyond amazing food and the best booze selection of almost any restaurant in the area. They catered our wedding rehearsal dinner and that was AWESOME too!",1
6256,Went to college in N.C. and I have to tell you this place is the real deal!!! The best Carolina bbq around amazing smoke you can smell from blocks away! Highly recommend if you come to Champagne you should eat here!!!,1
6257,The hostess and waitress were friendly but the food was NOT good at all. If u like food from a can this is what everything tasted like. The fries were good but nobody messes up fries...well I hope not,0
6258,"To expensive for what little you get.  Everyone made a big deal about the burnt ends, the ones I got were 90 percent fat.  Won't make that mistake again.  The inside of the restaurant is nice I like how the remodeled it.",0
6259,"Food was great! Sat at the bar with Frank waiting on us.... he's the best!! Enjoyed a great meal and a Kentucky Buck and a Pigsney Porter with our meals. Excellent! Food,  drinks, and Frank; I highly recommend!",1
6260,Best DAMNED ribs I've had in years! But the price has nearly doubled in the last few weeks!! I'm firing up the grill!!,1
6261,"My family enjoyed the turkey, chicken and brisket.  Some of the best smoked meat, by far.  Highly recommend!!",1
6262,Awesome barbecue and tasty side orders with great appetizers. Excellent service and prices,1
6263,Get there early!!  Excellent BBQ.  There is a sign posted when they run out of various items but it may be out only temporarily.  Burnt Ends are limited so be there early or you'll have to try on another visit.  We will definitely be back!!,1
6264,"This place is amazing. The staff is friendly, and the food is delicious. You have to try the beef ribs. I recommend getting the hot Georgia peach sauce. All in all, this is the best place in town.",1
6265,Great smokehouse. Multple bbq sauces to suit many. Can get busy due to popularity and we waited 45 min but well worth the wait. Delicious. Near RR and looks like train station office so a little tricky finding. Free parking.,1
6266,We love Black Dog. It has consistently good food. Be prepared for a wait but it is well worth it!,1
6267,"Friendly staff, short wait for food, loved the combo platter! Burnt ends were amazing, but be aware they typically sell out pretty early, by 6pm according to our bartender.",1
6268,Excellent burgers and fries! Well worth the wait! Superb waiter Zachary! Thank you for making our first time visit exceptional!,1
6269,"Excellent.  One of the best restaurants in town.  Really recommend the cornbread, rib tips and the extra spicy ghost pepper sauce.  Good selection of drinks on tap, and always excellent meats.",1
6270,"Very strict covid dining in rules, which I'm a fan of!  The waiters were attentive and the food was great and well priced. I didnt show up early enough for burnt ends, but the pork sandwich was good. Get the mustard sauce.",1
6271,"My wife and son love this place. I don't. Food is good, but nowhere near the best Q I've ever had. Seems like a place riding on their reputation. Not impressed with the staff.",0
6272,"I heard so many wonderful things about Black Dog, and when I finally came here myself I was so impressed. The food and atmosphere are great, and the staff is friendly and attentive. I got burnt ends and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good food and great service!",1
6273,"This is the best BBQ within 2 hours of Bloomington, and well worth the 45 minute drive to get there. One of my favorite places to eat in Illinois.",1
6274,"Solid food at a reasonable price. They have a time limit of 60 minutes due to COVID, but we were rushed out after about 30 minutes before we had even ordered everything we wanted",1
6275,"My favorite BBQ in town! The burnt ends and cornbread are amazing. Fun atmosphere too. Kind of small, but it adds to the charm.",1
6276,Good brewery for those who are staying in town for a short period of time. Has good selections of craft beers and ciders as well. Overall a good place to spend the night with some friends.,1
6277,"Reading the other reviews, I was expecting a much better dinner. The food is good, but in my opinion far from 5 stars. Service was fast and nice. Overall it has a great atmosphere.",1
6278,"Went there for lunch.  The brisket sandwich had amazing flavor and I loved the sauce that they recommended with it.  When I get barbecue, I expect a lot of meat in the sandwich did not deliver that",1
6279,"I really enjoyed the cocktail menu, and I would come back for drinks anytime. The service was fast and friendly. The food was average.",1
6280,"Best barbecue in the area! Must try the wings, burnt ends, and brisket. Lots of great sauces. Get there early before they run out.",1
6281,Such good food and awesome staff!,1
6282,Some of the best barbecue I've ever had. The habanero BBQ sauce isn't too hot and has great flavor.,1
6283,Eh...twas ok. Prices are high for what you get. I didn't care for the bbq brought to me. Famous Dave's is better. I thought i would try because of all the hype. Great atmosphere. Food ok. Wait staff was great.,1
6284,Excellent BBQ! Pork ribs were perfectly cooked.  Rib tips fatty and decadent. Great selection of beers and BBQ sauces.,1
6285,"Wonderful bbq, wait staff, atmosphere, and food! It's best if you come really early, it gets busy during dinner hours and later. They have burnt ends at 11am and 5pm!",1
6286,"Easily my favorite restaurant in town. Amazing beef brisket, burnt ends, catfish, barbeque sauces, and more. Prices have increased recently though, sad.",1
6287,"Great BBQ. Everything is fantastic. In particular, ribs, pulled pork, nachos, twice baked potatoes, beans, sweet potato fries. Go here. Enjoy the atmosphere and food!!",1
6288,Food & service was great!,1
6289,"Amazing food..we tried pulled pork, burnt ends and the brisket...all were absolutely delicious!!  Neat environment and friendly staff 🙂",1
6290,Great burnt ends! The smoked sweet potato was good too. This place never disappoints.,1
6291,Excellent BBQ!! We sat at the bar and received our food fast!  The ribs and chicken were amazing! We will definitely be going back!,1
6292,"Nice location, good food, and good service",1
6293,"Same great barbecue as the (original) Urbana location, but more seating -- wait times have been consistently shorter since this location opened up. Anything on the menu is good!",1
6294,"Best BBQ. Biggest problem is that once you eat here  you might not want to eat at any other BBQ places anymore. Love the sliders, a little taste of different types of food.",1
6295,"Great BBQ. The rest of the food is very good as well, but I highly recommend getting the burnt ends. Good drink selection and reasonable prices. This is one of my favorites in the Champaign Urbana area.",1
6296,"Finally had the infamous ""burnt ends"" and they were really good... Waitress was really nice,it was just great to be able to have a place to eat in this apocalypse...loved the Mac n cheese",1
6297,Great atmosphere. Friendly laid back staff. Fantastic food and good prices. Beer heaven!!! So many choices like you've never seen before.,1
6298,"I want them to franchise, so I can have this regularly in south Dakota! I always stop in when I'm back in Champaign, Illinois. It's a must. I would make a recommendation, but it's all good...try everything. Oh...and they do have the Impossible Burger here.",1
6299,"They have outdoor seating during phase 3 of Illinois mandate. Food is good, but the menu is limited during this phase. Service is always good.",1
6300,Very unhappy from beginning to end. Sat in the kitchen literally not happy at all. Threy couldn't decide who was going to aerve us...and too forever to get a refill. More noise with the girl yell two feet from us to the front of the resteruant. Worse place ever...now the food. Not everyone like there meat medium well (still.pink) and the jambalaya was so dry and thick as hell not good at.,0
6301,"Salmon was unbelievable! Brisket was great! Twice baked potato casserole was awesome! Green beans were green beans, nothing special about them.",1
6302,"Food is consistently awesome, I think the staff has a lot on their plate, could be nicer but the food makes up for it. I will say they are not very party friendly though.",1
6303,"This place is over rated. Small portions, our server looked like she didn't want to be there. Was rushed to pay even though there were no other customers in line.  Food was tasty but with me it's all about the experience, won't be coming back.",0
6304,"This is the only restaurant in my life that I've included as a specific line item in my monthly budget. Thank God for this delicious food and their great selection of beer; recently tried the Big Thorn stuff, has been fantastic.",1
6305,"Very popular with locals, this is a no-frills but somewhat upmarket BBQ joint. The food and service were good, but it was weird that there were no desserts available at all.",1
6306,"Nice, casual atmosphere and good food. BBQ isn't the best I've ever had, but is some of the best food I've had in Champaign. Wait time is hit or miss.",1
6307,"Their rib tips were super juicy, and the sauce I had was really good too. Our waitress was polite as well!",1
6308,Prime rib sandwiche was good but pit beans and Mac n cheese are lacking. Service was not great but not the server's fault. She was over worked.,1
6309,"One of my husband and I's favorite places to come to. Great food, fast service and environment.  We enjoy sitting outside under their awning.",1
6310,Just finished another amazing meal.  This time we sat on the new patio... with misters to keep cool (a pineapple-pepper margarita helped too).  Never disappointed with Black Dog!,1
6311,This place was recommended by a friend because it has some of the best ribs around. Tommy the bartender recommended I pair the ribs with a green flash sea to see lagger. Definitely the best pairing ive had. I will definitely be back.,1
6312,"From another reviewer:

""The hype here is largely caused by the self-imposed shortages of items like beef ribs and burnt ends.  They run out every day, which either means they are inept planners (unlikely) or are doing this on-purpose to shape demand.  The fact that the waiters make a big overt announcement to diners that there are only a few portions left suggests the latter.  I've actually had the burnt ends, which is a dish I generally enjoy, but these were a letdown.  The fact that they continue to have daily shortages begs the question of just how popular these items would be if you could actually get them on demand.""

I am not sure you understand what ""burnt ends"" are. They are not something that can be accurately predicted or prepared ""on demand"". They are exactly what the name would suggest: the burnt ends of the meat that are a result the of the smoking process. There is no saying how much will be produced. I can't speak for the lack of availability of beef ribs, but I can say that when it comes to real bbq, nothing can be prepared ""on demand"". It takes hours. So, if a lot of people order a particular item one day, and they only have so much room to smoke, they are going to run out of things. They are not a factory. Perhaps you would be more satisfied at the type of place that has vats of pre-cooked items in the kitchen that only need to be heated before serving. I am thinking something in the vein of Applebee's riblets. I think the concept of Black Dog is lost on people like you.",1
6313,I like the pulled pork and pork rib. The sauce flighter is good deal. For the side I think they have the best sweet potato fries I have ever tried.,1
6314,"I've eaten two meals here this week, it's pretty darn good.  Lots of food for a lunch but would be great at dinner.",1
6315,Stopped here on a trip back home. Very nice restaurant. Food was good and service was great. Even though it was very busy on a Sunday afternoon our wait time was not bad.,1
6316,"Excellent barbecue and the place looks somehow bugger on the inside than it is on the outside. They only serve the burnt tips twice a day so if you like that type of meat, make sure you plan accordingly.",1
6317,"A great location, great service, and great food. I wish the burnt ends weren't always hard to get, but it's some of the best BBQ you will ever have.",1
6318,"If you're looking for a good sit down, bbq place, this would be it. The food here is excellent, and the staff is kind and courteous. I would highly recommend this place to friends and family.",1
6319,"This is the worst, most expensive bbq place ever...the bbq ribs tasted horrible
...banquet tv dinner ribs are better than these ..no joke!! Will never buy again! What a waste of money!!!",0
6320,"Great ribs, nice beer selection, and relatively relaxed environment. We seem to find ourselves here at least once a month when we need some good smokey barbeque.",1
6321,Food was good. Several sauces to choose from. The brisket queso appetizer was great.,1
6322,The burnt ends nachos were amazing but the rest of the food was ehh. Staff was rude and seemed to be bothered by our questions. As much as I enjoyed those nachos I probably won't go back.,0
6323,I have never been disappointed by Black Dog either in Champaign or Urbana. The ribs are perfectly smoked and the service is prompt. It's always a great experience.,1
6324,"I ordered their catfish sandwich with fries.  The bread was flavorful and toasty, the catfish was amazing,  and the fries were soooo good. Everything was great, absolutely great.",1
6325,Love the food!  Great atmosphere. Pulled pork and brisket was wonderful.  Our favorite place to eat.,1
6326,"Awesome food. Fast and friendly. Small beer selection, but some quality brews, and good selection of bottles. Definitely get the burnt ends if they have any left.",1
6327,10/10!! Corn bread os bomb! Double baked sweet potato 🤤🤤 pulled rib sandwich.....wow. no complaints. That corn bread tho...,1
6328,The train station was very nicely refurbished into a first rate Black Dog!  The food is still super good!  You have to try everything!  The beer selection is great and I know you will enjoy it!,1
6329,Great food and great service!,1
6330,Excellent place for a gathering of friends to enjoy really good smoked meats.  I enjoy the brisket sandwich and the coleslaw is really different but tasty.  A wonderful place to eat,1
6331,"Missed the mark. The mac and cheese tasted like powdered cheese, the brisket was dry, cornbread was awesome. It might have been because it was 8:30pm ? .",1
6332,"This place is awsome! Great food! I can't wait to come back here again from Vicksburg Michigan, when I visit my son again. Friendly service.",1
6333,"Great ambiance, awesome service. My favorite is the pork ribs platter. They also have really nice whiskey, and the staff is good in suggesting.",1
6334,Difficult to find unless you live near. .they have NO SiGN! BBQ food was quite good however. It comes very FAST so don’t order until u want to eat.,1
6335,This has been our favorite restaurant for years!  Went a couple weeks ago and they have a new menu and it’s not good.  UNBELIEVABLY disappointed.  Can not believe it. You should be ashamed,0
6336,"Their food is to die for! Reasonably priced, kid friendly, great place to go with a group of people or just by yourself. Staff is friendly. Have never had bad food or service!",1
6337,"Dine-in, Black Dog is the best barbeque you'll have in C-U. Carry out seems to have less quality control, so eat there if you can.",1
6338,"I was here a few years ago and remember it being a great meal. Perhaps the value of success, but this trip I found the meats to be a bit dry and the staff a bit busy.",1
6339,"The food is amazing! Go early for dinner, since they tend to run out of the most popular items, and be prepared to wait a few minutes for a table.",1
6340,"Brisket was a bit dry, but the pulled pork made up for it. I recommend the pit beans. Decent BBQ overall",1
6341,Amazing food.  One of the few places that puts quality above everything else.  I eat there regularly and have never been dissapointed.  It's a Champaign/Urbana staple.,1
6342,"I got the catfish and had no idea they could pack that much flavor into a fish fillet. Amazing food, no wonder it is rated as high as it is. Definitely going back.",1
6343,"The food, the atmosphere... Everything was awesome!",1
6344,Awesome food ! Great waitress ! Service was quick . Food was hot . Flavors awesome,1
6345,OMG! SO GOOD! We had a party of 25 and still never went with an empty glass. Service was AMAZING food was AMAZING! I'm ready to go back!,1
6346,"Had a great lunch. Amazing food! Good prices, and drinks. Very efficient service. Would be a regular if i was a local.",1
6347,I was told that they don't accept cash for delivery when I ordered before to the hotel im at with cash they came here before now its a problem when I call but when my girl call it's fine don't wanna go there but you get what I'm saying,1
6348,Great BBQ and beers! Had the rib tips and they were very generous! Reasonable prices as well.,1
6349,"I imagine this is how BBQ tastes like in the South. Incredible flavors and a wide variety of sauces to choose from, and you can mix and match.",1
6350,First time at the Champaign restaurant.  Did not disappoint.  If you've never eaten here and love good food better head on down.  Service is good and the food is even better.,1
6351,"Good food; Burnt ends are a rare find in the upper Midwest, and they're pretty damn good. Very good service, and great location qith roomy booths.",1
6352,Great BBQ in a fun old train depot that is upscale and modern.  Lots of great sauces to choose from mild to scorching hot.,1
6353,"Outdoor tents are perfect! We felt so safe and of course, it’s a given, the food was amazing.",1
6354,"Tasty menu, lots of bbq sauce options.  Good place for ribs & pulled pork sandwiches,  plus sides. Good beer.",1
6355,"One of my regrets of moving away from Champaign is leaving black dog behind. I've never been a huge bbq fan, but they made me a believer.

EDIT: Bring black dog to St. louis. Food and beer are the centerpiece of the culture here. Sugarfire bbq needs a contender, and black dog is it.",1
6356,"Phenomenal barbeque, amazing selection of barbeque sauce, great sides and tasty drinks!!",1
6357,"I've never had anything here that wasn't good, the service is always great, and the beers are tasty, with a nice variety. What more could you want?",1

6360,Great food! Quick service! Always love to have atleast one meal here when we're in town! Highly reccomend!,1
6361,"5 stars usually. The last 2 times, food has been cold...especially the corn bread. Very little wait though, and most of the food is top notch!",1
6362,"Serving size was smaller than expected and meat was a tad dry. The texas sauce was average.

Service was good though.",1
6363,amazing food and experience.  Have enjoyed everything I’ve gotten so far in my many visits.  Must try the daily specials if you haven’t yet.,1
6364,Every time I come service and food amazing and I come from Waukegan IL recommend!!!,1
6365,"Hands down the best BBQ in the area. Great atmosphere, plenty of seating, friendly staff. If you are a fan of BBQ, you MUST visit Black Dog.",1
6366,"Any time we drive even close to Champaign-Urbana, we make a point to stay here. Food and beer are fantastic. Service can be a little slow because it's so popular but worth it.",1
6367,Amazing food- I’d recommend sitting in their enclosed “outdoor” area if it’s open- really cute out there! Also recommend getting there early because it’s popular and they will sell out of the best foods (burnt ends!),1
6368,Great selection of hot sauces. The hot Georgie peach one is to die for. Burnt ends available at noon and 5pm. Get em!,1
6369,"Service poor, Mac & cheese gritty and awful, corn bread was very dry, brisket & burnt ends were VERY good. Overall, not impressed.",0
6370,"Everything I've ever had here has been great. Their sauce options all taste good, and their sides steal the show.",1
6371,Excellent Food👍 pulled pork couldn't be any better.Very friendly staff. Food came out quickly.. Will definitely be going back...,1
6372,"Best BBQ in CU, or really anywhere in illinois. Burnt ends are my favorite, but get there early as they sell out fast.",1
6373,Very good! Just went to eat at a popular time to eat and had over an hour wait. Will go back just at a different time!,1
6374,"I ALWAYS stop here when in  the area.  Sometimes, I just hop in my car and drive there for their salmon or turkey.  Food is amazing.",1
6375,"Fabulous smoked salmon, pork, double baked potatoes! Champaign awesome free parking, nice patio space too. Great service!",1
6376,Excellent barbecue food served here along with a decent selection of beers. Would highly reccomend. A bit on the pricey side though.,1
6377,Best smoked beef I've ever had! And the waiter was knowledgeable and very helpful. Thank you!,1
6378,"Great place to eat BBQ. The wait can sometimes be very long, so make sure you leave plenty of time for lunch or dinner.",1
6379,"The food and atmosphere are very good, I just felt the portions were a little less than what we expected from a BBQ restaurant",1
6380,"Interesting place. The food was very good but the atmosphere felt a bit hectic when we were there. We have eaten there once before when in Champaign, and had much the same opinion. But the food is soooo good.",1
6381,"Easily the best barbecue in Chambana. Pulled pork, brisket, and a little Georgia Peach sauce is always a hit.",1
6382,So good! We were driving through the town and were surprised by how cute and hoppin this place was. The texas caviar was delicious as was the turkey sandwich!,1
6383,"Omg delicious l, quarter rack, catfish, Mac and cheese, fries yummmmmm longggg delivery times",1
6384,"Nice ambience and funky decor, great to have draft beer with hotdog",1
6385,My favorite place for BBQ.  Even if you are vegan you can enjoy the delicious impossible burger with their Georgia peach BBQ sauce.,1
6386,"Cool space.  Local beer list is decent.  The bbq is good, but unless you get there in time for the burnt ends you might be underwhelmed.",1
6387,"The food was delicious. But the service was not very good. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars. I'm not sure, but I believe it was too crowded and they weren't prepared to have that number of clients.",1
6388,Always great food and amazing service.  Get there early for burnt ends! The Turkey sandwich is awesome,1
6389,Excellent beer selection and food. The place is a little out of the way and hard to find if you don't know exactly where you're going. Extremely busy at lunch time,1
6390,Burnt ends every time.,1
6391,Everything is fantastic but I love the cornbread and twice baked potato. Good seating but no reservations so be prepared to wait if you are with a lot of people,1
6392,"Crowded, very crowded and many large parties of people. In addition to this there is no space for people to wait making it very awkward and the flow is terrible because all the waiting people have to stand In front of the door. Not the greatest system.",1
6393,Great place to eat. Excellent pulled pork the brisket was great and the barbecue sauces were amazing.,1
6394,"There is one huge problem with BD: Its too popular ;-)
From their point of view, its great. Try to not go that the very busy times, or you will wait. Send one person ahead and stay in touch with your party by telephone.",1
6395,Pretty tasty bbq,1
6396,Got the rib tips and was very good. By far the best value on the menu. Smoked wings on the appetizer are excellent.,1
6397,I have had almost everything on the menu and can honestly say you cannot go wrong here. Best BBQ in Illinois!,1
6398,Ate at six at night and they were out of about everything. Service was slow and the food was average at best. Waitress was nice but for me it didn't live up to expectations,1
6399,"Burnt ends are a must! They run out quickly, especially on weekends, so check in with the staff to see if they are still available that day. Your entire party must be there BEFORE you can be seated!",1
6400,Tried the Black Dog in Champaign for the first time.  Usually go to the one in Urbana.  The food was ok had a waitress who was training so the service was horrible.  Ill stick with the Urbana Black Dog Restaurant,1
6401,"Food was very tasty indeed, beer was awesome. Table service pleasant not hovering to much. I will go back .... Often!",1
6402,"Three stars for nostalgia because coming back into town from out of state i wont even make it in due to whoever answers their phones, thats one of the rudest interactions ive ever had with a restaurant with regards to answering questions. The gentleman could use some lessons on phone etiquette.",1
6403,"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. If you haven't been here before, you should. And definitely go for the pulled pork.",1
6404,"Love the bbq at Black Dog.  This was our first time at this location, and it was very cute.  The staff is friendly and the food is always good",1
6405,Smoking done right.  They also have a great craft beer selection.  I have never had a bad meal there.,1
6406,"Food was great, waiter was great! I'll go back every time I'm in Illinois!",1
6407,Always outstanding food and service. Always new and interesting local brews on tap as well. 3 hours away and I make it in everytime I can,1
6408,"Likely the best BBQ in town. If you can get there early enough to try to the burnt ends, do it. They melt in your mouth",1
6409,"Fall apart delicious smokey bbq, great sides, and the friendliest service I've ever had! This place is a gem of Urbana-Champaign.",1
6410,Nice staff and service. Expected more beefy ribs. Well priced and not so long wait for a table on a busy day.,1
6411,Brisket was amazing. so tender it was falling apart.,1
6412,Very good bbq. Service was great as well as the prices.,1
6413,The best Covid protocols that I have seen at any restaurant. The smoked pork sandwiches were very good.,0
6414,"Excellent food, however, the staff at this location are rude.  I prefer the Urbana location as it comes to over all dining satisfaction.  If I were the owner of this astablishment, I would be extremely worried about how the hired staff are treating customers.",1
6415,"Would never  go back this place was referred  toe as great BBQ
Try it while I was in town. TERRIBLE ATTITUDE I WALLED OUT EILL NEVER GO BACK WHEM I VISIT CHAMPAIGN",0
6416,"Best restaurant in Champaign! Very fast service, hearty portions, flavorful meat. Excellent side items as well. Even some vegetarian options!",1
6417,Pick any item on the menu and prepare your taste buds for an amazing ride.  This place is LEGIT!!!,1
6418,"Best BBQ north of St. Louis. Hands down the best in central Illinois, with 2nd place not even close.",1
6419,"Good food, great service. Great smokey flavor. Not the most kid friendly spot a.k.a no child's menu.",1
6420,"The BBQ at this place is amazing.  Every time I drive through Champaign, IL I make it a point to stop and eat here.",1
6421,"Busy place, but short wait. Good BBQ, not great. Service ok, but not too attentive. Food arrives quickly.",1
6422,"Brisket is top notch, absolutely perfect. Glad to have a place like this in town!",1
6423,Very delicious sides and pork! Many different sauces to try. Would definitely recommend it to a friend.,1
6424,This one is much bigger than the one in Urbana and is very new. The staff is great and helpful with groups and slitting checks. The food is amazing and is a top restaurant of CU,1
6425,really tender burnt tips and brisket.  decent local beer selection. cool location-old train Depot gives it a lot of character,1
6426,Ok. Out of burnt end and macaroni and cheese after 2 hours of being open. Tea glass never refilled.  Chicken was good. Might give it another try.,1
6427,"Popular place with great food and limited but excellent beer selection. Service was efficient and friendly, even though the night we were there was packed.",1
6428,A bit expensive but the food quality is simply amazing. I love their barbeques.,1
6429,The food is excellent! The restaurant is always clean and ALL the waiters and waitresses are always checking to see if you have everything you need.,1
6430,"Anything you order is amazing, with the new location you have a better chance of getting burnt ends. Great craft beers to go along with food.",1
6431,Food and Service was excellent..The  Smoked meat flavor..the sweet potatoes and corn muffins are just simply delish...So good!!!!,1
6432,Great food. Must try the burnt ends. Usually a wait to get seated but we'll worth it.,1
6433,"If you haven't tried this place you need to remedy that immediately. My vegan husband doesn't mind dining there either. Not many vegan options, obviously, but the beer list makes up for it.",1
6434,"Every time I'm driving through Champaign I stop and eat. There isn't one bad thing on the menu, it just kind of sucks that sometimes they run out of rib tips",1
6435,You can also buy their sauce to go if you ask.   The catfish is melt in your mouth. Definitely the star of the show.,1
6436,"Good food, but most meats are drier than I prefer - except the pulled rib sandwich, which is excellent.",1
6437,Best BBQ I've ever had. You know how good the food is because their place is always crowded,1
6438,"Great bbq place. Lots of smoked meats. Uncommonly good smoked turkey,  brisket is decent too. Tasty sides.",1
6439,"Rib tips great, brisket a little tough. Mac and cheese just ok. Green beans were great",1
6440,"Like the other location in the Urbana, the BBQ is fantastic. Where the Urbana Black Dog falls short, this location excels: plenty of space for the crowd it draws.",1

6442,"Wonderful barbeque, great tasting sides, ample portions, and a friendly staff. I would be a regular if I lived in the area.",1

6444,"One of the very few legit BBQ joints north of the Mason Dixon line....it stacks up with everything I've had in Texas, Memphis, and beyond.",1
6445,Long wait most of the time but it's worth it! Super great food. I recommend going when most people are off campus (ie: move in day).,1
6446,"Visit this place if you're in town. Amazing food, location, and service. Great beer selection and overall  ambiance!",1
6447,I still prefer KC BBQ but this place seemed popular enough. They were out of most things when I got there for dinner. I guess that is pretty common. They are supposedly known for their burnt ends.,1
6448,I love a good BBQ place and this fits the bill. Had the spicy Polish sausage and I was not disappointed in the least.,1
6449,"My words fail me. Best BBQ ever! Laid back atmosphere with excellent, interesting employees.",1
6450,Amazing food special all smoke or grilled made to perfect. They'll never let you down when your on an empty stomach.,1

6453,"Great atmosphere. Great service. Food is good, if a little of the beaten path, which some people will love, others won't.",1
6454,People who are saying the service is fast probably went to a different restaurant. Service is super slow even if you just order burntends which is already cooked. The food is not worth it.,0
6455,Enjoyable meal and good food. Nothing spectacular but it is good barbeque. The building is very cool and there's a great atmosphere.,1
6456,Brisket and Southwestern Potato Salad were fantastic!  Great customer service!,1

6462,"Awesome BBQ (and plenty of it!), great service, great atmosphere. This is promoted as a local staple and now I know why.",1
6463,This is some of the best BBQ. The new location means no more waiting for a table. As a legit BBQ be aware that they will run out of some of their meat by the end of the night.,1
6464,"Amazing food, fast service, reasonable price.  What more could you ask for?  Do yourself a favor and get the burnt ends.",1
6465,"Service was good, they also had enough parking, the restaurant was clean and organized, the food was ok.",1

6470,love the food delcious brisket best in the whole world great business nice place excellant sauce and corn bread so thanks for making such a expierce.,1

6473,"Delicious food, great sauces, those burnt ends are so good that I'd almost try eating the tray for the last bits of juice.",1
6474,"Absolutely excellent! We ended up getting two seats at the bar, no wait, and the food was killer! Don't pass up Black Dog!",1
6475,"Great atmosphere, smokalicious meats, loved everything but the goulash(cold btw, not bad), reasonable prices.",1

6478,Great BBQ.  Wish they had a more traditional sweet sauce,1
6479,Damn good Barbecue .   Great Service. Definitely have to go back to try their bbq beef ribs out,1

7300,"Lovely restaurant with delicious food.  I loved how each item in the menu had a recommended wine pairing guideline.

The Crispy Pigs Ear is an absolute must. The kale was perfectly flaky and crispy. **tip: ask for less salt as it was slightly on the saltier side**

Mushrooms 3 Ways was amazing too. If you love mushrooms, this dish will not disappoint!!

However, the Pork Shoulder was quite disappointing. I think the first two dishes definitely increased our expectations but the pork shoulder just missed the mark all together. We got a pork dish because of the name of the restaurant… but it was just underwhelming. The meat was very salty and it wasn’t warm for every bite. But other than that, we had a lovely time and the other two dishes really made up for it.",1
7301,"Very delicious restaurant. We sat at the kitchen counter and saw the cooks which was a fun experience. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful. We ordered mussels, pork ribs, and a goat cheese salad. Every item was delicious in it's own way. If recommend everyone getting some of those ribs! We will definitely make sure to come back here in the near future!",1
7302,This was an excellent choice for a coworker and I. We would completely come again to try more things on the menu. Excellent by glass wine menu. Bone marrow is well executed. Beets as the salad dish complemented well by the pistachios and goat cheese foam. The octopus with grilled vegetables was very well done. Foodies will be very at home here. We got chef bar seating and were fascinated what the cooks were making.,1
7303,"The reviews on this place were great and we have always wanted to try it when in town.  We finally tried it for lunch and it was really good.  They serve small sharable plates and everything we had was good.  We especially liked the whipped Feta with toast and the Halibut was amazing.  We also tried the sardines and some mozzarella item that was good.  I don’t have a single complaint about this place and I’m looking forward to going back.

There were three of us for lunch and two of us had a hard cider.  It was not a cheap lunch, that’s for sure. The bill for three of us was $116 not including the tip.",1
7304,So many friends recommended this place so here we are. We were warned that the dishes could be a little bit too salty so we asked for less salt. It turned out great! My favorite is the half duck. Cut it and put it in the slider with the yogurt - tastes amazing. The duck meat is very tender. My second favorite is the mussels soaked in rich tomato soup. Love this place and will come again.,1
7305,"I was blown away by my experience here. How can a dish under the ""Vegetables"" section titled something as simple as, ""Salt Roasted Beets"" be my favorite menu item? It was FANTASTIC. I will never forget how perfectly the whipped goat cheese went with the beets and how the pistachio butter somehow made the perfect complement to the meal. For this dish alone i would fly back to Chicago. If that weren't enough, the pasta was also fantastic. Such a hearty serving of the fresh house made pasta too! I couldn't finish it because of course i had to try a dessert to really embrace the full experience. I paired both of my courses with a wine recommended by the bartender and it all went together perfectly. Will definitely be back in the future!",1
7306,"I have not been to this new location of the restaurant since it moved, so here I am. I was glad about the new space as it is wider and can contain more people without being overly crowded.

There was a nice operational change that purple pig takes reservation via Tock now. This is a huge improvement since in the past it was first come first serve and wait time was always around 2 hours.

The waiter suggested 3-4 dishes between two people, so we got the crispy pork ear as appetizer, pork shoulder and half duck as entry, and eventually latte and Sicilian iris as desert. The food was quite extraordinary. Crispy pig ear was certainly innovative and fun to start with, pork should is super comforting, the half duck impressed me and the portion was generous, and finally the Sicilian Iris was rich and delightful.

The only disappointment was the latte, I think their espresso did not have a good quality, and therefore the coffee tasted badly. I guess people can’t expect too much from a cup of dessert coffee that only costs $5, but if a restaurant like this has anything on the menu, they should consider about the quality .

One odd thing I noticed during the visit was that several individuals from the big group next to us were standing on the seat and tried to see something outside of the window. Their waiter or any staff seemed not making an attempt to check on them or even stop them. I am not sure if that because everyone was occupied at that time, but it was slightly disturbing to other customers.

In general the visit was good. The price tag was certainly high, $40-60 per person without drink, so I recommend the restaurant for special occasions.",1
7307,"Came to try this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon, the wait was over an hour. When we got a table, we tried the pork lover pate, the grilled octopus, and the mushrooms.  The pate was great, it was well flavoured, and not too heavy.  The octopus was delicious, but the texture of the octopus was surprisingly mushy.  The mushroom was not bad.  I think it was worth the wait to come try.",1
7308,"The food was delicious. The service was ok! Portions of the food isn’t that big. The place was packed and they were able to keep up with the orders coming out really quickly. The server could’ve checked up on us to see if we wanted to order more, but didn’t. Only came once to refill our water. Server talked too fast for us to understand and the place was so loud. You can barely hear the server and can’t have a conversation without shouting. Not ideal for a family setting to eat and talk.",1
7309,"Decided to try squid ink pasta! It was actually amazing and probably the freshest, best scallops I've ever had. For the sake of fall, I got a pumpkin tart for dessert. All around great restaurant. I was sitting at the bar watching the cooks and they are so great at what they do and such hard workers! Every dish that I saw come out was beautiful and made me have the thought ""should have ordered that"". One thing that stuck out to me is that I got service and help from many people who weren't even my server. At least four different people came up and either cleared something away or poured me more wine. Everyone seemed to genuinely care about taking care of their guests instead of just their own tables. Also received some great recommendations from my server. Definitely try this restaurant!",1
7310,"We visited The Purple Pig after reading amazing reviews online. Would it stand up to the hype? The menu is based on a Mediterranean small plates concept, very similar to tapas. With so many items it was hard to choose what to have, but we started off with the Gnocchi and Buratta. Both were beautifully presented, and the Gnocchi was by far the best I’d ever eaten, very light, fluffy and beautifully crisp.

For the next round, we enjoyed a Turkey Leg and Pork Chop. Again, both were sublime, but the Turkey Leg was absolutely sensational. I ordered it with slight trepidation, as Turkey can be quite dry and bland from my experience, but this was Turkey – next level. It was so moist, flavoursome, and delicious, words don’t do it justice.

The cocktails and drinks we ordered were great too, and the service was both attentive and friendly. We spoke with the waiter about our meal and he was clearly very passionate about it. All in all, it was a sublime evening out, and it’s certainly worth adding this to your must visit list if heading to Chicago.",1
7311,"This was my first time here and I'll definitely go back. We didn't have a reservation but were open to bar seating, which meant we had a front row seat to the kitchen. Just watching the magic happen was amaze.

The tuna tartar was divine with a buttery, nutty hint from what I think we pistachios. The mandarin orange and avocado sent it over the top.

The mushroom 3 ways was decent. My partner liked it more than me, but it wasn't bad.

Get the broccoli... enough said there

For our entrees he got the crab pasta, I got the scallops - both recommended by our server. Both were yummy, but severely small portions for main dishes, especially seeing those other plates. I was still pretty full by the end. My partner was satisfied but still open to eat more. Men, 😆",1
7312,"Absolutely amazing gourmet experience. The pork belly was so darn tender. I'm not sure you can go wrong here but a lot of it is extremely unique, it's not for the basic average palate. If you have an advanced palate you will be handsomely rewarded.",1
7313,"Hands down the best place for roasted bone marrow. We were able to get a table without a reservation on a Sunday morning. I have been going to Purple Pigs many times over the years, and they have always delivered amazing service and food. Will be back soon!",1
7314,"The Purple Pig is easily in my top 3 favorite restaurants I've ever eaten at! The food and service was amazing! I highly recommend the Roasted Bone Marrow, the Grilled broccoli, and the Pork Belly! Next time I'm in Chicago I'm definitely going back to try something new. 5 ⭐️",1
7315,"My wife and I stopped here for lunch during our trip because of the high reviews and diversity of the food and were not disappointed. We tried a few different dishes starting with the focaccia + hummus (pictured), which was fantastic, the bread was delectable. We then got the mushrooms four ways (pictured) which were decent alone, but very good with the pork chop which was the main dish we shared (also pictured)",1
7316,"Gosh this was good. My favorite non-pizza restaurant in Chicago! Great value too for the quality, innovative takes on veggies. Pistachio and salted beets is a must-try. Ribs a bit too sweet? Carrot dish was so tasty.",1
7317,"A must have place in Chicago for sure. It’s one of my fave restaurants in Chicago and I always stop by when I visit. You can’t go wrong with anything on the menu. The highlights for me would definitely be all the smears, house made ravioli and octopus.",1
7318,"Brought some friends of mine to The Purple Pig and overall the experience was great. Food came out nice and quick, waiters were friendly and the food was delicious. For the price it was well worth it but it wasn’t a 5 star experience for me as I don’t feel the price was reflected in the portion sizes. I was left hungry and didn’t want to spend more.",1
7319,really nice — we had a view of the kitchen counter from our table and watched dozens of beautifully presented plates get taken out to other tables. good service and good system for a large restaurant. it was loud but also 8pm on friday night. nice decor. our food was good and although the restaurant can be pricey you could leave feeling full by getting 1 plate a person - generous portions and rich food. in that scenario you’d spend <$30 each.,1
7320,"Not your usual Mediterranean place. The Purple Pig is a James Beard Award-winning restaurant! All the dishes were flavorful and filling. Our waitress was very helpful with meal selection. The place has plenty of vegetarian options, although the restaurant’s name will tell you what they specialize in. The dishes were enjoyed by all of us, and I was pleasantly surprised by the fine food, excellent service, diverse crowd, and fine ambiance of Chicago in the restaurant. With unique takes on common dishes, it will definitely surprise you with food presentation. Please check out the pictures associated with this review and follow on Insta @ifooditie",1
7321,"I FINALLY got to try Purple Pig and I was definitely not disappointed. It's been recommended to me for years and I'm so glad I was able to have lunch with a friend here a while back. The food was great, the atmosphere was comfortable, and the service was impeccable.

Their bone marrow was absolutely delicious as well as their pasta with bolognese. The burrata was also very good, as well as their lattes.

The restaurant is inside of larger building so you have to go through a lobby to get there, but it's not hard to find. It can fill up quickly so definitely make sure to get a reservation!",1
7322,"Loved the food and the establishment. You can tell it’s popular as it’s very crowded. I had the shrimp and avocado salad, very tasty, plus the star of the evening- mushrooms 3 ways. So so good. Also portions are generous!
For dessert I had fiord di late, a pudding also very tasty. Highly recommend this place.",1
7323,"First off Mauro is the best he guided us through the menu and everything he recommended was amazing. We very quickly realized we should not even look at the menu and just trust his choices. He was very kind and really made this experience complete. This is our first stop in Chicago and I think it will be very hard to beat. We cannot wait to come back. Maybe tomorrow. The octopus was amazing, we ordered bread to mop up the last of the sauce left on the plate. We did the same with the broccoli. The pork shoulder was cooked perfectly, so fall apart soft it was divine. The ribs were also insane, my dad took a bite before I could take a photo but I digress. The ribs were perfect slightly spicy and so rich. I can't get over how amazing this dinner was. The mezcal negroni was absolutely delightful. I could have had many more. The bread pudding was like a great French toast turned into an amazing bread pudding and the ice cream went so well w it.",1
7324,"Tonight was our first time at The Purple Pig and it did not disappoint! It’s a small plate place made for sharing which we love. We had four dishes and left very satisfied. All of our dishes were excellent. Highly recommend the goat cheese, burrata and wagyu beef brisket. Service was excellent. We were seated quickly around 5 on Thursday although the place was pretty busy. Staff cleared our plates and provided new ones and kept our drinks full. All around - a great experience.",1
7325,"Here in Chicago for a vacation with my boyfriend - decided on this restaurant after looking around on Google Maps.

I have nothing to complain about, from food to service and atmosphere everything was utterly amazing.

The roasted bone marrow goes amazingly well with the house made bread.

Squid ink pasta was terrific.

Wine pairings were on point!",1
7326,"You have to go here.  Make reservations though.  This chef and his team make dishes deserving the J B award. This is the half duck dish. WOW. We sat at bar in front of the chef & cooks, watching so much delicious looking scallops- salmon - steak getting made… prices are good too.  A+.",1
7327,Fine dining food in a laid back atmosphere! The restaurant could be considered casual but the food very much not. We had the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and the Orchiette with Sausage. The pork was very tender and the gravy was amazing. The house made pasta is perfect and the pairing with the greens and sausage is surprising. Definitely make a reservation and come hungry.,1
7328,"THE BEST FILET MIGNON IVE EVER HAD!!. Perfect date night. The food here is beyond delicious. Everything from chicken, pasta, to steak feels like farm to table fresh. I could legit eat at this place everyday. Bonus points because it's located near the Chicago river walk so you can enjoy a relaxing walk after dinner. Extremely easy to travel to from the suburbs because spot hero parking is within 1 minute of the restaurant. This is a top 3 restaurant in Chicago.",1
7329,"It is the most AMAZING food ever tasted!! All dishes are submerged in beautiful sauces. It is truly a wonderful menu. All I can say is WOW!! I had Greek salad for starters, that was so fresh and different than I ever tasted. We had the tuna tartar to share. Oh my goodness, the tuna and its presentation was out of this world! My daughter had bone marrow and she thought they were the BEST she ever had and good portion. I had the halibut and it was so so fresh and delicious. My daughter had short rib raviollo that was submerged in delicious sauce and it was marvelous! For dessert, we had their famous and most fresh and delicious bread pudding w/ fresh apples and apple sauce, yumm!",1
7330,"Amazing food. The service was great. I have never gotten a refill on ice tea until today, which was also the best ice tea I have had in a while. The food was one of a kind and a must have experience. Highly recommend.",1
7331,"Good lord, this was so good. It was a pleasant experience from beginning to end, with exceptional service bringing out incredible food. We had (and would HIGHLY recommend) the scallops, the gnocchi, the tuna tartare and the arancini. We also had some very tasty bread pudding and the ricotta chocolate chip tart.

I would definitely recommend anyone in Chicago try out this (kinda) hidden gem.",1
7332,"A Mediterranean styled restaurant that serves lots of great options. My favorite dish was the mushroom 3 ways. I didn't know that mushrooms could taste this good.

Food
The mushroom 3 ways was the highlight dish of my meal. The mushrooms were cooked and sauted perfectly to bring out their flavor and texture.

I ordered the roasted bone marrow because I wanted to compare it to Au Cheval's bone marrow and I would have to say that Au Cheval's was more to my taste (I had Au Cheval earlier that day) . The bone marrow at Purple Pig was good but the side of salt was challenging because it would make it too salty. The greens were also overpowering and I could not taste the bone marrow at all.

Ravioletto was very good. The sauce was creamy but not too thick and everything blended together well. Don't be too surprised when sauce comes running out when you cut in!

Atmosphere
A nice upscale feel to it and bright inside. A medium noise level and comfortable seating.

Pricing
On the pricey side but worth the price the food. Bone marrow was more expensive here than at Au Cheval.

Service
Service was good and speedy. Made reservations for dinner at 5pm and got seated immediately.

Other
The entrance of the restaurant is inside the building on the 2nd or 3rd-ish floor.",1
7333,"We got to visit the bar area to grab a bite before heading to dinner and we’re so glad we stopped in! Our server was so nice, she made sure to check in with us to ensure we enjoyed both our drinks and the bites we got. The dishes themselves were really tasty, I thought they were pretty small portions but they’re also meant to be small bites. The bone marrow melted on the toast and combined with a parsley salad was delicious. The tuna was nice and cold and had to be my favorite of the two dishes!",1
7334,"Such a great restaurant. I ordered the roasted carrots, pork belly and bread pudding for dessert. Every dish was amazingly delicious. So well prepared and presentation was beautiful too. Would definitely come back again!",1
7335,"Amazing!!! The food was perfectly cooked! The wine list was great too.
They recommend us to order 3-4 different meals, and we choose the  : Tuna Tartare, Spanish Octopus, Pork Belly and Trio of mushroom with trufle. Only a small comment,  the place is a bit loud, but not an issue at all…This place is a must go on Chicago!",1
7336,"The Purple Pig was a fantastic spot for a lunchtime bite during my stay in Chicago. While they were very busy, I was able to walk in and grab two sets at the kitchen counter (which allowed us to watch how the food was made, definitely a nice experience). The food itself was outrageous, we ordered three items, which were all great.

Spanish Octopus (buttery, tender with an acidic spicy salsa that perfectly complemented it)
Squid Ink Chittara (amazing blend of flavor, cherry tomatoes were perfectly sweet)
Orecchiette (herbs added an earthy taste and was good but have had similar dishes elsewhere)

The pricing on the menu was fair, there aren’t many places where you are getting deals in the current environment so a delicious three dish meal for two, which left us quite full, didn’t seem unreasonable at $70. This is, without a doubt, a five star worthy meal and I hope anyone living/visiting Chicago takes the time to dine here.",1
7337,"The gin drinks are out of this world
Service is excellent we tried a variety of food, everything was impeccable. Not pictured is the pork belly which was also amazing . The beets with the combination of the goat cheese and pistachios…. I wish I had words. If I lived in Chicago, I would probably be here everyday !",1
7338,"I think this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I recommend the bone marrow to literally everyone - it’s genius. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad dish here. They have such creativity and flavor in every plate. The service is always great.  Desserts are wonderful, the cheese plates are wonderful, you really can’t go wrong.",1
7339,"Gastronomic paradise. Not my scene. Definitely interesting, but nothing memorable. They like to play with the food, but nothing was really executed in a manner that made me want to come back. Good to try once, but that’s it.",1
7340,"I heard a lot about this place, it was a first time we visited this restaurant.  The food was inventive and very flavorful, but a bit heavy on the butter. Bone marrow was tasty. Liked pork ribs which was melt in your mouth. Great ambience and service. Our waiter was very pleasant.",1
7341,Good food. Pork belly is delicious! Sweet condensed ice cream also delicious! Next time I would skip the coffee and eat another dessert.,1
7342,"My previous review was deleted somehow. Food was mediocre, cold, burnt, and not tasty whatsoever. The best part of the meal was probably the hummus, which says a lot because it’s hard to mess up hummus. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed and flustered. She also stated with our party of 4 none of our entrees would come out at the same time? Which is super awkward especially when you get your dinner 10 minutes before anyone else reviews theirs. This is unacceptable. Filet mignon was way undercooked, broccoli rabe was burnt. Very small portions. Really cannot believe I paid $60 dollars for the meal. My fiancées entree (pasta) was incredibly salty. Overall a bad experience. This is not a Michelin star restaurant. Michelin star restaurants are supposed to have superb service, spectacular, food, and a overall great experience. We got not of that. We also let our waitress know we were celebrating a engagement, which she did not seem to care. I do not recommend spending your money here.",0
7343,"Visited last night for dinner,  first time back since the move to the new location as I’m not a local.  Able to get a seat at the bar right away.  Benefits of traveling alone lol.

Bar tender recommend a few item,  as I have sampled the bone marrow before I thought I would try a few new things.

Started with the smoked pork tongue.  An amazing bite of food,  great flavor paired with pasta and hummus on the side.  Highly recommend this dish and please don’t think tongue think bacon but not fatty.

For dinner I had the Milk braised pork shoulder.  Such a great meal on a cold rainy night.  Shoulder pulled apart with a fork and paired with mashed potatoes and spinach.

I highly recommend this place when you are downtown Chicago",1
7344,"Thoroughly impressed.

Where to begin? Wow- really enjoyed this place. Went here on a whim and so thankful we did.

The restaurant is in a great location and has a casual, yet upscale atmosphere.  The service was attentive and friendly.

However, the star is surely the food.  Everything we had was perfectly prepared, beautifully presented, and delicious.  The  scallops were excellent, foie gras appetizer was rich and beautifully complimented by the grilled brioche bread.

The chicken kabobs were well prepared, though personally, I think they would have benefited from a spice rub before being cooked-  I think this would have added a nice layer of flavor- As well as adding fresh dill to the tiziki sauce— however, these are minor individual critiques.

The house cocktails were exceptionally balanced, unique, and generous.  The lavender fields, key lime sour, miso sour, and mezcal Negroni sour are more than enough of a reason to try this place.

This purple pig is a must try! Can’t wait to go back!",1
7345,Good music. Love the open kitchen. Everything that I saw coming out the kitchen looked amazing! Sat at the bar for dinner and ordered the milk braised Berkshire shoulder. Was melt in your mouth perfectly tender,1
7346,"The bone marrow was terrific. That mix of fat, acid, and freshness of the salad on top of the crunchy bread was spot on. The octopus was also nicely done. Good char and citrus mixed with pesto was 👌🏼",1
7347,"Busy restaurant even for a Monday lunch. At the beginning we were a little bit dissapointed that our dishes were rather small and the ravioletto didn’t taste as the promised truffle. But at the end the desserts were so so good, that this changed our opinion. The interior of the place left an impression on us also, with small cute details.",1
7348,"Because of the name, I never expected the restaurant to be this style. My sister brought us here and I’m so very glad she did. The food was executed perfectly and beautifully plated. Everything was amazingly delicious. Our waiter was professional and knowledgeable. And I loved the atmosphere. What an elegant experience. I highly recommend.",1
7349,"My experience at the Purple Pig does not seem to align with everyone else's. I hope if you ignore this review and go anyway your experience is better than mine.

I made a reservation about one to two months in advance. I checked in about thirty minutes early hoping to get on, understandably, I had to wait; so, I came back at my reservation and then had to continue to wait. The first table I was given was by the kitchen doors, so I asked for a central location.

Nian, the hostess, was more than nice enough to accommodate and got me located at a high top by the bar more centrally located.

The server in that area was a little abrupt. She was possibly overworked with too many tables. We felt like a bother to her and the whole experience seemed rushed.

The restaurant was incredibly cramped and very busy, but if all you care about is food then let's get to that detail.

The food was all premade. I don't mean it was packaged, but I mean it was cooked earlier in the day and kept on a heat lamp. I ordered the shoulder and it came out so fast I thought it was the wrong order and asked them to come back as it must have been a mistake.  It came on mashed potatoes, that were basically sloshed onto the plate.

I realize some items you prepare in advance as you may need to cook them over multiple days, but this was everything. There was not a single item served that was actually hot, although the plates were nice and toasty.

Now let's get into taste, I had the following items:
• Foie Gras and Port Tail Tartine
• Pork Liver and Bacon Pate
• Smoked Pork Tongue
• Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder
• Pork Jowl
• Grilled Broccoli

The three snacks were delicious and flavorful, the two mains were abysmal, and the sides were not memorable.

Typically pork shoulder is a fatty cut, but this particular piece was basically grease. You can see from my picture the grease and oil covering the plate.

The Jowl was prepared like something you'd get from a Denny's. It was basically just slapped onto some bread.

Overall I do not recommend coming here. Chicago has too many good places to make this a pick.  if you're visiting and only have a limited number or days.

This would be one star, but I will give it a two star as the cocktails were good, Nian was accommodating, and the appetizers were good.",0
7350,"Food is great here, especially the tuna tartare. I ordered lavender fields and it was delicious. The only complaint was the service. We have to ask for the server since he never stopped by to greet us. He took our order and didn’t bother to come back to check on us until the end of the meal, we have to ask for him again since we need our check.",0
7351,"The best tuna tartare I’ve had, with fun plating. Cool atmosphere, and waiter was friendly and helpful. Fillet mignon was honestly kinda dry, I asked for medium rare but it was more like medium—but the cream sauce was fantastic.",1
7352,"The Purple Pig undoubtedly lives up to its hype and high reviews. Absolutely amazing food, the way the flavors and textures all complimented each other made each bite a true delight. We had the following dishes to share amongst a group of 4 of us and it was the perfect amount to eat:
Roasted carrots - amazing, a mix of mustard seeds, dates and a delicious glaze
Octopus - FLAVOR EXPLOSION, the salsa verde was amazing + the asparagus pairing was to die for
Mushroom 3 ways ; delicious!
Pork belly; the glaze was delicious and the meat inside was so smooth it melted in your mouth, while the outer layer was nice and crunchy
Chicken skewers were not my favorite, would not recommend there are better menu items
Ravioletta; with mushroom truffle, we were about to remove from our order and thankfully the waiter mentioned its one of their most unique offerings, and he was not wrong. Was easily the crowd favorite
Squid ink pasta - don’t think it’s worth ordering here was not their specialty
Crème brule ; smooth texture and the espresso ice cream was delicious
Couldn’t recommend this restaurant more, a must try!
Also the waiter mentioned they’re also known for their tuna tar tar which we regretted not getting so would recommend as well!",1
7353,"Came here for dinner with coworkers, and it was phenomenal! Service was very efficient, and the food was as good as if not better than when they were in their former location.

We loved the braised pork shoulder so much we ordered it a second time! The fois gras and charcuterie are great for starters, and the orecchiette was exactly the same texture as they make it in Puglia although these are much larger in size! Highly recommend!",1
7354,"Excelente experience we went for lunch the atmosphere it’s lovely, menu options and plates are awesome and delicious. Each plate presentation it’s gorgeous. Service good, but all the time they are checking on you that some time you would like to be less ask …. And enjoy more the food and the company that answering the waitress…. But life isn’t perfect. Price it’s average for downtown Chicago. Highly recommended  !!",1
7355,"All the food was great! I forgot to snap a picture of the Hummus + Focaccia but man was that bussin! Chicken and waffles were pretty good came with some hot sauce that gave it some jazz. Drink was good as well, quite big so I was pretty tired afterwards. I did not try the cauliflower but my dad said it was great! Our server was great, was jovial and welcoming.",1
7356,Our second visit and the food again was outstanding!!! Eriberto took great care of us at the bar. So hard to decide in what to order since everything in the menu is amazing,1
7357,"Recommendation: Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder

Do not recommend: Crispy Pig’s Ear

This restaurant is less than 15 mins walking from the cloud gate.

We did not make reservation so we were seated at the bar. We came around 6:15 p.m. and there was no line to wait.

The pro for this restaurant is that you have rich options to try different parts of pigs such as liver, ears, shoulder, and pork belly. The problem is that it might be novel for others but not for me. My hometown has even richer options like foot, brain, tail...

The Smoked Pork Tongue is marinated with sugar which makes it special. Foie Gras Torchon serves as code dish with bread. Personally the foie gras we tried yesterday at Au Cheval tastes better. Tuna Tartare has an Elder(nope) ring with tartare at the bottom. It has truffle in it.

Personal favorite is Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder. I was worried that the meat could be dried-up and then tough. But no, not at all. The pork is tender and soft. The mashed potatoes taste like silk.

Do NOT order Crispy Pig’s Ear. As a lover of braised pig ears, I am disappointed by this dish. Pig's ears itself have the crunchy bites due to the soft bones in it. For this dish, the fried part dominates the taste. It tastes more like fries other than pig's ears.

Desser is Sicilian Iris. The outer part is fried and hot. Be careful that do not touch it with hands.",1
7358,"I love the options here.  There are unique items on the menu like pork tongue, foie gras and pig ears just to name a few.  Out of everything I tried the Squid Ink Chittara was my favorite.  The spaghetti alla chitarra is the perfect selection for this dish and catches just the right amount of the sauce.  The dish is completed with a medley of seafood with scallops highlighting the dish.  I hope they keep that dish on the menu long term.

I really appreciate them pushing the envelope which results in a menu with a vast amount of options.  I’ll definitely be coming back to try all the other things I missed out on.",1
7359,Food was excellent. Ambiance and restaurant design could have been more interesting - felt like a restaurant in a mall or hotel. Food made up for it. Definitely recommend.,1
7360,"The entire experience was absolutely amazing.  The staff was quite friendly and ver knowledgeable about the entire menu items and recommendations. We had the “Winter salad “ followed by the special which was a Seared Mediterranean Sea Bass, Braised Fennel, Grapefruit, Green Olives + Citrus Sauce… flavor was so intense… along with their Veal Breast
Swiss Chard, Fregola, Cipolinni Onions, Mushrooms, Polenta…. Very tender…",1
7361,"the purple Pig is always a must stop when downtownZ they are always packed but the food is amazing. The chefs there do such a great job of cranking out exceptionally high quality food. I started with the 3 sample charcuterie plate with 7 year aged cheddar, serrano ham, and prosciutto. The blends of all three paired with the various additional condiments created a ton of variety. Especially one that seemed to be caramelized and peanut based. I had the pork shoulder which was mouth melting without being too fatty. Paired with a well seasoned gravy and mashed potatoes. Perfection. To finish up, I was presented with smooth sorbet and fresh waffle adornment.",1
7362,"Second time visiting The Purple Pig. I made it a point to visit them first in my culinary trip to Chicago. Did not disappoint.

Croquettes
Chicken and Pork + Tzatziki - very well cooked. Fried to perfection. A little bit of the tzatziki sauce would be enough. Too much can over take the palate and break the balance. It can become too sour or bitter. I was not able to

Pork Belly
Ginger Glaze, Carrot, Espresso + Frisée- tender pork,  perfection in every bite. At the center, the right amount of moisture. The pork belly showed a great amount of patience and someone who has attempted to bring attention to detail onto the table. Simplicity and an explosion of flavor. The pickled carrots taste just right.

Beer:
DOVETAIL
Helles Munich Lager | Illinois - smooth, pale, very pleasant to drink. Soothe the stomach and satisfy the soul.",1
7363,"Popped in for lunch. Nice location, servers were very attentive, overall nice ambiance.  One of the best carrot soups I experienced.",1
7364,"Oops. Would have taken better pictures but I accidentally could not wait because all of the food was so good! Perfect sharing portions and I'd definitely recommend getting the burrata, the whipped feta, the roasted beets, and the chicken thighs. All were creative and tasty and we really enjoyed all of the flavors!",1
7365,"After hearing many recommendations, we came here for lunch on a Saturday without a reservation, so there was a bit of a wait. It was a warm and inviting setting. After a while, we were seated at the bar and watched the bartender crank out drinks. Once we ordered, the food came pretty quickly.

$17 Pork Liver & Bacon Paté - fried sage + grape mostarda:
Thick cut slices of bread with a small ramekin of smokey, tangy, sweet pate. The crunchy sage was a great topping too.

$29 Spanish Octopus - green beans, potatoes + salsa verde:
Meaty pieces of charred octopus, very lightly tossed in salsa verde

$15 Charred Cauliflower - cornichon, parsley + toasted breadcrumbs:
Wonderfully roasted cauliflower florets. The breadcrumbs added crunch and parsley gave it a fresh aroma, though the cornichons were a bit overpowering.

$23 Milk Braised Berkshire Pork Shoulder - mashed potatoes, gravy + crispy lentils:
The star meat and potato dish of the day, with very tender pork shoulder smothered in gravy, over creamy mashed potatoes, delicious!

To accompany our dishes, we also had a glass of grenache and the Corpse Reviver - Aviation gin, Cocchi Americana, Orange Curacao, lemon + absinthe. With so many options on the menu, I would probably come back for the terrine, or duck dish, or the homemade pastas.",1
7366,We really enjoyed our meal there. I think that the hummus dish is probably the best one I ever had. They out something magical in it that we couldn't stop eating. The pasta and chicken ragu was delicious..I wanted three of the desserts they were so good. We had the creamy silky smooth brulee of pumpkin. I am looking forward to my next visit.,1
7367,"A must-go dining experience for those visiting Chicago or living here, the purple pig is a classic restaurant. The concept is that almost every item on the menu uses part of the pig. I’d highly recommend the veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots), pork belly and pork ribs, and burrata!",1
7368,"The food here at the Purple Pig was a 10/10. My wife and I tried the bone marrow (SUPURB), pork liver pate, tuna tartare and the mushrooms. We enjoyed all the dishes tremendously. The only minor complaint I would have was that the tables were literally stacked right on top of each other, so we could hear the entire conversation of the couple sitting right next to us. But I get it, they need to maximize space to accommodate all the people who want to eat this delicious food. We will certainly come back to the Purple Pig when we come back to Chicago.",1
7369,Such as amazing time. Absolutely fabulous food and servers. We enjoyed every second here. I am highly recommending this restaurant specially if you like pork. If I can I will give 6 stars for sure. Enjoy!,1
7370,"Food is very good. Duck was roasted perfectly! Solid wine selection, especially by the glass. Plenty of pairing options. Enjoy and drink good people!",1
7371,"Every time I come to chicago this place was fully booked. But this time I booked it on month in advanced to give it a try.
so we had rib, octopus and duck.
Rib was too saucy and it was a bit sweet.
Octopus was grilled but dry and salty.
Duck was dry as well",1
7372,"The bone marrow is really good and the bread is perfect. The pork belly and the short rib are Ok, would not eat that again. The risotto that comes with the rib is not really a risotto and I hated that they said it was, even the rice is wrong. The desert is not special, probably not worth the calories.",1
7373,"An outstanding restaurant. Shared plates that were out of this world. I definitely suggest the bone marrow plate, sounds yucky but oh so delicious. The ribs were falling off the bone, tender, not overly covered in BBQ sauce and most. Definitely worth the wait to be seated.",1
7374,"Had one of the best salmon dinners of my entire life, served in minutes after I ordered. The iced tea was delicious as well? I wish I remembered the name of the bartender/server that waited on me, but she was fantastic! Highly recommend",1
7375,"Sometimes I still dream about that bone marrow... honestly picked this place out of a hat/wandering around looking at photos on Google maps of nearby restaurants and hit jack pot! We had the bone marrow, squid ink pasta, Spanish octopus and the beets and goat cheese and 10/10 recommend all of it I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Also they had great mocktails!!",1
7376,"I wanted to love the Purple Pig but while it was a very good meal, it wasn't as exceptional as I'd anticipated. You're more likely to get the most out of this restaurant if you're dining with others and share plates. I was traveling solo this time and as such, only had the opportunity to sample a few items. My first course, the Pan Seared Foie Gras, Lambrusco Ice Cream, Blueberry Crumble + Raspberry Sauce was a wonderful start. The presentation was lovely, the fois gras was seared beautifully and the fruity raspberry sauce was the perfect compliment to the richness of the dish. The ice cream presented more as a berry sorbet but it was outstanding and the acidity cut the richness perfectly. The portion of fois gras was unfortunately on the skimpy side while the crumble took over the plate and didn't really contribute greatly to the overall texture/flavor profile. I should have gone with a lighter second course but I'm a huge fan of Osso Bucco marrow so I couldn't resist trying the Roasted Bone Marrow, Herbs, Capers, Onions + Maldon Sea Salt. It was however, underwhelming. The bone marrow was flavorless, missing that unctuous nuttiness that I had hoped for. Instead, it was merely fatty with no seasoning on it to draw the flavor out. A sprinkle of the sea salt did nothing to retrieve what was lacking. The parsley salad was a nice touch but I was left wishing I'd ordered something else from the tempting menu. I finished out with the Bread Pudding, not the most creative option but enjoyable in that ""comfort food"" kind of way.",1
7377,"Par if any.  pork belly was too sweet, ribs were drenched in sauce that's not salty or spicy, bone marrow was cold and not so spreadable. Only dish that was note worthy was spanish octopus",0
7378,"Well, I ate here twice today! It was that good!! Tadhg was our server tonight and he made our experience wonderful. The food is great and the drinks were the best we had ever had. But at the end of the day the server makes or breaks the night and he really made it special for us.",1
7379,"This was my first visit to The Purple Pig.  Attention!!!  To find this restaurant, you must enter the office building 444 N Michigan Ave.  From the moment you enter, you can feel the atmosphere of a very pleasant place.  Great menu and food even better.  I really like this idea of ​​sharing more dishes.  You can taste more types of food this way.  I am very satisfied with the very fast and professional service.  I will definitely be back to taste the next dishes.",1
7380,"Amber our waitress was friendly kind to us senior
We had lots of Starter ..love the foie..we can't have it in california.food was yummy  from the fried pig ears to the roasted broccoli 🥦 it was just perfect thanks to your kitchen staff..your bus boys keep the water flowing..we couldn't asked for a better lunch.. thanks again everyone was excellent",1
7381,"Tried this place out of the blue and my god what an experience! Everything is delicious, just order anything with your eyes closed. The service is great, but food is just too good. Definitely coming back for more! Get the Pork Belly!!

Update: went back 2nd time and did not have the same experience 😖. Waiter was okay and not detailed. We tried other options on the menu, except bone marrow spread, everything was a little subpar. Bread was not soft, meats outside of pork may not be a good fit. Still would say worth a visit. But stick to pork entrees and vegetable apps.",1
7382,Totally worth it. Pork shoulder and tongue were outstanding. You need to make a reservation in advance or else be prepared to wait 1h+,1
7383,"The food was okay. Even though the portion sizes were generous, the dishes were mediocre in flavor or over salted. Every dish we ordered was soaked in butter or oil. The bread that came with the bone marrow and ""whipped chickpeas"" (aka hummus) was heavily buttered, overpowering any other flavor. The sweet corn was probably the lightest of all the dishes we tried, and even that was swimming in oil. The Italian sausage in the orchiette pasta was so salty it was inedible. The ravioletto tasted only like brown butter; neither the truffle, rosemary or garlic were detectable. Of the seven dishes we ordered, we were only happy with two- the fried pork ear and half duck. Even then, the yogurt sauce and roe that accompanied the duck didn't enhance the dish or make it taste any better. The duck would have been better served over plain rice with plain roasted vegetables, to be honest.

Dining in was also disappointing because of how loud the restaurant is. I had to yell for anyone to hear me immediately across the table. Overall, this place is underwhelming, and I'd be reluctant to return in the future. I wish I could've spent my $150 elsewhere tonight",1
7384,"I'm in heaven!!! I love pork!  This is so much more!  The dishes coming from the line are amazing in smell and presentation.  The beets are fantastic!  I don't know what I like better... the sprinkling of pastashios or the swipe of pastashio butter running down the plate (licking of plate may be hard not to do)... or is the whipped feta (disclaimer I don't normally like feta).  I know it's mouth watering! Now for my main, pork belly!!!!  OK.... this may be the best pork belly I've ever had.   I love pork belly (sorry Charlotte🐽) the carrot and parsley salad made by the cutest and maybe shortest 😀) line cook was the perfect match!",1
7385,"The food was par excellence, with wonderful presentation to boot. The drinks were also well made. The duck was a personal highlight. As one might expect for a restaurant of this style, the prices are high and the portions are small, but it's worth the experience on a special occasion.",1
7386,"🎑Ambience/Service: bustling upscale pub vibes, no outdoor seating but super cozy environment and friendly staff! Reservations highly recommended this place fills up!
🍱Presentation: so artsy and colorful, from the drinks to the food!!!
😋Taste: the ravioletto is something to behold, if youre a truffle lover you really get the bang for your buck, the taste is INSANE, especially when mixed in with ricotta. The tuna tartare is quality and a HUGE portion, amazing with the cracker ring and avocado! The corn salad veggie option is SO fresh and crunchy, love the basil in it! The bone marrow pork chop was cooked perfectly and was so buttery and amazing, I was obsessed with the onions it came with! The Greek salad was a solid starter (we preferred it without the olives they added a bitter aftertaste), and their hibiscus spritz was beautiful and tasted refreshing and fun!! ALSO, their wine list is amaaaaazing! We tried the Croatian wine it was chef’s kiss!
💰Price/Quality: $$-$$$ but SO WORTH IT SERIOUSLY. If you havent been this is your sign!
🤩 Standout factor: come here for amazing food AND wines! This spot has been one of my top 3 restaurants in Chicago for as long as Ive been dining in Chi, a major reason being everything I’ve ordered has been a delicious and solid choice, nothing disappoints EVER! I find myself wanting to come back again and again to try the entire menu AND re-order the same food, which is very rare for me! The chef adds such a unique twist to his dishes that you just can’t find  anywhere else !",1
7387,"It was very delicious!!

Dinner in Chicago left a lasting impression on me. The taste was good and the staff was very nice. Thank you.",1
7388,"Great restaurant in downtown Chicago. All dishes I ordered were pretty impressive in terms of tastes and appearances. If I were to be a little picky then things are a little salty here, but otherwise excellent.",1
7389,"The service started off on the wrong foot. We waited 20 minutes after sitting down before I had to ask a bus boy to have a waiter come and take our order. We ordered my son's food along with the appetizer so that he could start eating first. However, they forgot about his meal. It took longer for his meal than even my wife's main course. Total of 45 minutes for ravioli that once we asked ""what was taking so long?"", it arrived immediately. They did not charge us for his food to make up for it. We ordered two appetizers, and three main dishes. The food was okay, but nothing great and we ended up feeling like the meal was not worth the price. We've been to quite a few nice restaurants with pricey dishes and have paid about the same for higher quality food and slightly larger portions. The atmosphere is better for large groups and friends rather than family with kids. Too loud and crowded. It wasn't a horrible experience but it wasn't what we expected based on the reviews and word of mouth from friends.",1
7390,"We had an amazing experience dining here.  Everything we ordered was delicious but our group agreed the beets may be the best beets any of us have ever had.  I also highly recommend the wild mushrooms.  The meat and cheese platters are a great start.

The ambiance is calm and understated.   The staff was friendly, courteous, and kind.  We were able to start conversations that felt very natural.

Overall this was a wonderful dining experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant.",1
7391,"If you are looking for uniqueness and exquisite cousine in downtown Chicago, this is a great option.
Spanish Octopus cooked to perfection with green beans, potatoes in a base of special salsa verde; mussels in a special red tomato based sauce with a touch of spicy and we closed with the pear tart.
All was great!!
In the menu, you will find the suggestion about the ideal wine to partner each option.",1
7392,"We had THE BEST experience with Tadhg tonight. We actually ate here twice today because it was so tasty. Best experience, best food, and the absolute best cocktails I’ve ever had. 10/10 would recommend this restaurant and will be back every time we’re in Chicago! The food was delicious but honestly Tadhg made the entire experience, we wish we could be friends with him!!",1
7393,First visit in 5 years. Quite a different location and atmosphere but food was just as fine. Tapas-style dining with each dish an exquisite experience. We had 4 courses and 2 glasses of wine each. Started with a 2 cheese one meat charcuterie board then the shrimp and avocado salad. Main dish was the (huge) Scallops and ended with tiramasu. Each dish delicious. Attentive service even during a busy time. Highly recommend.,1
7394,"Great atmosphere and was busy at lunchtime on a Thursday, so a reservation is recommended. A little pricey—one entree, vegetable, cocktail, and beer was $83, despite smaller tapas-sized portions. If you want to get the most for your money, the vegetable portions were more generous than the (pricier) entrees. We had the cauliflower and rabbit special. The cauliflower was great, a unique style served with gherkin pickles.",1
7395,"Had the lamb and the Sicilian Iris. Both were amazing. Lamb was tender, sauce was full of flavor and veggies were cooked perfectly.

The star was the Sicilian Iris. It’s like a fried cannoli. Amazed by this dish and the cream is just how mom makes it.

Jake was a great host too and makes the experience so much better. Seek him out when you go!  Ask about his Harley Davidson motorcycles. 😄

10/10 will go again.",1
7396,"Good restaurant but not amazing. I tried the Arancini, crispy pig ears, pork ribs, pork belly and pork jawl. I only recommend the last one. Staff is not awful but not good either. To me it is overrated.",0
7397,"Quite a pretentious place, with a pretense of haute cuisine. The service is top notch, although there was an unpleasant moment when, with an existing table reservation for 2 people, it turned out to be a problem to seat another one (despite the fact that all tables are designed for 4 people).  However, with the help of managers, the problem was solved. Number of dishes is very complex, with complex sauces, etc., but nevertheless, the whole impression is good.",1
7398,"Come with friends and come hungry.  Every dish was delicious, well-crafted, and unique.  Seats at the chef’s counter allows you to watch the magic of the kitchen.",1
7399,Best meal I had in Chicago and it was just for a quick appetizer & cocktail. We sat at the bar and the service was perfect. The Tuna Tartare is like nothing I’ve seen or eaten before - absolutely gorgeous & so tasty. The bacon wrapped shrimps were also stellar!,1
7400,"Delicious food: pork belly, bone marrow, and mushrooms.
Great service too!",1
7401,Smaller shareable plates with unique flavors. Great for groups of people. The burrata was especially good as was the hummus. The halibut was okay.,1
7402,"A group of 6 of us came and shared many dishes together, below are some of the things we really liked. Everyone found dishes that they were really excited about on the menu.

The pork belly in particular stood but because it was so tender and flavorful but not too heavy. Every dish was very tasty, nicely presented and perfect for sharing.

Service was very fast and the waiters always came at a good time for plate changes and to offer more coffee and drinks - highly recommend!",1
7403,"Worth every penny. Do yourself a favor and order the Bread For The Table as an appetizer. It comes as a variety of house made crackers, rolls and cornbread paired with the most delicious truffle butter I think I’ve ever had. For drinks we started with the Hemingway Daiquiri and Paper Plane, both of which were tasty and strong. So glad we took our waiter’s advice and ordered the special which was Rabbit Loin Wrapped in Bacon-it was phenomenal to say the least. Then we ordered the Pork Belly which was so tender and juicy. We also ordered the drink special which I sadly don’t remember the name of but it matched perfectly with our meal and enhanced all the flavors. We rounded out our experience with the lemon tart which was enjoyably tangy and the perfect end to a perfect meal. We can’t wait to come back!!!",1
7404,"I’ll admit it, I’m picky.  I dislike when I see truffle and pork belly and hamburgers on the menu, this place was excellent.   The desserts were grand the service spectacular.  A must visit in Chicago.",1
7405,Everything positive that’s said about this place it’s true. Service was divine as was the food. Please get the ahi tuna with the homemade cracker. It’s been two weeks and I’m still thinking about it.,1
7406,"Ordered pork shoulder, pork belly, and octopus. Octopus was good although sauce was a bit too tangy for me. Pork shoulder and pork belly was very tender, so if you are ordering one, make sure to order something crunchy or chewy to compliment that. Server seems a bit rushed though and took dishes that we were working on.",1
7407,The food was delicious and the service was excellent! We tried four dishes today and can't wait to come back to try more.,1
7408,Absolutely delicious meal at the purple pig. On top of having outstanding and very attentive staff - we will definitely be back here to share another meal.,1
7409,I had the fried pig ear chunks and the salmon dinner. Both were absolutely delicious and offered up some great flavors.  Each came with a nicely paired glass of wine which I enjoyed as well. While I was there by myself I was able to meet others which created some interesting conversations.  Gladly go back when I am in town again,1
7410,"Great service. Nice, attentive staff. Amazing food. Slightly higher prices but also bigger portions. The tuna tartare was delicious as was the octopus.",1
7411,"I haven't been so amused with a restaurant before in my life.
I think I had the best experience eating. The selection of food was superb. It was so awesome that I can come back again and again. One of the best restaurants that I have tried. Very mouth-watery. Definitely, a place to relax and feel at home.
The staffs were so friendly and very accommodating. They were very attentive in every detail that I gave them.
They respect privacy of every customer. Very cozy and the food will never disappoint you. The place is very clean and follow health standards, since it's pandemic.
The overall service was excellent. I am a very satisfied customer and I will recommend The Purple Pig to all of my friends.
Especially those who are looking for relaxing place and great ambience. So, what are you waiting for? Let's dig in!",1
7412,The food was AMAZING. The only thing that topped the food was our server. I'm not sure exactly what his name was but I believe it was Tai(Thai)? Excellent sense of humor and kept us entertained the entire time. HIGHLY recommend the 1/2 duck and the pork belly. I found this place from a recommendation from a friend but now I'll be recommending it to my friends. The picture is of one of their starters (roasted bone marrow w/bread also recommended),1
7413,"Food was good, but salty :( try lessening it, so i wont get kidney stones.",1
7414,Amazing! Food was fantastic! Great atmosphere and service! Drinks were delicious!,1
7415,"Whiskey tasting and plates of shared food was all so delicious. Very friendly and efficient wait staff. Great atmosphere. Thought it would be touristy as it's on the Magnificent Mile, but seemed to be a mix of locals and visitors like us to the city. Was there on a Friday first reservation at 11am and it was packed by 12. It will be on our recommendation list.",1

7417,I really enjoyed the Purple Pig! I never had anything like it. The 1st time i have tried bone marrow and blood sausage. They were different. Not bad but different. The servers were all amazing and the managers. The atmosphere was very calm. I would highly recommend but it is a little pricey but it’s all about the experience for me.,1
7418,Love this place! Definitely must try! The service superb. Food is awesome.,1
7419,"A letdown, on all fronts.

Ordered two wines, a starter of humus and house-made focaccia, then mushrooms, then pasta, then scallops.

Everything came out of order and ice cold. Got mushrooms then starter then wine then scallops then pasta.

House-made focaccia was actually Texas toast (buttered whites bread) and the mushrooms had sat for at least 15
Minutes before they hit our table. Scallops were the only decent dish. Timing of plates and wine was terrible.

Worst of all, server never came by once during entire slow meal. We repeatedly asked other backwaiting staff for help.

Just a really disappointing experience.",0
7420,"Because this restaurant is one of the most well-known in the area, I make it a point to eat here whenever I'm in town. This is because I want to try the dishes that are so well-known that they frequently appear in online and offline media. I have always been curious as to what it is about this restaurant that makes reservations so difficult than other restaurants. That’s why I decided that we should celebrate our anniversary in this location, and thankfully, my boyfriend was on board with the idea.
After a long wait, we were finally able to enter, and as soon as we did, we were blown away by the interior as well as the atmosphere that it created, even in the lobby. The staff is also extremely helpful and accommodating, and they make sure to take care of our needs at all times. Because of this, we have a wonderful time spending the evening here. We decided to try some of their most well-known dishes, such as their Salt Roasted Beets, Turkey Leg Confit, and Grilled Broccoli, as well as some of their specialty cocktails. And every one of these things is absolutely deserving of a try. This restaurant has my absolute highest praise and comes very highly recommended.",1
7421,"Just wow. This place is amazing! We ordered 10+ dishes and they were all out of this world. We were expecting good, but this was some amazing flavors.

From liver to mushrooms to sardines to ribs this place was a culinary odyssey. Awesome ingredients, fresh and pleasant tastes that were somehow familiar and not overpowering in any way.

There were so many ways the loud and busy atmosphere could have been overwhelming and distracting, but it worked for this place. It was fun, busy, and very quick. The chef was on top of his game and the servers were top notch. Bus boys were everywhere and quick to act.

All around, this was great and highly recommend it.",1
7422,Haven’t been here in over 6 years and it’s not as good as I remembered. Pork jowl was very salty. Restaurant still got cool vibes though.,1
7423,"I stopped by here on a trip to Chicago. I’ve heard good things about about the food so I thought I would give it a try. I was traveling alone so I sat at the bar. The service at the bar was informative but very impersonal. My server was clearly going through the motions. Anytime a server is unenthusiastic and tells me what the “best sellers” are I’m underwhelmed by them at best. So, this contributed to the 4 star rating. I love a good GSM wine so I ordered the one option they had on the menu and it was pretty decent. As for the food, I went with the pork shoulder (a best seller as stated by my server ) and was satisfied with the flavor and how it was prepared. It was very tender and barely needed a knife to cut through it. It was served with some very creamy mashed potatoes and some crunchy bits on top. It was a little salty for my taste (another reason for the 4 stars) but when I paired it with my wine it was SO MUCH BETTER. The wine really made the difference and made it a really tasty meal, I recommend the pairing (FYI, I included a pic in the review). Over all I would come back and try some other options on the menu. The menu definitely had some other interesting item I would like to try.",1
7424,"Because we had rented a home close owing to work, my friend and I had strolled past here a few times. Then, on our final night, we made the decision to go to this place and give it a go. Since there were so many people around, we waited for around 15 minutes for a seat to become available. We were not completely standing, because their wonderful staff had a chair waiting for us at the bar, just in front of the kitchen. It was ideal for passing the time while waiting.

We had two courses, and there was enough of food - we were satiated but not overly so. The tagliatelle with squid ink, which was rather nice, The pig belly, which had a terrific taste and was the most tender pork belly I've ever had, came next on the menu. The portion sizes were likewise rather large.

Overall, it meets up to the expectations. If you have the opportunity, I strongly advise you to make reservations and visit.",1
7425,This is one of the best salmon I have ever had. This is an amazing place!!!!! I will definitely come back again,1
7426,"The food was amazing first of all. But honestly I've been to a million restaurants and the server assistant John I think his name was. Is with out a doubt the best server assistant I've ever seen. This guy was cleaning tables quickly, waters constantly refilled on a bunch of different tables, restocking glasses.
Also the duck, short rib, and bone marrow are just next level delicious. 10/10 would highly recommend",1
7427,"A regular stop on the Chicago food circuit.  The Purple Pig has a great new location and fun atmosphere!  Their shared plates are delicious and hearty (3 to 4 make a good lunch), and the staff is efficient. We tried to get a reservation online at the last minute, and there was nothing available: but we called and they got us right in so don't just rely on the reservation link on the website.",1
7428,"Wow!!! Just Wow!!! What an amazing place.  Love the ambiance, service, drinks and good.  The Wagyu Short Rub was amazing.  A must go to in Chicago.",1
7429,"It was a good experience, I heard a lot of positive comments about the place, but like the vast majority of restaurants around here, they put a lot of pressure on you to choose your order quickly and spend as little time as possible in the place, this made my experience a little frustrating, but no stop going for it!",1
7430,"First time coming out to Chicago since the pandemic.  Great food.  Adults' favorite was the mushroom 3 ways.  My kids loved the bread, and gnocchi with pork neck.  We also had pig ears, octopus,  and the pork belly(it was tender,  but the taste is not as unique as I hoped).   All great!",1
7431,"Went to this restaurant while traveling. Ordered bone marrow, crispy pig ear, cauliflower and pork shoulder. Really recommend pork shoulder as it’s so soft, almost melting in the mouth. Not a big fan of pig ear since it’s too deep-fried and I couldn’t even recognize that, and you feel greasy very soon.",1
7432,"The purple pig has something for everyone.  My wife loves veggies,  I love all the Meats.  They have a great mix of more adventurous posts as well as classic comfort food. I love this place and the atmosphere.  Drinks are good and bartenders are very attentive",1
7433,"Delicious food, with nice presentations. Great service. Highly recommend it",1
7434,"My additional two cents worth of reviewing can only add to the chorus. Just fabulous food, drinks, and attention from Angela. Do not miss this place!",1
7435,"The food is very tasty. Fancy, looks very elegant. Plus, a different flavor palette in one dish gave me a gastrorgasm :) who knew that pistachio butter and beets can create that?! 🤣
We ordered roasted beets, hummus and duck. All five, but we did not like the bread at all. Too oily and weird spongy texture.",1
7436,"Great food! Great ambience! The service was a little bit off for we had to ask 3 different people to give us what we needed however, overall, the experience was amazing! Their pig ears, bone marrow and pork belly is the bomb! 🔥 Will definitely come back for more of their exciting dishes! Highly recommend! 🥳",1
7437,"Got brunch with my boyfriend when it opened at 11am and were seated inside right away. We got the fried manchego and the pork ribs. The manchego was like an upscale mozzarella stick and quite tasty with the sauce.

The ribs were definitely something special though — fall off-the-bone, tangy BBQ taste. I especially liked the lemon ricotta-type smear that went along with it (tasted like a dessert with the ribs!). Highly recommend going and getting the ribs!",1
7438,Everything in here is delicious. The pork meat was really soft and it falls of the bone. Also desserts were really good.,1
7439,"I had a trip to Chicago and was staying near by and thought to try this place. I had the Spanish octopus and it was one of the best things I ate in Chicago! It was so delicious, it has green beans and a citrus green sauce that really complimented the dish. The octopus was done perfectly, can’t wait to go back and have it again!",1
7440,"We were excited to try this restaurant based on all the good reviews, but it wound up just being ok, not amazing. We were there at 9 PM on a Friday and called ahead to see if we could get a seat. They said all reservations were full but the bar is first come first served. When we arrived, there were several tables open but we went for the bar anyway. Service was friendly but we were largely ignored; this isn't one of those places where the bartender gives advice on what to eat or local tips. The food was small plates but at entree prices, making this an expensive choice. The hummus & focaccia was good but not enough bread. The pasta dish I got was basically one big ravioli. How does one even share that? The drink menu was extensive but I was surprised that while they had a non alcoholic rose, they didn't have any NA beer, even though the Grüvi brand makes a lot of beer options.",1
7441,"Phenomenal. Go here. I come to Chicago once a month and have eaten a lot of places..trust me when I say: this place is superb. I had ravioli with chestnuts…I wasn’t even expecting to like them. They were delicious, inventive and a fun dinner experience for all of us. Book in advance.",1
7442,"Yes, go here. Trust me.

I'd been debating where to go for a last meal and few drinks as part of a weekend getaway in Chicago, and this was totally the right choice. Nice spot with a good vibe, *excellent* menu and some respectable cocktails.

The best experience is probably going as a group and getting a few things to share because everything on the menu looks so good, but I was very happy even just stopping in on my own.

I'd say it's worth going out of your way to check it out.",1
7443,"I am a big beet fan, my partner less so. The salted beets are SENSATIONAL. We also got a cheese board and yummy pork belly. After all the pizza and Italian beef, we felt GREAT walking around after. Really delicious, refreshing meal to mix it up.",1
7444,Second time here but the food was overall extremely delicious and well plated. I’d heavily recommend the bone marrow or any of their pork dishes.,1
7445,"The food was delicious, it’s an experience! All the staff was really friendly, including the chef!",1
7446,"We did not have a reservation, but were told we could sit at the bar. It took a while to get our order in, but the food came quickly. It is modern Mediterranean. The food was very good, but very small portions. We had a starter & 2 entrees and it came to just under $100. The best part was the starter of homemade foccacia bread with hummus.",1
7447,"The reviews on this place are always awesome so we had to try it when in town. Dinner was amazing. Love that they serve sharable plates. Halibut and mozzarella was so good.  I don’t have a single complaint about this place and I’m looking forward to going back.

This definitely isnt a cheap dinner but totally worth it.",1
7448,My favourite restaurant in Chicago. Fantastic choice of wines . Food very good . Duck and broccoli are special,1
7449,The Purple Pig is a fantastic restaurant! The plates are shareable so friends can sample each other's choices. The food is fresh and the ingredients are simple. The wine list is substantial but not overwhelming. Staff is welcoming and helpful. No trip to Chi-town is complete without a meal at The Purple Pig!,1
7450,This is the place to go when visiting chicago. Pricey but good. I actually went twice. Make your reservation way ahead. It gets really busy,1
7451,Lets talk about the Purple Pig. What an incredible place aside for the amazing food the service is next level. I made a reservation almost a month ago and as luck would have it my flight was delayed over 3 hours. When I landed I knew I wasnt going to be on time so I called and spoke to Antonio. Not only did he hold the reservation for me he was there to great us upon arrival. From this point my bad day turned into an amazing night. The service warmth and hospitality was beyond description. The food was amazing the service was first class and the warmth was spectacular. I 100% recommended this place and want to thank Antonio for being the amazing person that he is. Book your reservation in advance and enjoy the food.,1
7452,"First time being here and it was quite the impression. Wonderful atmosphere, great service, and phenomenal food. I ordered the pork chop and honestly... the BEST pork chop I've had, hands down. If you guys get the chance, definitely check it out! It will not disappoint.",1
7453,"The dishes are fresh and eclectic. From, beet salad with whipped goat cheese and pistachio to pork tongue and octopus. The music and atmosphere is very loud and often difficult to have conversations. The service was also good but the dishes were a little too  eclectic for my taste.",1
7454,Wowww must try duck. it gives different tasting at different portion in one piece. Excellent,1
7455,AMAZING! The bartender I had was phenomenal. The world needs more people like her. I am so sorry I didn't get your name but your beer and food recommendations were spot on. You need a raise for your awesomeness!,1
7456,"We received excellent service, but the pig's ear was not for me.  Perhaps we should have tried another dish.",1
7457,One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Whatever you try is gonna de fire. Don’t skip it.,1
7458,"I’m so obsessed with this place. We make it a point to visit every time we’re in Chicago! We always try something different, and we always love it!",1
7459,"Had porterhouse special (steak) - very good. I the mushrooms 3-ways was AMAZING.  Deep TRUFFLE flavor without taking over the mushroom taste.

I’m coming back tomorrow to try a pork forward meal & Saturday for Italian.",1
7460,Went with my son on the spur of the moment during a visit to Chicago. Dinner was great even though they were busy on a Saturday night. Staff was friendly and we sat by the kitchen and it was great to watch everything being prepared. Definitely recommend!,1
7461,"Lively atmosphere with a very unique menu!  We went on a double date night and had a great time with friends.  Be ready to drop some cash though if you want to have a full experience that includes drinks, desserts, several meal options to share.",1
7462,"We went for the Brussel sprouts, but they didn't have them. The cauliflower dish made up for it! Always so good.",1
7463,Wonderful food and awesome service. Love that the servings are meant to be shared.,1
7464,"The food was delicious. Service was prompt and friendly. A little noisier than I would like. But overall a good experience. Also the food is very rich, so the portions are smaller than what you would expect. But very tasty.",1
7465,The food here was incredible. Must have reservations.,1
7466,"A staple here in Chicago. Some of the best cocktails in town. All very creative and most important of all, BALANCED! Food was also amazing. I had the whipped chickpeas and focaccia. Wow the bread was incredible 🤯
We noticed a few people “in the biz” at the bar and that’s how you know you’re at a good spot! :)",1
7467,"I would say this place is yummy but a bit overrated. The fried pig ear was recommended by many ppl but it was pretry oily. Food has special taste, worth trying. But i probably wont come back again.",1
7468,"Average at best! This place is past its use by date clinging to James Beard recognition. a bar that serves food is the best description I can find and the star item would be the tuna tartare, purely for the presentation. No finesse here, sloppy, amateur service, poor presentation and my pet peeve??? chairs on tables while 50% capacity and servers blatantly on phones during service! so many other options.",0
7469,"Purple Pig is always our go to.  The food selections are not your ordinary- always creative and perfectly prepared.  We were there last night with a large party of 15.  Our server Antonelli was fabulous.  He rocked management of our drinks, apps and dinners!  Thank again PP for a wonderful experience,",1
7470,Bone marrow is delicious. Octopus is bouncy!,1
7471,"The food was phenomenal. You have to try their pork belly - it melts in your mouth. Service was great, the atmosphere was pleasant, and it was an enjoyable experience. I would highly recommend stopping by if you’re in Chicago!",1
7472,Ordered the Cheese plate and a great bottle of wine! We just walked in and were able to get a two top. Service was great.,1
7473,Our hotel was across the street from this place so we decided to stop by. The food and the service were top notch! The tzatziki that came with the chicken kebabs was the best we have ever had. Everyone was extremely polite and always there when we needed them. Highly recommend!,1
7474,"Very good food. Super tasty. Probably the best I had while in Chicago. Service was fast and food came out quickly. I took off two stars because our server wasn’t friendly or helpful. Didn’t offer us drinks and came short to give recommendations on the menu despite knowing it was our first time visiting the restaurant. Our dirty and empty plates sat on the table for a while before anyone picked them up. Also, the decoration, music and menu just don’t blend in seamlessly.",1
7475,"Sat at the bar since that was the only space available. Having had the experience, I would actually recommend it.
The food is delicately prepared. Every dish is like a painting.
Must try is the Broccoli, it will change you mind about this vegetable. It is covered with a delicious tangy sauce that makes a delightful taste with the charred broccoli.
I also had the pork ribs, it was fall of the bone and very tasty.
I wish I had more space to try more of their food.
The service was on point, bar staff were very attentive.",1
7476,"Excellent food, had multiple small plates and they were all well worth it.  My favorites were the house cured sardines atop a crostini with smashed avocado, pesto and dill and the pork pate.  Didn't try the wine but their wine lost was extensive. Worth a visit for sure.",1
7477,Made a reservation over a month ago for a time I wasn't happy with just to get in. When I arrived to Chicago I happen to be walking by and went there wher I met Jessica who was beyond pleasant. She was very accommodating and moved my reservation to a more desirable time. The food was spectacular and Mt waiter who was super busy was very attentive. The person who brought out the food was really nice and was also concerned about our experience so much so I had to get her name Grace. Now that we are past the service let's talk about the food. If you don't like pork you will love pork when you leave here although pork isn't the only thing they do. The food here is on another level if you come to Chicago and don't make this one of your stops shame on you. I highly recommend and will continue to make this my must go place each time.,1
7478,"Super slow service for me, I had to walk up and order a drink refill because I couldn't find my waiter.  Food was fantastic though with my surprise favorite being the broccoli. Portions were bigger than I had anticipated so best for sharing plates with larger grounds.",1
7479,"Is this the best food in Chicago? If not is really close!The Roasted Bone Marrow is really balanced with the salad side that they serve, making the dish simply amazing! The pork belly is just perfect! Tender, cook to perfection and with an orange reduction that makes the trick to put the dish as one of the best pork bellys I ever had!
If you are in Chicago you need to you to this restaurant!",1
7480,"I have been to The Purple Pig a couple of times in the past month and both times were truly outstanding. I had excellent service from both Josie and Troy and they were super knowledgeable of the menu as a whole. I definitely recommend the place to everyone as the food and flavor are of the highest quality. Favorite menu items so far have been the tuna tartare, grilled broccoli, and the duck.",1
7481,"The purple pig is, in a word...exquisite. the menu is amazing and full of flavors you would never have paired together. The food is absolutely amazing, i loved every dish. Their inventive style and layered flavors really took my breath away. Definitely recommend the broccoli and trying the beets, they are absolutely stellar. The octopus was well done and simple, and their pastas never miss. This restaurant really knows how to indulge the taste buds and my hat is off to the chef for his menu. Amazingly friendly staff and the chef greets each table, a nice and traditional Italian touch. I would come back every week and recommend very highly. You will not be disappointed with their menu...and if you are, you have no taste.",1
7482,Delicious food and friendly atmosphere! Great 👍🏻 drinks one of my favorite restaurants in chicago.,1
7483,"Outstanding restaurant, there were six of us sharing all dishes so we had the chance to try about ten options from the menu. We went there not knowing much about the place but we were all surprised with the taste and quality of the meals and service. Cannot recommend more, prices are reasonable as well.",1
7484,"this was the best restaurant ever. gnocchi and chicken souvlaki kebabs were amazing. if there were 6 stars, i would give this restaurant 10 stars. overall amazing experience, friendly waiter, delicious very high quality filling food, please come here. i recommend it!
11/10",1
7485,"Very good food but AC set so low as to ruin the experience. In too large a section, only one waitress working (taking orders, giving you your bill). Lots of support staff clearing the table, bringing dishes. But when we wanted to pay and get the hell out of the place because we were turning blue from the cold, apparently only the waitress could pick up our credit card to process payment. I had to take the bill and card to the cashier.",1
7486,"From the staff to the meal, everything was absolutely qmazing. The duck was cooked to perfection, I highly recommend it!",1
7487,"Great place to eat at. I reccomend it for the good atmosphere.

I do recommend the wait staff to have enthusiasm, and give positive energy. Their neutrality gave off a I don't want to be here kind of vibe. Especially, our waitress who gave off the non-verbal, no smiling, no ""did you need anything else?"", etc.",1
7488,"We enjoyed our food here for a dinner - we got the whipped feta, ravioli, and pork belly. Everything was very flavorful. We thought our server could’ve been more friendly, but the food made it worth it.",1
7489,What a great place to eat. The staff was attentive and friendly and the food was great. Great experience!,1
7490,"Love this spot! We got the Brussel Sprouts, octopus, bone marrow, and Turkey leg confit which were all really good. Great spot and the line wasn’t too bad. Think we waited like 20 minutes for a table. Great service and ambience at the place. Well def be back.",1
7491,"Went for lunch and our experience was amazing.  We ordered the Beets, Mushroom medly and then the pork jowl and last but not least the chicken thighs.  The mushrooms were average imo but the other 3 dishes were 5 stars.  The pork jowl with duck egg on top was one of my favorite dishes ever.  Will be back",1
7492,A friend recommended so we went and wow. So many unique flavors like the bone marrow and octopus. But the classic beef short rib was unreal. I might come back to Chicago just to get that. 😂,1
7493,Milk braised pork shoulder was phenomenal. Went there for lunch on a recommendation and it did not disappoint.,1
7494,"My wife and I enjoyed the Wagyu Ribs and the Pork blade steak. Portions were large enough and very delicious. The waiters were very friendly and helping on the spot, much appreciated. Definitely received Five star service.",1
7495,"Very good food, the only down side is that the wait time for table is pretty long. We wait for a little more then an hour for our table. But it not too bad since it is in down town. You could just come in put your name on their list and explore down town. They will message you when your table is ready.",1
7496,Love love love love love love love!! I love everything about this place. I will travel three hours one direction just to go here. The food was so good. Who doesn't love champagne by the glass? The mushroom three ways hopefully never leaves the menu. 💜💜💜,1
7497,"Great appetizers, even the veggie ones were surprisingly yummy. Dessert is good. I don’t eat pork but the person I was with likes their pork a lot. The pistachio creme brûlée is amazing.",1
7498,"One of the most amazing restaurant I ever had.
Everything was just perfect, the sauce go well with all the dishes.
Although it is Purple Pig, but apparently pork is not the only meal that worth to give a try. We got turkey, pig ear, octopus, and chicken. All of them were way beyond your expectation. The atmosphere, service, everything were amazing there !!!",1
7499,"OMG-good!
The Pig Ears were the best thing I've had in a long, long time.  Some of the best gnocchi too, super soft and pillow-like.
All served in a super fun, casual vibe. Keep it up!",1
7500,"Expensive but super creative in presentation, flavor profiles and variety. The concept is ""to share"" and portions are balanced to the amount of people eating. Cocktails are divine, try the Negroni Mezcal Sour. It is a dining experience with options for everyone. I tried vegan plates this time, and loved the mushrooms three ways!!! Highly recommend...",1
7501,"First time visiting Chicago. We had a great time at this restaurant. The lunch was delicious, the service was terrific, and the restaurant was beautiful. I would eat at this restaurant again whenever I visit Chicago. We were four and ordered Burrata Di Puglia and Fried Mozzarella as starters. Then we had Roasted Salmon, Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Pork Ribs, and Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder. For dessert, we had Sicilian Iris and Lemon Tart.",1
7502,"Absolutely incredible!!!

I had the shrimp and Avocado salad and my wife and I split a charcuterie board.

The food was perfect, staff friendly and attentive atmosphere was upbeat and modern.

Will be on our must come back list!!!",1
7503,"Last day of Chicago trip and had lunch at the Purple Pig.  We were told by the person at the front desk of our hotel that it was great and our experience proved her right...  We got the beets, the agnolotti, pork belly and coconut Panna Cotta and banana sorbet.  Every dish we were given was great!  Service was great too.  Highly, highly recommended.",1
7504,"Absolutely amazing!! Highly recommend. Seating is quick, food comes out quick. Delicious, authentic dining. 5 people shared all dishes. We got about 8 dishes total.",1
7505,"I would have eaten every single item on the menu if I had the time and a bigger stomach. Excellent wine selection but the food is what stands out here. I tried 5 dishes plus desert and everything was incredible. Sharing is caring here so pick stuff you all will enjoy. Wait staff is very knowledgeable and attentive. Even at very busy times. Support staff comes along and replaces dirty plates as soon as you are done. Service is second only to the food. Eat, Drink, and Enjoy!",1
7506,I had an incredible lunch here. Items come out as they become ready. The arancini are delightfully crispy. Bartenders are very knowledgeable. I recommend the hummus and fococcia to start the bread is incredibly light and fluffy. This place is gorgeous all around,1
7507,Wish I took pictures. Food was amazing. My husband and I truly enjoyed every bite of every dish we ordered. Hands down best food experience during our 6 days stay in Chicago.,1
7508,"This place is fantastic. The service was great and the food has a very high quality taste to it. I definitely recommend the Spanish Octopus, Broccoli (or Cauliflower), and Bread Pudding. 5/5 would recommend.",1
7509,"I think the restaurant is overrated. It was very busy, but the food did not live up to our expectations and the service was just meh. The pig ears didn't hit the right notes, I've had better bone marrow too, the scallops were overpriced at $30 for 2 small pieces and the other dishes were lacklustre too..they also ran out of their famous broccoli..Ive been there twice as I was feeling touristy, but won't be back.",1
7510,"Fun little spot that serves great charcuterie options and spreads. The wine and liquor selection is pretty solid as well.

Prices are on par with what you would expect to pay right off the Mag Mile.

A little difficult to find, I wish there was more signage.",1
7511,"*Used to be good place* to chill and enjoy the food in Chicago. My last visit turned out to be the last time I will go to this place. 1/2 of the pork shoulder that I ordered is almost rare. I told the server and she instantly responded that it is perfectly cooked. I then asked her if you would have it at the stage. She said no way.

Edit: Reduce from 2 to 1 star after the restaurant replied that pork shoulder is fine (see picture below yourself). No way I will go or recommend anyone to go there again. Eating raw pork is very dangerous.",0
7512,Food was out of this world and service was great. Serious creativity behind the dishes. Pretty good portion sizes too,1
7513,"Really enjoyed our experience here! We came in for a nice celebratory dinner and the service, food and ambience was wonderful! Love the creative displays of food, inventive dishes and variety. Would definitely recommend :)",1
7514,"I highly suggest this restaurant, it was an amazing experience. Everything from the service to the decoration and the vibe that this restaurant has, was phenomenal.
When we got to the place they took our name and phone number and later on they text me to let me know when the table was ready, it was ready 20 minutes after the time we register and they have told us initially that it will take like 40 minutes.

Any wait you have to do for this restaurant is worth it because the experience will be fabulous.

The server was always checking on me because I told him that
I am allergic to shellfish so they made sure with the chef that the food was good for me.

The pork meat plate that we order was on point, was crispy,  juicy and tasty. The presentation of the plate was simply astonishing as you can see in my pictures.

Later came the pasta that I order with truffle oil and some pork chops. It was so delicious.

Then we order dessert, it looked like regular cheesecake but there was nothing regular about it, the taste was phenomenal melting in my mouth, with lavender on top you could smell and taste the aroma all over.
This was a wonderful choice for a New Year’s Eve dinner, I hope I can go again.",1
7515,"The burrata was phenomenal.  Beautiful tomatoes, crazy fresh pesto.  Presentation was functional and overall we were truly wowed by the dish.  Refreshing and perfect for our lunch starter.

Also tried the fresh pasta which was lovely.  This restaurant is a solid spot and unpretentious.  In the touristy area but felt like a place I would go back to if a local.  Great service and I had a chilled Sangiovese that was perfect.  Also I’d recommend the espresso with gelato which gave us a perfect pick me up to close out the meal, we walked out of the restaurant feeling great.

Thanks team keep doing your thing :)",1
7516,"the food it's very creative and good taste.
i love Tuna tartare. the service was good but i think would be better if they add some a couple more staff. good location. it's in the middle of town. Michigan road.",1
7517,"For such a location the prices were not insanely high. There was a good selection of beers and a lot of different food. The food is very interesting with the ingredient choices however each dish was tasty (except the fried pig ears, they tasted very over cooked).
Nevertheless, this place deserves 5 stars. The staff was helpful, patient, and attentive. Also there is an option for outdoor seating.",1
7518,"This flavor experience may have been the best I've ever had. I enjoyed watching Chef Bannos and his team send out plate after plate - a feast for my eyes. Here's a tip: if you go to the host, you may be told the wait is over an hour...don't worry! All seats around the bar are first come, first serve, and a majority of them were open when we arrived at dinner rush on Monday night. Seat yourself and someone will be right there. We picked the few spots in front of the kitchen, where you can watch the magic happen. Everything was timed flawlessly, so that when we finished one dish, the next came right away. Our server was also EXCELLENT at suggesting wine pairings, just ask! This spot is known for delicious food AND fabulous wine. We started with the Grilled Broccoli, creamy and bright, I am confident these were the best greens I've ever had. Next, the Burrata Di Puglia: after figuring out how to cut into it, this was the most interesting dish I tasted, balancing sweet, salty, creamy, acid, loved it. The Ricotta Gnocchi came next, and it melted in my mouth - as did the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder. If I had to recommend anything on the menu, it would be this pork shoulder as our whole group couldn't get enough. We didn't have room for dessert, but we ended our night with the blood sausage: I don't see this on the menu anymore at the time I'm writing this but if it comes back I would absolutely recommend as a starter or an ender!",1
7519,Great service and some unique small bites for the table. The roasted broccoli was amazing! Unique cocktails were tasty too,1
7520,"Really good spot with great food and drinks. Loved the beets, the scallops, the whipped feta and the bone marrow. They have an extensive wine list and a commendable cocktail menu. It’s super busy, so hard to get the server’s attention but the service is always impeccable. Will definitely be back!",1
7521,Absolutely fantastic. The filet mignon didn’t last long enough to take a picture.,1
7522,Great food and drinks. It’s definitely a place where you want to go with a couple of friends to share a bunch of plates with. The pigs ears and bone marrow have long been favorites of mine.,1
7523,"Actually I don’t know why there are so many people highly recommended this restaurant. The service…UNPROFESSIONAL! The waiter braced his back against the wall while talking to us. The food…AWFUL! We ordered bone marrow  and pork shoulder, unfortunately, they were so oily and not tasty at all. Don’t waste your time and money to try this internet famous restaurant.",0
7524,"Nice place but gets too noisy. Food is good but pricey. This time I had a glass of wine and was $25 and for 1 inch of wine in it, honestly have never seen that a glass of wine was so  empty. the procciuto was ok but no great and the serrano ham the same. Overall good but not great at all.",1
7525,"food: 10/10 - their food is artistic as well as being one of the best western restaurants i’ve ever had in the western hemisphere; and yet the prices are marginally lower than other fancy restaurants
service: 10/10 - the waiter kept us entertained, food was brought fairly quickly even during peak hours, and had a deep sense of humour and knowledge of the menu
variety: 10/10 - they have everything you could ask for, from variety of drinks to unique foods
cleanness/deco: 10/10 - so clean, and the atmosphere is perfect

this is literally the first “perfect” restaurant i’ve reviewed",1
7526,"Pappardelle Chicken Bolognese, English Peas + Sage = FANTASTIC
Great service also",1
7527,"My experience with my friends was more of a hit or miss with this restaurant. Some of the dishes were amazing, pear goat cheese salad and gnocchi were excellent. Other dishes fell flat and weren’t worth remembering. The Darjeeling that advertises Indian tonic, sage and other spices was just an overpriced gin and tonic in disguise. Overrated",1
7528,"Where do I begin! Absolutely everything was so amazing. I suggest going with a group of people so that you can share the dishes and get a taste of a few things. We sat at the bar and were served by a gentleman by the name of Julian, who was an expert at what he does to say the least. He was absolutely wonderful and took extra care to ensure our dishes were served at the perfect time. A wonderful experience, counting down the days until I can return.",1
7529,"I go out to eat at good restaurants a lot, and have for many years.  Very rarely do I encounter dishes that make me say, “Wow!” after the first bite.  Tonight at the Purple Pig, almost all of the small plates my group ordered wowed me.  The Ravioletta, the Squid Ink Cittarra pasta with seafood and cherry tomatoes, the Cauliflower, the Pistachio Creme Brulee, the Ricotta and Chocolate Chip tart.  They all were bursting with unique combinations of flavors that were unexpected but absolutely delicious.

I took my college age kids to the Purple Pig because I remembered eating there 6-7 years ago, when it was in its previous location across the street from the new location. I recalled it more for its fun ambiance, inventive menu, and great wine list, than for the quality of the food, which was certainly very good but not phenomenal.  Tonight, it was phenomenal.  The service was also outstanding.  Even the wait times after we ordered were shorter than expected .  They were bringing the plates out at a rapid pace.",1
7530,"Despite being incredibly busy, the service was fast as any Ive ever had.  The food here is downright good, explosions of flavor and interesting dishes.

The half duck was truly exceptional, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The crispy pig ear wasnt great but given the other dishes, I think it's not worth knocking a star.

Id say this is a must try dining experience if youre visiting chicago.",1
7531,OMG!! Try it; you will not regret. Strong Drinks; Food Beyond Flavorful.,1
7532,You MUST get the beets with pistachio butter and whipped goat cheese!   We also loved the pork chop and whipped chickpeas with focaccia.  Those three were more than enough for the two of us to share.,1
7533,"Incredible food! We really enjoyed all 6 out of 6 plates that we ordered! Great choices of dishes with pork meat, but also some interesting vegetarian options! Do not skip desert: the blackout chocolate cake with passion fruit was amazing!",1
7534,"Really wonderful menu, very inspired dishes! The turin and the Lemon Tarte were particular standouts. Although the mushroom 3 ways was also wonderfully delicate and flavorful!

It is VERY busy though so be ready for a crowd!",1
7535,Food was delicious. I love the family style ordering format & appreciate the great customer service. Also bib gourmand rated! A must-try if you haven’t.,1
7536,"Loved this place! I generally love Mediterranean style cuisine, and this place not only did not disappoint, it surprised!
The venue and service were both excellent. Looks posh overall, but feels casual: my vibe (especially with a toddler in tow). Here’s and overview of what we had:
- carrots - very good. My husband liked them, though found them sweet (but he would)
- burrata - beautiful presentation, surprising combo of flavours
- octopus- excellent. I was expecting a Mexican style “salsa verde” but it was more like a chimichurri - herby, oily (in the best way), and bright. Potatoes and beans that came with this dish were cooked al dente/to perfection!
For desert: fior do late. Beautiful flavour to the custard. orange and vanilla is a great combo! And can’t go wrong with fresh berries.
All in all, loved this place and I would recommend it. I want to go back to try more items on the menu.
Bonus: my 3.5 year old ate/loved everything!
Sorry, no pics.",1
7537,"What an extravagant dining experience! Our friends made our reservation for a party of five. We visited on a Friday evening at the end of May. This place was busy, but we were very well taken care of. Our friend who made our reservations, also took charge of our dining plans. After drinks were decided, he suggested that we order multiple appetizers and entrées to share among all of us. When the food eventually arrived, it just kept coming and coming! LOL.

The first highlight of the evening for me, was the meat and cheese trays! They always feel fancy and you just can’t go wrong! They totally delivered! But I’m pretty sure that basically everyone else was the most excited about the tuna tartare appetizer. I have to say that the presentation was quite exquisite! Although the bone marrow felt particularly fancy as well! It was served with thick slices of bread that were quite toasted and crispy on the outside, but very fluffy and light on the inside. It tasted delicious with the capers and cilantro provided!

The main dishes were just as impressive. While I was initially drawn to the pork, I have to say that it was the duck that really won me over! It had a sweet and sticky skin. And it comes with buns so you can pull it off and make yourself a sandwich!

For dessert, most of my crew went for an affogatto. But that’s not my style. I tried their bread pudding with Tres leches ice cream. Man did it deliver! The ice cream was creamy and not overly sweet. But the bread pudding was just about the most moist I’ve ever had and was perfectly sweet and delicious! I wish I could have more right now!",1
7538,"Worth the wait! The staff made great recommendations on what dishes to consider. 4 dishes was more then enough for 2 people and gave a good amount of variety.

The pork belly and tenderloin was the big winner. The pork belly melted in your mouth and was accompanied by the perfect sweet citrus marinade.

Appreciated the large selection of wine by the glass and 1/2 bottle. Normally restaurants dont offer nearly as many.

Only complaint was the coffee. Appreciated that it was French press, however the flavor of the coffee was extremely earthy and hard to drink.",1
7539,"Unique dishes with unexpected ingredients that pare well. I like the liver pate with bacon jam. It tied the line of sweetness, and got it right. I loved the broccoli. It had a wonderful acid level and the broccoli wasn't overcooked. The anchovy added good salt. The pork tenderloin was tender, with flavorful gravy and potatoes. I enjoyed everything. Our waiter was super helpful by explaining how to order, and telling us his favorite dishes from the menu",1
7540,Excellent experience and fun food and wine selection. All the dishes were great. It’s a bit loud and a bit on the pricey side for a small plate place.,1
7541,"The menu had a lot of variety, so we had to try a few dishes including the Bone Marrow, Pork Tongue, Foie Gras, Morcilla, & Turkey Leg. All unique, all very flavorful. It was very busy and a little tight for seating, but it may have been because of the Holiday. In any case, the Purple Pig is a Must-Try.",1
7542,"It's moved into new digs on the other side of the water - more spacious with more seats for all. The food. Mm mm mmmm.

Get the paté. Just. Get it.

Ate it and enjoyed every rich mouthful, with toasted crispy bread and conserves.

The charcuterie plate with 5 items was hearty yet light. Served with six condiments and crispy crackers - well worth it.

The mushrooms three ways was super truffly which is great if you're a truffle fan ,(which I am) :).

And the octopus dish was delectable - tender and slightly charcoal, served with pesto potatoes and asparagus. I broke my promise to not eat octopus after watching My Octopus Teacher. I'm very, very sorry octopi of the world.",1
7543,Overall good grub and atmosphere. Gotta question the salt roasted beets though.   Usually my urine changes color for awhile after eating red beets. Didn’t happen this time.  Kinda odd.,1
7544,"Wow! Amazing place. We came today because of good reviews on yelp. We love to eat, so we like to search new places that we can go. Today was our first but for sure not the last time. The food was great! A huge range of wine. Extremely nice and friendly staff. We ordered (I believe) “summer beans” for an appetizer and lamb ribs and halibut for maine course. Couldn’t find place for a dessert (next time). Really nice place in heart of Chicago. Good (not to high) prices. Highly recommend!",1
7545,"The food here was amazing and the workers here were super friendly and attentive.

I had prime bar seating next to where all the food comes out so I got to see all the different dishes.

I ended up ordering
Foie Gras: a little bit harder than I’m used to, I like it more pate then in a terrine but still good
Pork Shoulder: the pork shoulder barely needed a knife as you could just run through it with a fork. The pork itself was a little bit under seasoned but worked well with the complementary flavors on the plate
Brown sugar cheesecake: not too sweet and very flavorful

4.5 stars",1
7546,"Agree with the recent comments that service is poor. Waiting times for service was nuts. Food also was not more inspiring than what you could find at any other similar restaurant at a much lower price point. Unsure if time has changed the quality of the restaurant, but there are plenty of better options in the area.

Extra star as the bone marrow was pretty great. If anything that dish is worth the stop.",0
7547,"Definitely a very busy restaurant, got there just when they open the door and there is already a line of 10 people outside.
Food did not disappointed us, all were delicious and well prepared. My favorite were the milk braised Pork shoulder and the whipped feta cheese.
It is a busy and noisy restaurant but it is also a fun place to enjoy your meal.",1
7548,"I enjoyed my dinner at The Purple Pig Restaurant, especially the wine and food pairings! Appetizer and entrée plates were delicious and seasoned just right. We will be back!",1
7549,"Unfortunately, I did not have a great experience at The Purple Pig restaurant and it's slightly painful.  I traveled all the way from South Carolina to have a girl's weekend with my Bestie and was very much looking forward to this James Beard Award winning restaurant.  I booked reservations a week out and could only find a 3:45pm on Friday which we made work. The ambiance is ok and our waitress was friendly enough. Unfortunately, the first bottle of wine that I ordered, they did not have. No big deal, I just ordered a different one. We ordered the beets, roasted bone marrow and house cured sardines. The food came out fairly quick and we were enjoying our beets when half way through we pulled out a 4"" black hair. So, we discreetly called the waitress over and showed her. She never said a word and just took the plate from our table. Ok. We expected someone to come over and say something but they never did. So out comes our sardines and bone marrow. The sardines were great but the bone marrow bone was one small piece and after two dips with the bread it was gone. We look over at the next table and they have TWO HUGE pieces of bone. Huh. So we wait and still no-one comes back to our table to say anything about the hair or to follow up on our dinner. Never came back. So, we ask for the check and also ask to speak to the Manager. We are not trying to make a big deal out things but as a Manager I would expect them to want to know what's going on. Surprisingly the Manager comes to our table and says ""Yes, I heard about the hair in your beets but not sure how it got there since everyone wears hair nets. I told the Chef"". So, she told the Chef and knew about it but never came to our table? Weird. And we also ask about the bone marrow, and she explains some tables get 1 and some tables get 2, and that's just the way it goes. Once again, weird, right?  In the end, she gave us a free glass of bubbles and took money off our bill. I'm just hoping it was an off night but man, as a James Beard Award winning restaurant, I expected a bit more. I won't be back and wouldn't recommend it but from the other reviews it sounds like it can be good.",1
7550,"The food is absolutely delicious and definitely recommend. We had the filet, short ribs, and ravioletti. You can’t go wrong. Would have been 5 stars but the filet had to be sent back to be cooked the way it was ordered, slow on refills for water, and our waitress was nice but not attentive. The food though….delish.",1
7551,Amazing food and service.  Dishes are meant to be shared and are very unique and interesting.  The octopus was the best I ever had.  I also tried a potato ice cream with fish eggs and chips and has to be the most interesting dish I have ever tried.  Every dish tasted amazing.,1
7552,"Food was great, ambiance nice, it's more spacious than last location, which I like because the noise level is less.  The stuffed squid and ham croquettes were delicious.   The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because the desert was under cooked and I liked the pasta dish but just a little too much sauce.  I'll definitely be back because the staff is very talented and there's more things on the menu I want to try.",1
7553,"Sat at the bar, very attentive and nice server. The food was unbelievable - the bill was expensive when wine, tax, and tip were included but the individual food items were fairly priced.

Highly recommended, expensive but worth it :)",1
7554,"This place was delicious! We ordered the tuna tartare, the ricotta gnocchi, and the pork tongue.
The tuna tartare was absolutely amazing. The hint of olive oil was delicious, the tuna tasted fresh, the orange fruit pieces were so sweet and juicy, not to mention the cool presentation of the dish.
As for the gnocchi, I thought it was delicious, and the pulled pork really was yummy, but also be aware that the gnocchi is filled with some kind of cheese and the pasta is very soft and not chewy. I loved it but some people may not like the un-chewiness and the cheesy (it's not cheddar, btw) filling.
Lastly the pork tongue is a must unless u r rly grossed out by the idea. It was seasoned and smoke perfectly, crispy and flavorful. Definitely recommend the purple pig.",1
7555,"The wait is long so get here as soon as you can, but there's so much variety of foods. Our waitress was very nice and informed us that while the food portions are generous it's strongly suggested that everyone get different plates and share; family style. I will definitely be back to try more. The wine selection was very nice as well.",1
7556,"Loved! Just don't expect typical american pork stuff. It's more sophisticated food.

The Ravioletto pasta was fantastic. Crispy pork ears was good.",1
7557,"Great food nice staff!

The staff did a good job with social distancing table spacing was good also.
Troy was a very nice server and was very fast did a good job pointing us in the right direction.
Just felt nice to finally be able to sit down and enjoy a great meal!",1
7558,"The Purple Pig elegantly serves up rich, satisfying plates at a reasonable price. The open air environment outdoors can get noisy but honestly you probably won't care because the food is so good. The service is solid, but don't expect a fine dining experience. The flavors at Purple Pig hit hard and delight. The half duck confit and pork belly are mesmerizingly savory. There are no reservations so make sure to put your place in line early.",1
7559,"Probably one of the best dinning experiences that I have in my entirely life!!
Broccoli with roasted garlic & anchovy vinaigrette, Pork belly + Tenderloin, ginger glaze, carrot + espresso, Milk braised Pork shoulder, Mashed potatoes+ Crispy lentils and Ricotta gnocchi + Neckbone gravy. Best Restaurant I have been so far in United States, EVERYTHING was delicious!!!",1
7560,"This place. My God. Perfect place to load up on meat heavy tapas. To start with we ordered the Pork Tongue at the chef's recommendation and it was perfect. Just ever so lightly chewy and tender at the same time. Plenty of char and laminated in a sweet fatty glaze. The tuna sauce was very much like a hollandaise with some bite to it.

For mains we went with the Squid Ink Chittara, Spanish Octopus, and Morcilla Sausage. The scallops in the Chittara were perfectly cooked and lightly charred. The pasta had plenty of ink flavor and was exactly al dente. The cherry tomatoes were lightly dressed in a vinaigrette and blistered. Full of sweetness and pop.

The Spanish Octopus came with delightful charred green beans and pan fried potatoes. The salsa it was dressed in was ridiculous. Hands down. It was some strange sour and funky blend with a splash of citrus sweetness and effervescent olive oil background. It blew everything I ate out of the water.

Finally the Morcilla Sausage. It was a tender and crunchy blood sausage with plenty of deep funky flavor. The outside has just enough resistance to pop on the bite to give way for the tenderness inside. The fried polenta is ever so slightly fried and is full of cream flavor. Loved it, the texture was really more like a panna cotta than any polenta I've ever had. Wrapping everything up was a spiced apple spread and an earthy aged balsamic.

Excellent time here, the staff was impeccable, constantly moving and in control. Seemed like a happy crowd and it translated into their performance. I recommend taking the seats at the chef's corner. It was a blast watching them ride the waves and mingle with FOH.",1
7561,"We just kept coming back here, night after night. The food is adventurous yet approachable, and there's something for everyone. You can have bone marrow or a gyro in the same meal (I did!) and none of them would be considered a compromise.

The gyro is completely untraditional yet somehow fits the flavor profile more perfectly than any other one I've had. This is what I taste when I dream of gyros.",1
7562,Everything was excellent. We sat at the chefs prep area and had a blast just watching them cook the food. Highly recommend it! Lamb ribs were delicious. The calamari was very tasty too! Can’t go wrong with anything here. Thanks guys!,1
7563,"Experience was absolutely 5 stars plus plus. Food was superb. Rosario (may have been Antonio) the manager was the definition of accommodating which is what hospitality is all about. Had the Foie Gras, the bone marrow and the pig ears to start. Pig cheeks orechete and ribeye ravioli for dinner. 3 people and only 250$ phenomenal value!",1
7564,Fantastic culinary experience. Everything tasted amazing. Very creative and well put together dishes. Our server was also very helpful and professional. Cost was $190 for 7 plates (pictured) with half a bottle of wine and a 20% tip.,1
7565,"This place absolutely lives up to the hype, and the new location is perfect to fit its growing demand. My brother and I came by for a mid-week dinner and ordered the pork shoulder and orecchiette. The pork shoulder was phenomenal, truly mouth watering with each bite. The pasta was tasty and had a great texture but the flavors were nothing memorable. Both of us ordered some beers on draft which were also delicious. Highly recommend as one the best spots directly off of the magnificent mile.",1
7566,"The duck was delicious as was the prosciutto dish, complements top the chef! Bartenders dont disappoint either and the Blue Bauou mixed drink was on point if you're thirsty for something on the sweeter side with a bit zing to it.",1
7567,"Really excellent. So many creative options on the menu, it took a while to settle on a couple. The presentation is as good as the flavor. The wine list is fairly extensive, including a lot of options available by the glass. A couple minor missteps in the service, but overall very helpful.",1
7568,Yummy but I want more than a singular ravioli.,1
7569,"Very tasty. All the meals we ordered were tasty. Portions are small, so it is pricey for what you get, but the quality is good",1
7570,"One of the best meals I've ever had. Nice restaurant, maybe a bit loud. Dishes are meant to be shared. The turkey leg (can feed 2 people) and the milk braised pork shoulder (you can eat it with a spoon!) are to die for. I wish I had more time in Chicago to go back again and try other dishes. I've been recommending it to all my friends visiting Chicago",1
7571,"Usually great food with good atmosphere and okay service (depends on the waiter). Lowered to 4 star after last visit.

First time:
I came with a friend for a quick lunch and I ‏ordered the Choripan Panini and the Charred Cauliflower and loved both of them.

Second time:
I came with my family and we ordered the cauliflower and the sweet potatoes polenta to share, and we all ordered a dish, but unfortunately they forgot mine. In addition they decrease the cauliflower dish size by a lot (not cool)). We ended up ordering two more dessert. Most of the the food was wonderful.
I uploaded two more menus (cheese and cured meat).

Third time:
This was after the place moved to a new location (to the building across the street) and it looked fancier. I was with two family members and we ordered the Whipped Feta, Ham Croquettes, Caulilini, Pork Spare Ribs and the Milk Braised Berckshire Shoulder. I also ordered the house beer and we got some sparkling wine on the house. For dessert we ordered the Sicilian Iris and the Brown Sugar Cheesecake. The spare ribs sauce was a bit weird taste wise, but besides that all of the food was amazing. The service was also very good.

Forth time:
Definitely the least favorite of all the times I been here. Ordered the Gundi, Ham Croquettes, Cauliflower and the Pink guava dessert.
The Croquettes were good, but all the other dishes (even the Cauliflower which is usually good) were disappointing.",1
7572,I've visited purple pig before and had a good time. Retuned this visit and The kids that they have hosting the door were not very welcoming. She told me she didn't have any space for me because of reservations that have been made but I could sit at the bar anyway. I was brought water and sat for 25 minutes without anyone even noticing us!! I got up and walked out and was told have a nice day!! Was very disappointed,0
7573,The new location is outstanding!  Food and service remain top notch.  Alan helped us select a beautiful 2005 Italian wine and we ordered pork liver and bacon pate as well as a beef belly special and both dishes paired well with the wine.  Our bottle ended up on the wall of fame which just blows us away!  We'll be back on the 4th of July for lunch.,1
7574,Great spot. Really enjoyed the lamb shank and tortellini specials when we visited.,1
7575,"Don’t get discouraged by the super long, endless waiting list. You’ll be happily surprised and delighted by the taste and the presentation of the food. It’s a bit salty (I can’t lie) but the mix of flavors and textures is amazing! If you’re feeling adventurous try the pig ears... amazing!",1
7576,I’ve eaten all over the world and I have to say that this is one of my favorite spots. The atmosphere is casual but nice at the same time. The food is the reason to go. You will not be disappointed. We were lucky to snag a seat at the bar even though it was busy. The staff was very well informed and helped us navigate our way through the menu and select a perfect wine to complement our food. It was so good we went again the next day before leaving Chicago. I would highly recommend this place. It’s among Chicago’s best.,1
7577,"Delicious! We had a fantastic experience at The Purple Pig! The food is creative and so tasty, the wine selection is very big, the vibe is great, and out waiter was so lovely and professional. The place is very popular so it can get crowded and there might be a wait, but it's worth it. One of the best places in the area.",1
7578,My second visit to this restaurant. And this is a 10/10. Everything is super original and tasteful. You have to get something with pork. Pork belly is so good. Even the ham nuggets are amazing. Service is on point. I would go every time I’m in Chicago,1
7579,"Came here during my visit to Chicago on the recommendation of several friends. Sadly, after my dinner, I'm extremely disappointed! My dinner started like any other, we were greeted and seated by a very friendly hostess. Unfortunately that is were it started to go downhill. They have a rather extensive wine list, so not having much experience of European wine we asked our server for recommendations. He recommended a few wines for my friend and I, and we asked for samples on a couple. He brought the samples to us, but sadly, it didn't taste good, so we decided to order something else instead. After that our food started coming, and the food itself tasted pretty good, but not once did our server came by to ask how we were doing. However, he did managed to make his way to all the tables around us, not once but at least twice. He even changed their plates! After we were done, we sat on our chairs waiting for our server to come by, but nope, not even an eye contact as he walk pass our table several times. It was the busboy that came and cleaned our table! Once our table was cleaned, not only did he not offer us a dessert menu, he simply came by and said ""let me give you the check."" that unfortunately was how our night ended. No thank you for visiting, no have a good nite, nothing!!

Maybe it's just me, but I think what makes a excellent restaurant is having both great food and good service. The food I got was good, but the service I got was by far the worst I had in Chicago!",0
7580,"Great food and feel. Loved the ambiance but it was incredibly loud! We went on Thursday night and had 1 he 10 minutes of a wait, so not bad. You can wait outside and order wine or a drink and wait. It is a very small space inside. They have outdoor seating as well. They recommend you share plates and order a lot of different ones. My favorite was the truffle biscuit dish and the kebobs. So good. The broccoli was VEEY HEAVY and had a cream base, which made it so dense. Tasty, but I could only eat 1-2 bites. This is a pricey place so come prepared. Very extensive drink menu! 50 pages! For the 5 of us, we ordered 9-10 plates. Our friend who frequents this place says she usually orders 8 plates for 3 people.",1
7581,Lots of different flavors but I found the whipped goat cheese a bit overwhelming (wish I had some bread to eat the excess cheese) because portions are big. Only 2 unisex bathrooms but it's clean and roomy. was very full but servers are constantly passing by and clearing tables to keep it roomy for new guests and dishes. Pig ears was super crispy and best eaten at the beginning (I personally like it a bit chewy) and salted unevenly but if you mix it with the unseasoned egg (which was done perfect... egg white fully cooked with gooey yolk) . The quail egg was cooked perfect with Caesar salad. fried devils egg was nice but accompanying salad was a bit bitter. Meatballs were yummy but the 3 was just enough because I am not a fan of cloves or anise (which I felt like I tasted it inside the meatball seasoning).,1
7582,"Food was delicious! Flavors well balanced and complementary. Ordered the half duck, the broccoli, and the bread pudding",1
7583,"Been in and out of the big bad and beautiful Chi over 30 years & never been here, despite it’s been here for over 10 years!

I have just added this is a go to place on my return visit to Chicago!",1

Service excellent fast and elegant!
Absolutely to recommend to everyone !",1
7586,"Small plates restaurant but the portions aren’t obnoxiously small. Everything we ordered was a winner. We gave the staff a few ideas about what we were looking for and they made killer recommendations. We had the pig ears, sausage orecchiette and chicken thigh kebabs. The cocktails are unique, the wine list is impressive. I followed a recommendation for a Greek white to pair with the meal - and wow what a winner. Dessert was the Rocky Road Bombe paired with a Bitter End cocktail. Nothing missed - everything we ordered hit the mark. The experience was great.",1
7587,"Lively and loud, friendly and fabulous! Very attentive service from everyone. The food was spectacular...every dish was memorable. Both Spanish octopus and milk braised pork shoulder were tender and delicious.",1
7588,"Excellent dining experience. Be prepared for a cozy atmosphere,  with attentive and knowledgeable service.  The food was an explosion of flavors,  all unique and delicious.  The wine and cocktail list is very long,  so you are certain to find a beverage you will love, and the menu offers excellent pairing suggestions.",1
7589,"Yes, it lived up to the hype. We were able to walk in and get two seats at a communal table on Tuesday afternoon. Our server was quite attentive and gave us excellent suggestions even though she was quite busy. She created a special meat and cheese board for us to start with. We followed that with the crispy pork ears, octopus and hot dog. Everything was amazing and came out relatively quickly. Highly recommend if you're in Chicago and can make it.",1

7591,"When people think of Chicago, deep dish pizza and hot dogs always come first in their top of mind, however this place is truly a gem. The food is original, tasteful and exquisite. The restaurant is beautiful and the service is personalized. The variety of wines is surprising. It’s definitely a must do in Chicago. Two things to keep in mind: 1) They don’t take reservations, it’s first come first serve. 2) The Pork Belly may change your life after tasting it. It’s that good.",1
7592,The wait was about 1.5 hour so we decided to hit the chef bar. We did not have to wait long before seats open up. The restaurant is very well managed for the amount of customers. Food was superb and we thoroughly enjoyed watching all the chef go at it.,1
7593,First stop in chicago after checking into our trip and was not disappointed! We have a bartender recommended mojito with yuzu and an old fashioned both tasted really good! We also had the chicken thigh kabobs with smashed potatoes and the arroncini with butternut squash! Thank you guys for the suggestions and great meal!,1

7604,"I felt like I was tricked into a pyramid scheme eating here, since I'm staying here and every single person recommended that we come here.

The hostess with the curly black hair and glasses was unpleasant.

Crispy ear pigs taste like just some fried oil.

The beets were okay, and the beef shoulder was tender.

Pork tongue was alright. The macaroni tasted like the cold foods section of whole foods.

The Terrine was interesting, not much to say nothing stood out.

Polenta was like a fried potato. My friend liked the fried chicken drumstick but I'd rather go to popeyes if I wanted fried chicken.

Very underwhelmed because the whole city told us to come here but it didn't meet any expectations.

The nicest part was the presentation, so if you want to avoid lining up for a mediocre meal, dont listen and research on Yelp.",0

Everything we ate was a hit. Highly recommend this place!",1

We got a lot of plates to share and some beers. We really especially enjoyed the crispy pig ears with egg and kale, the gnocchi (so good!), and sweet potato polenta. We also got some salami which was served with pita bread and some type of pickled veggie, pork shoulder w/ mashed potatoes and gravy (the meat was so soft and delicious), and the broccoli which was pretty sour. All in all a great place to share plates of food and try new delicious things!",1
7609,"Not good as expected. The service is fine and the pork belly is great while other dishes is neither no salt or is not very tasty, maybe this is why it is popular. Average cost is about 80 per person.",1

We ordered the bone marrow, braised shoulder, and the half duck.

Cannot remember the last time I ate at a restaurant and enjoyed every minute of my experience and every bite of my food.",1
7612,"Weekday dinner wait time just prior to 6 was half an hour for a table for 3. Service was impeccable, with the entire service team super friendly and accommodating. The pork shoulder was pretty tender. JLT was an off menu order which they still were able to serve me, which was the best item I had that night; the pork jowl just melts in your mouth. Items really vary in size.  The pork tongue was 3 small pieces, so I expected subsequent plates to be on the smaller side. The blade steak ended up being served last and is huge; it was just ok...better items on the menu. Roasted beets was tasty if you need a vegetable to clear your palate of all the meat. The pork liver/bacon pate was pretty strong and salty; strong I expected, but too much salt.",1
7613,"Loved the food, service and ambience. Went after the renovation. As always, expect a wait. Tried the beets, broccoli, bone marrow, duck and lamb. The meat was tender and delicious. Would go back again.",1
7614,"Incredible - Food, service, ambiance. The octopus is the best I've ever had and their wine pairings were perfect. Finished with pink guava dessert (both pictured). Highly recommend, we managed to get a table for lunch. At dinner time there was a 3 hour wait",1
7615,"They moved to next dor building. The new space is much larger, meaning less waiting time as the new place can acomosate larger number of customers.
The food is still awesome, they added some new items in the menus and they takeout some.
We ordered lamb chops and pork ham (which could dead 2 people at least)
The prices are in the higher side but food quality  and the fantastic service justify it.",1
7616,"Delicious but a bit overly salted (squid pesto dish).  Oysters on the shell were very small.  House hot sauce was sour, not spicy.  Service was excellent and friendly.  Atmosphere is for foodies, not for children.  Good for single occupancy, huge line for two+ parties.",1

7618,"Why I people bringing kids here? Not really a kid place - and certainly no storage space for a stroller.

Other than that, always a great experience! Drinks were booze-forward with fun names, the  salted beets were by far the best way we have eaten beets. The gnocchi was sweet and spicy and the sprouts were fried but not greasy.",1
7619,"Loved the asparagus risotto, the pasta dishes are so so good, the calamari is a MUST. It is a cold dish, not what you are thinking but it's the best thing we had all night. Waitress did a good job pairing with a good wine. This place did not disappoint. Not anywhere near the all time top ten but it was great.",1
7620,"EDIT: FROM 5 STARS TO 1 STAR.

I originally gave this place a five star review after I ate here, but when I was going through my receipts after my Chicago trip and comparing it to my credit card charges, I saw that they tried to double my tip and overcharge me. I left my original review below in case you still planned to eat here, but make sure to check your credit card statement afterward.

----

Had an amazing experience at The Purple Pig! It definitely isn't cheap by any means, but it is an affordable high-end restaurant if you're looking for a nice night out.

They are a little pushy and rushy simply because there's so much going on at once in the restaurant, but at least the food came out pretty quickly.

The Bone Marrow and Beet Salad and Pork Jowl were amazing foods that were both excitingly new and still delicious! These three dishes made the whole wait worth it The fried pig ear was alright, but a little too oily and nothing to balance it out. The tuna was a major disappointment because it was too salty and there was barely anything on the plate.

While there were some dishes that we didn't like, I'm still giving it a five star review for these innovative dishes that are hard to find anywhere else. It was about ~90 for a good filling meal for three people!",0
7621,"Highly imaginative dishes. French, Spanish, European fusions.

Crispy pig ear is just okay. IMO, deep fry loses the original texture of the pig ear.

The Spanish octopus has a great sauce. The beans, asparagus and potatoes taste better than the octopus.

The pork shoulder is the best of these three. Very tender meat with gravy mashed potatoes.

Will come back again to try the ducks.",1
7622,"No, this is not good food. I don't know if this place used to be delicious and just isn't anymore, or there is a collective delusion that the their below average dishes are worthy of their reputation. The orecchiette was thick and stogie, swimming in pork fat. The skate wing special came whole, and looked like something that would be served to a velocirapror. It was undercooked with a sauce so boring it had no discerable flavor. The pork tongue was served over a dollop of pasta salad? The combo was like eating a Slim Jim at a backyard BBQ. Our meal was all recommended by our waiter, who must have been pulling a prank. I will say the hosts, food runners and bussers were very polite and efficient. The rest of this experience was trash and I had to apologize to my lunch date.",0
7623,"The food is sooo good and absolutely out of the ordinary. Super friendly staff which is a must for me, as well. I will, definitely, come back!",1
7624,Unique and delicious with great service,1
7625,"Excellent culinary experience and great service at the bar! The pig ears are fantastic as is the beef tendon chicharrones, which are outstanding! Excellent wine list too you can find something for your palate either by the glass or bottle.",1
7626,"My experience seems to be different from majority of people here. The food here was good, but the overall experience was sub-par. After about an hour and a half of waiting, we got a text that our table was ready. When we went there, we were told that we would be seated in their ""Private Dining Area"". What that actually meant, was a small patio made usable in a makeshift manner, covered with tarp with plenty of condensation on it to make sitting there feel like a rainy day. We had to cover our drinks, but managed to get a good amount of water on our heads and shoulders. So much for ""Private Dining""! Eventually we were seated at a cramped table indoors, but only when we asked. Such misleading remarks coming from an otherwise good place, make me not want to go here again. I might be an outlier here, but consistency is key to a good restaurant.

There's a pic of the dripped on menu that I'm attaching. Food looked and tasted good though.",0
7627,"WHAT TO TRY?!

The deep fried pig ears, pork belly, cuttlefish, duck confit and the steak. I think the seafood options looked good too. Dessert wise, the chocolate, lime, matcha and banana bombé is a good choice. The peanut butter and marshmallow fluffy cake is another good choice to choose too!

Other than the deep fried pig ears, I didn't try anything I mentioned above, but from the looks at other tables, it seems like they looked good.

What I can tell you is what NOT to order. The turkey leg and the milk braised Berkshire shoulder was just overly dry. The turkey leg was also quite salty. It was salty from smoking the meat already but on top of that the sauce to make it more juicy just went over the top in terms of salt though. For the pork shoulder, the mashed potato tasted delicious but the meat itself was just overly dry.

The experience here is meant to tapas style meaning you share a couple dishes with your guests. Some of the meat dishes are bigger in portion so just gauge how much you want to eat.

LAST TIP?!

Be prepared to wait in line during prime hours for lunch and dinner!! You can leave your phone number and they can text you when a table opens up though! The best option to get seated right away is to either come after lunch hours or right before dinner (ex 4:30 pm). That way, you don't have to wait in line!!",1
7628,Fantastic restaurant with a creative menu. Large portions great for sharing. Delicious!,1
7629,"I love this place! It never disappoints! Food is amazing and portions are large. The half duck confit is so good! Bone marrow, foie gras are also my go-to items. The wait is long but if you can get around it, def do so.",1
7630,"The name says it all..go for the pork!👌 Wait staff is polite and well trained and food is on point. Maybe just the ""vegetables"" dishes were slightly small.
Didn't get the chance to have dessert..but they looked delicious!
They told me that it doesn't have the same appeal as few years ago..but I think it's making history in the food industry..well worthy!
Ps:I like the idea of wine suggestion on the wine menu..it helps to narrow down the extebsive wine list for the newbies😊🍾",1
7631,First time back since they moved to the new location. As always wonderful meal. Held back on that fifth star only because I felt the steak was a little underwhelming. The sauce and fixings were delicious but I expected more from the actual cut itself.,1
7632,"This place is busy! Make reservations if you can. Tapas style served as it is ready.

At a place called the Purple Pig you definitely need to try some pork products. The biscuits, sausage, and gravy with foie Gras was a highlight. The dessert - Sicilian Iris - was bland and unremarkable.

I'd rate the food a 4. Long lines for the bathroom. No atmosphere because it's so loud. The service was TERRIBLE though! Had to ask for water (like I never was given water by the time my dish came out). Seated for 9 minutes before my server came over. Long time for check as well. Also server didn't seem acquainted with menu - 'what do you recommend' server - 'everything' *dryly me internally *finger guns going thanks bud*.",1
7633,"Amazing experience, bone marrow is a must have!! If you have just one dish, this should be it, with the jerky a close second. The rest were awesome as well, with the exception of the beef shoulder which was just fine (tasted just like well cooked home prepared shoulder, nothing exceptional like the rest of the dishes).
Read that there's a long line during busy hours so we came at 1730 and had plenty of room, though when we left there was a line forming, so if like us you hate lines be sure to come in a bit earlier since they don't take reservations.",1
7634,"We decided to come here for brunch since we couldn’t fit dinner into our schedule, and it was awesome! Delicious drinks and and food all around.",1
7635,"At Purple Pig, spacing & ambiance is everything. The hustle and bustle in the bounded space was just right where it created a sense of coziness and intimacy. It encourages you to engage and to enjoy. And the food was complimentary to the experience, making it wholesome and that much more delightful. Top it off with a glass of wine or beer, and you are golden.

It sort of reminded me of a well-run and self-respecting family restaurant somewhere in Europe, who are proud of their craft in both their space and their recipes.

Some restaurants who are looking to create a cool and hip vibe accompanied by a menu that are equally unique come off as off-putting for trying too hard. Purple pig felt, genuine.

We were lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar, but the appropriate wait is well worth your time.",1
7636,Amazing place. The food was great! A huge range of wine. There was a slight wait to get in as they don't accept reservations. Would recommend this place definitely! We tried the grilled broccoli and the chicken thigh skewers both of which were pretty amazing!,1
7637,"Delicious. We had the JLT, braised shoulder, and chicken kebabs. The braised shoulder was my favorite. It was so tender and flavorful, but each dish was amazing and unique. The Panna Cotta for desert was good but not on the same level as the entrees. Three dishes was enough for 2 people.",1
7638,The pork secreto and turkey leg confit were delicious but a little salty.  It was busy but the food came out quickly.,1
7639,Very good drinks. It was very crowded when we first got there so we had dinner somewhere else but came back for drinks. The staff was friendly and we got a kick out of seeing them close down for the night. They were all partaking in soup and tortillas.  It looked good.,1
7640,"Love this place! Great location. Food is delicious with reasonable price. It is always crowded and you can not reserve the seat in advance, have to walk in and wait in the line. The only thing that should be improve is the slow service but over all, it is still one of my favorite places.",1
7641,"¡Its an explosion of flavor!
What an amazing place. I notice that everyone in the restaurant was happy and enjoying their dishes, and i mean everyone, there was not a single person that was not smiling. I have never seen this amount of happiness and pleasure with food. I felt in love with The Purple Pig.

It’s a bit pricey but that should not matter compared to the service, the kind staff, the incredible food and decoration of dishes and their ingredients.

I had the pork belly, which was my favorite and some vegetables with pineapple and wine. By the way, there is an amazing sommelier at Purple Pig.",1
7642,"My second time here and it was great again. Plates come out as ready and sharing them all is highly recommended. Ribs fell off the bone, cauliflower was delicious and cheese and meat board was amazing. Came in at lunch this time to beat the evening rush since they don't take reservations.",1
7643,"Great ambiance. Menu can be confusing if wait staff does not guide you. We ordered quite a few dishes. We had the corn fritter, fried pizza, and chicken kabobs. The kabobs seems slightly under cooked. The pizza was the best entree. We also got a desert that was a concoction of peanut butter, marshmallow, and wafers. It was delicious. I recommend it based on its uniqueness.",1
7644,"I've been to Purple Pig couple years ago and loved it. Went back this time to see if I still like it, but I felt in love with it again :) The braised pork shoulder is a must-try. The potato chips & caviar & potato ice cream was a bit too salty for me :(",1
7645,"As a solo traveler, walking into places is always a gamble, but luckily there was a spot left at the bar for me. The food was incredible. Probably one of the best restaurants I've been to, to date. The service was great too. Giving me recommendations on dishes to try. How much I should order for just one. The people next to me even gave me some of their dishes to try as they couldn't finish it. Everything I tried was delicious. Don't miss this restaurant if you're in Chicago!",1
7646,The Purple Pig has a name that at first didn't spark any interest for me.  My sister picked it out for us to eat dinner.  Once we arrived after parking a block away at the hotel we were greeted by an hour long wait.  It was worth every second of wait time.  The food was divine and reasonably priced.  The service was good.  This is a great place to eat when on Michigan Ave in Chicago.  Would definitely go back.  Advise to get there early or call ahead for reservations.,1
7647,Great food. Amazing fusion of different flavors. Great experience.  Only downside they don't take reservations.  You can sit by the bar and watch the kitchen which is entertaining or wait for a table.,1
7648,"Great food. Kitchen flowed our order out super smoothly. Service was excellent. Every dish impressed, favorites were the feta and the scallops. Plating was on pointe. Ingredients were well above par. $65 a person for a decent spread wasn't bad, especially including drinks. If I have to complain, no flutes for a nice champagne list is crazy and the wine list should have proper glassware. Also would have been nice to have the razor clam take a more center stage with the scallops. As it was the pickled corn had a more assertive role in that dish. But that's only if I had to nit pick something.",1
7649,"Food looks better than it tasted.  A good place to come if you just want pretty pictures for your instagram.  It was a worthwhile experience to sit in front of the kitchen and watch the chef works.

Everyone was recommending the salt roast beets so we ordered one. It just taste like beets and way too salty.

The bone marrow dish was huge and came with 6 pieces of bread.  It also have a big portion of parsley salad with a vinaigrette dressing that nicely balance out the fat.  My advice is to only order this to share between a big group.  It's too heavy to eat more than once piece of bread per person.  Once the bone marrow cool down, the fat just stuck to your mouth and taste gross.

We ended the night with a beef cheek pie with broccoli ice cream and beef tenderloin.  The ice cream has a light broccoli taste but not too overwhelming.  The beef tenderloin was over salted.  The beef cheek pie looks like a chicken pot pie and has way more dough than filling.  It taste mostly like eating pie crust.",1
7650,The place was extremely noise and the food was a little bit above average. So many people recommended me this place but I think it didn't deliver.,1
7651,OMG!! the food was unbelievable!! We were in Chicago for 3 days... the 1st time we went was friday nite and as they dont take reservations the wait was 2.30 3hours... we decided to try our luck nest day for lunch and we were lucky.. we decided to share all the foods we have ordered... each item was exceptional... everybody gotta try this place at least once...,1
7652,"We ordered cornbread, Bavette Steak & milk braised Berkshire Shoulder. All three meals were tasty. We will come back to try other meals (the ones that are recommended by our waiter have circles next to them (on the first picture)). I wouldn’t call this a small plate, the size of the entrees were regular.",1
7653,"It's loud, crowded, great food, and worth the long wait!  What's not to love.  7/29/19 update: still as loud and crowded as 2 years earlier but in a new location across the street.  We missed somewhat being seated at a group table with strangers as we had during our first visit but still enjoyed the new restaurant very much.  Audrey did an excellent job of taking care of our service for the evening.",1
7654,"I went to meet a friend for dinner and when I arrived at 5:30pm it wasn’t very crowded so we were seated easily but as soon as it was 6, it became very crowded and loud. They don’t take reservations so I suggest going early if possible.

We ordered several items to share. One was a lentil dish that sounded interesting because it included lychee and other ingredients that I’d never had with lentils, but I felt it was underwhelming in flavor. The combination of textures were good thorough.

We also ordered a pork dish that was amazing, it was so tender. And a fish dish that was also good. I can’t remember what they were called but they’re in the pictures I took. We tried to choose items from all over the menu.",1
7655,"Awesome food!!! A place that you cannot miss when  visiting Chicago. Highly recommend the octopus, pork belly. Pork's ears actually tasted a but weird but the rest was very amazing. Should come early to get a table as they don't take reservations",1
7656,"I'm not really sure why this place is considered Mediterranean but that's besides the point.

Food: Nothing here is a stand-out. There is too much in the menu that they lose focus on what to spotlight. The pork shoulder was something I could find at any American bar, the pork belly is better marinated at every KBBQ restaurant, and can someone please tell me what salmon tartare is doing on the menu here!? The focus is very confused.

Dessert: The only redeeming part of this meal if I'm being completely honest.

7657,"Audrey was our waitress, they don't hound or hover, she and the servers are attentive. The food is made to share with someone else. The food was absolutely amazing. We showed up around 5:30 to 6:00pm for 2 we had no wait. You may be seated at a long table with other people, but there are tables for 2. I do not write reviews usually but this was ABSOLUTELY Amazing. For what you get the price is reasonable.",1
7658,"We arrived at 630 pm on a weekday with only two people, the restaurant doesn't take reservations but we got a table right away.  I think it could be challenging to get a table if you were a larger group.  Most of the tables were communal which was a lot of fun being able to see what others are ordering but space was tight which could make some people uncomfortable. Ordered to vegetable dishes and 2 meat dishes and all were amazing quality and was filling for the two of us, would definitely reccomend this restaurant for smaller groups and adventurous eaters.",1
7659,"Purple Pig is worth the wait in line. An eclectic Mediterranean-inspired menu is sure to have something for everyone and I have yet to try anything that isn't great over >3 separate visits. For coffee lovers, they're serving Counterculture coffee and the Mythos/Linea Mini combination behind the bar is (low-key) pulling better espresso shots than most dedicated cafes nearby - and even if you don't love coffee, the caramel bite they serve with it is worth ordering one.",1
7660,"It was nearly impossible to make a choice as to what to eat here as everything looked amazing. My wife and I split three plates per the waiter's suggestion, and since it was a special night out, splurged for dessert as well. Apparently the menu rotates quite often, but the artichoke dish we had was out of this world and if you see anything on the menu with duck or duck eggs, just get it. The attached picture is of the duck plate.",1
7661,"The service could have been better ... our waitress seemed irritated.

We were brought the wrong dishes but we're allowed to keep them and our correct dishes were served ... score there and the reason for 4 stars.

I still left a sizeable tip because it seemed as if maybe she was getting left little to nothing. The crowd seemed influential but just because you seem rich don't mean you leave good tips.

Her attitude changed alittle when she picked up the sleeve and noticed what was left ... by then it was too late to correct the service but maybe she'll think next time about the upfront impression.

This black girl does tip ...",1
7662,"The price is much higher that the menu picture showed on Google. I ordered smoked pork tongue and bone marrow. The tongue is pretty good but it's a little too salty for me, I recommend eat it with bread. The bone marrow is much worse than I expected. It's too oily even I ate it with bread and herbs. The herbs served with bone marrow are good but I still can't finish the marrow.",1
7663,"Amazing! The food, the service, the drinks! Loved everything. It is not a huge place and consistently packed. The tables are pretty close together and they have some communal eating. But the food makes everything worth it!",1
7664,"Came here the other day on a whim and would definitely recommend. The lines were a bit long for us, but the food was worth the wait. Everything tasted so good and the cornbread is to die for. Sitting on the patio was a little chilly so make sure you have reservations for inside if you don’t like the cold. Also, there are only two unisex bathrooms for this bustling place so plan your sitting accordingly.",1
7665,"Delicious food, great service!!!",1
7666,It is a rather expensive place and you have to register and then wait for  at least 30 mins to be seated. The good thing is that they have all this automated and you get a text message once your table is ready. The meals are for sharing (do not expect large portions though) and have a nice conversation. Depending on how you see it you can think on whether the tables are set so you can meet new people or that they are too close to each other and cannot have a private conversation.,1
7667,"This was the best place we went in Chicago. Very reasonably priced for food that you would be more than happy to get at a fine dinning restaurant. You can’t make reservations, so if you want to go for lunch you either need to show up right when it opens, or you go and put your name on a wait list and then go shop for an hour or so and they will text you when your seat is ready. It is communal seating... so be prepared to make new friends.

I had the Spare Ribs and the Hotdog. Both were recommends. The pig eat salad was good but the dish felt a little dry, even with the fried egg yolk. I wish the pig ear had a little more fat attached to it.",1
7668,Great suggestions from our adorable server. First time and I was very impressed. Great house made duck prosciutto and cheeses. The chicken kebabs with fried potatoes and the ricotta gnocchi with rabbit ragu and pesto were divine.,1
7669,"All the dishes were delicious. See pictures for food details. Got here at 11:45am on a Saturday and was promptly seated.

Note: the place is not in the big gray building at 500 N Michigan, it's actually a few steps south of that entrance next to the Bank of America.",1
7670,"Fantastic, we loved it. Sat at the bar in the prep area. The cooks are very interactive and friendly. Chef is right there expediting. The food is amazing.
Try the pigs ear and Turkey leg confit.
We'll be back.",1
7671,"NEW NEW Breakfast at The Purple Pig
It is absolutely Outstanding

Opens at 8am
Creative menu
Ingredients impeccably fresh

Lavender coffee cake with orange glaze.
Smooth  robust coffee for me.

Photos of a more than satisfying breakfast with a bloody mary. A wonderful way to start Jeff's day!",1
7672,"This is a must stop for my husband and I when we are in the Chicago area. The menu is unique and the atmosphere is perfect for a casual dinner with friends or a date night. We love the small plates because we get to try so much of the menu without getting too full. Everything we have ordered has been fantastic, but my all time favorite is the crispy pig ear! I have to have it every time we eat at The Purple Pig. Can’t recommend this place enough.",1
7673,"The flavor is okay. But....I ordered totaling 130+ food for pick-up, it was not very well packaged at all. No utensils/napkins, and each dish mixed in their one single aluminum box. The salt went out to everywhere, and the oil gets outside through two layers of paper bags.",0
7674,The octopus and fried cheese were great. Downside is there's only two unisex restroom stalls for such a large place. Staff were friendly. If you don't want to wait try to see if you can get seats at the bar.,1
7675,The Purple Pig has a wide selection of food and beverages. Some of the best food that I have ever tasted. I recommend trying something off of the menu that the waiter recommends if it is your first time. This is a much needed experience if you are looking to expand on options while near Michigan Avenue.,1
7676,"One of my favorite places. Be prepared for a wait, but it's worth it! I highly recommend the neck bone gravy, and the pigs ears are just as good.

The pheasant and pigs feet are interesting, but you wouldn't recognize what they are if the server doesn't tell you. I was almost disappointed to not have received a hoof on my plate.",1
7677,"Everything I ordered was very good. I had eggplant caponata, a hotdog with fries, and an amazing dessert, a Sicilian Iris. Caponata was very flavorful, large serving. The hotdog was good....but the fries! They were the best fries I've ever had! I always order my fries ""extra crispy"", but I did not know these came with the hotdog, so amazing crispy appears to be their standard! And the dessert was lovely crispy on the outside, melty sweet filling with chocolate chips.",1
7678,"Great food, excellent quality and interesting compositions, perfectly seasoned. Always busy and full, quite loud.",1
7679,"This is a culinary experience that you do not want to miss, if you are looking for everyday ordinary, look elsewhere. Need to be a little adventours in the eating Dept, but it is worth every minute of dining here. Top notch staff, knowledgeable and very friendly!",1
7680,Great food and friendly service,1
7681,"Delicious food and nice environment! So sad I only got to go there on my lasy day in Chicago. I wish I had more time to go back again and try the rest of the menu as everything sounds delicious.
We had the octopus a la plancha, grilled broccoli, pork belly and turkey leg confit. I was a bit skeptical about the broccoli but I have to confess that it was my favorite and I would eat broccoli everyday if it tasted like that. Highly recommend it!

Can’t wait to go back to Chicago and try other things from the menu!",1
7682,"This restaurant was recommended by a friend and did not disappoint, in fact it had the best dishes I've tried in Chicago so far. The service was excellent and the staff did an awesome job of recommending appetizers as well as drink pairings for entree's. Looking forward to visiting again in the near future to sample other menu items. Highly recommend!",1
7683,"Nice, reasonably priced place for a meal. Given it's ratings there is usually a queue, but often there are seats available at the bar.
Food is OK, but not great, they have a very good selection of wine.",1
7684,"The most amazing pork meal of my life. The Blade Steak was melt in your mouth pork perfection. Also tried a portion of a friend's salmon that was delicious, although a bit on the small side. Had the duck prosciutto for an appetizer and was blown away. A pricey restaurant but totally worth the cost.",1
7685,"Just fantastic all around. I enjoyed the new location. We were greeted and shown to our table. Our wait staff was very attentive and the food came out quick. Everything we ordered was fantastic and I strongly STRONGLY recommend the milk-braised shoulder. Dessert was awesome and everything seemed appropriately priced.

Certainly one of the more impressive dining experiences and we'll be back for sure.",1
7686,"Very good service, both friendly and professional.  Our small party arrived without a reservation and was very fortunate indeed to be sat immediately.  We ordered a few cocktails & about 10 plates total.  I had done some anticipatory menu ""research"" and was very much looking forward to the food but ended up kinda disappointed.  The idea of the dishes was better than their reality.  Either salted beyond all reason, smothered until unrecognizable in broken sauce or cloyingly sweet, balance was nonexistent and the heavy-handed seasoning took a surprising center stage where the high quality ingredients and thoughtful preparations could have shone.

It was OK.  We wanted it to be better!  Maybe the kitchen was off.
I wouldn't not go again.",0
7687,"Loved the pork shoulder and service was quick. Pork ear was not good though, too much batter and too thinly sliced. Beats were great.",1
7688,"We ordered the bone marrow, turkey neck gravy, deviled egg and the potato ice cream with homemade chips and caviar. The bone marrow and turkey neck gravy were fantastic and we would order again. The deviled egg was good but small and the potato ice cream I didn't care for, especially for $19.",1
7689,"Amazing food. Loud setting, but this makes for a more open and less intimate date night place. Nothing super formal or fancy. Food was very good with every dish. Drinks were strong and unique. Food comes out as soon as it is ready to be served. So waiting doesn’t take long at all. Will be back again to try new dishes.",1
7690,Great place to share plates.,1
7691,The food is made with care and every plate is a great balance of amazing flavours. Real food with high quality ingredients just can't be beat!,1
7692,"I went here with five of my friends. It was small plates but so many options to choose from. We ordered a lot of food to share and not one dish disappointed us! The drinks, coffee and dessert were amazing too! Everything tasted so good and now it will be our go to spot for a night of fine dinning with a twist!",1
7693,"Very crowded, but the food is awesome. I got the communal seating which was nice since I was solo-dining and got to chat a little with my seat neighbors while oggling what they ordered.

I hear they don't take reservations, but will take down your name and number if you drop in to queue. I dropped on a Saturday at 6p and there was a line/wait. (Of course solo-dining meant I got a seat immediately.)

Portions are not large, but it's filling enough. If you aren't satisfied, a starter or side should be enough.",1
7694,So delicious! Highly recommend. Sharing plates w great flavors. We got 6 dishes and a meat/cheese board for 5 and we're so full. Cocktails were great. Service was excellent.,1
7695,"Not just another Chicago restaurant. What a Great dining experience! The understated decor and lively atmosphere really showcase the amazing innovative and beautifully presented dishes. There really is something for everyone. Whether you are in the mood to share appetizers and snacks paired with carefully crafted cocktails and tasty brews or celebrating a special occasion, The Purple Pig should be a top contender on your list. Let the rock star cooks and enthusiastic staff create an experience that will be truly memorable. Don’t skip the Bone marrow or Tuna tartare, and whatever you do, save room for dessert ☺️. Thank you 🙏🌸",1
7696,"Amazing food at a great price and serviced fast and beautifully. Service was one of the more pleasant places in Chicago too. Btw, we went by Girl and the Goat and it was a different story. PURPLE PIG, FTW.",1
7697,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! Every bite I took blew me away, the flavors of each dish was so unique and balanced. The staff is what really stood out though, we had multiple servers, managers, food runners and bussers assisting us happily. Even the security guy was super friendly and fun to talk to. The two servers I asked about wine were extremely knowledgeable, they listened to what I did and didn't know about wine, and I ended up trying something I've never heard of but I was completely in love with! Absolutely worth the hour and a half wait, which wasn't that big of a deal, we arrived without being hungry and we ordered a bottle of wine to sip on while we waited. Not just a restaurant, it's an experience. I will recommend to anyone traveling to Chicago☆☆☆☆☆",1
7698,"Crowded when we came. There was a 1.5 hr wait to get a table for 2. So we went to the bar which was also crowded.

Not a fan... bartender was unpleasant. Wished he was more helpful. He just wanted us to order even though it was our first time.

Ordered calamari appetizer which comes as a salad - did not taste good. It was bland with no flavor. I think I could have made it better.

Ordered the bone marrow... also not a fan. The bone marrow was good but not with the accompanying spices/herbs with it.",0
7699,"Great place! If you are a pork-lover, it’s the must visit place👍 They even have pork tail, pork tongue and pork ear menus!",1
7700,We sampled the beet salad and pork shoulder .. along with a Croatian red wine .. an excellent lunch for sure,1
7701,"Really tasty food overall, but the clear winner for us was the beet salad.

We arrived early. There was sufficient seating available, but it was still a very crowded space - difficult to move around inside. I wouldn't bring small kids here - lots of high top tables. We were seated outside in the alley...kind of odd, but work with what you have I guess! The food made up for that.

Ahi tuna was not the wasabi/teryiaki flavor that I expected, bit was still good.",1
7702,"I’m amazed on how the Crispy Pig Eras turn into a fantastic taste. The pig ears were cut in a long and it taste good and it was crunchy. It has fried veggies leaves and I don’t know what it is called and I like also its crunchiness. It’s like a chips. It has a top of egg with some pepper on it. This was really good.
You can also like their ½ duck. It was marinated well. The taste was surprisingly amazing. The meat was soft and it will be good if it paired with some rice. I’m sure you will definitely love it.
About their service it was half good. The service was slow you will wait before your order served. But the staff are nice and good. Their food was served a small portion so I just gave 4 star rating to this restaurant.",1
7703,"Great Date Night! Trust the recommendations.
It was a cold evening and the place we initially selected was closed. I was intrigued by the name of the place and thought, ""Let's give this place a shot."" I am so glad we did! We ordered and shared the Winter Salad, Pork Blade Steak, and Chocolate-Ricotta-Pistachio cake -- all were delightfully delicious. I went with the waiter's recommendations for wine, making the meal even better. This place exceeded all expectations. Happy Valentines day!",1
7704,"To start off you better call ahead, there can be a long wait just for 2 people. Now, the food and drinks were amazing! The atmosphere is lively.",1
7705,"This place came highly recommended, so we had to visit. When you go, keep in mind that they don’t take reservations. We went around 4:30 pm on a Tuesday and were seated right away. However, I was told that there can be up to a 2 hour wait time during peak hours.
They are a Mediterranean style restaurant and offer great sharing dishes - so you’re able to get a few dishes on the menu to try.
The food was delicious and beautifully plated! We got the Bobota Greek Corn read, the Pancetta sandwich and Sweet Potato Polenta.
Not only was the food delicious, the staff were very friendly and helpful with their suggestions.
We were seated on the Patio, which was covered at the time since it was a colder day. But they do have heaters.
My only concern was that we were seated at the back of the patio section, which I think was closest to the kitchen. We were very close to employees taking their break. I feel like a little more privacy for the employees and guest would be good.
Definitely worth checking out if you are in Chicago, it will not disappoint.",1
7706,"The wait time was unexpectedly short this time (about 20 min), which was nice. Food was as amazing as always, though slightly on the salty side. I took one star away mainly because the place always feels too crowded and too loud. You may find it difficult to hear what the person next to you (or in front of you) is saying sometimes...",1
7707,"Its tough to get in w/o a reservation, therefore, go to the Chef's bar if you don't have one. The food was excellent and the customer service from management to the cooks was amazing. We had a great overall eating experience here!",1
7708,Great food! We ordered several dishes to share. I was especially impressed with the salt roasted beets and gnocchi in pork gravy. Absolutely wonderful!,1
7709,"Came here for lunch! Sooo good, great atmosphere and service. It’s well reviewed for great reason!!!",1
7710,Delicious food and a wide variety of wines for paring. Good ambiance and service.,1
7711,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The food is excellent and it is a great place to sit and talk with others. They have an interesting array of menu choices. You can definitely find something you like here.,1
7712,The best pork belly ever in my life! Service is excellent even there are lots of customers dining at the same time. Definitely recommend to every friend who is visiting Chicago!,1
7713,"Really amazing food, moderately priced and a great wine and whiskey menu. Pro tip: go at off times as there are no reservations and the place is tiny.",1
7714,"We very excitedly picked the Purple Pig before traveling to Chicago,  not disappointed!!!  So many tastes 😋",1
7715,"Excellent Food And Service, We Will Definitely Visit Again On Our Next Trip To Chicago.p",1
7716,"Food was amazing!  The grilled broccoli was tasty (dressing was flavorful but not heavy). Squid ink Chittata was fine. The real standout was the veal breast.  Also got. Pistachio creme brulee for dessert (wished the yogurt Gelato was sweeter but otherwise a great way to end the meal) I would recommend.

I made a reservation about a month early for a Fri night dinner for 4, which I recommend as the place was packed!",1
7717,"It's weird but this place crosses my mind almost everyday when I walk back home from work thinking about dinner.
If I rewind the clocks about a month back, I find myself in this place enjoying a stimulating conversation with my colleagues and an even more stimulating cuisine! That was the first time I experienced a few absolutely marvelous dishes they served. We did try a bunch of things from their dinner menu and almost everything blew my mind. The bone marrow was great! The duck was oozing with flavours! However, the star of the evening was the octopus! I have never had a better tasting octopus in my life. The texture of the octopus was spot on and the salsa/pesto with the potatoes and beans were beautifully complementing it. Add their beautiful selection of wines to the experience and it's hard to resist the thought of this place. It's a gastronomic sorcery!",1
7718,The pork ribs and the duck are very delicious ✨❤️,1
7719,Skip the bone marrow but everything else was amazing! I wish every pork chop I've ever had was like that blade steak. Ditto for the turkey confit. The beet salad isn't prettiest presentation but absolutely delicious and worth ordering!,1
7720,Amazing food and taste. Great recommendation. Must reserve in advance.,1
7721,Excellent food and service! It's a bit cramped and extremely noisy but if you don't mind that and sharing a table the food and wine list are awesome.,1
7722,"Fantastic food, vibrant space, superb wine list.
The new (relocated) space is bigger offering more seats and more bar counter seats, the staff remain friendly and attentive and the food is what keeps me coming back!",1
7723,"Tasha, Meredith and the crew behind the bar are amazing! The drinks, especially the now named Purple Haze is BOMB! Can’t wait to be stranded in the Chi again, this is the first spot I’m going to. And the FOOD…. Don’t get me started!",1
7724,There’s only a few vegetarian options but they’re very good.,1
7725,As with other reviews.. a must visit in Chicago.. great food.. great atmosphere.. and a great and caring staff..!,1
7726,"Tried three dishes: octopus, pork shoulder and salmon.  The pork shoulder was what you'd expect, good.  Octopus was tender and tasty, it's accompanied potatoes and green beans spendid.  The star of our meal was the salmon and veggies.  This salmon was perfectly done and delicious!",1
7727,Been here more than five times and they never disappoint me! Come visit if you’re in Chicago!,1
7728,this place is easily one of the best. flavors exceed all expectations! next time we will come back and determined to try everything on the menu!,1
7729,"Fabulous wine list and tons of great food! The plates are meant to be shared. The liver and bacon pate was delicious! The restaurant was packed on one of the hottest days in the City, but the wait wasn't unbearable. Highly recommended!",1
7730,"Unique Vibe, Long Wait, Interesting Menu, Too much salt on several dishes we ordered. All 3 of my friends agreed. Still delicious though.",1
7731,A nice restaurant that has plenty of good food and wine. All the food tasted delicious. Def a must go when in Chicago.,1
7732,Excellent food. Too bad the servers don’t wear masks when Chicago is facing escalating Covid cases.,1
7733,Not a huge place but it has a nice ambiance and a good mix of unique dishes. The octopus was fantastic not rubbery at all like I've had at so many other restaurants. Smoked pork tounge was also very good.,1
7734,"They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait if you visit on busy hours... We went there twice while in Chicago, once at 4:00pm and another time at 1:00pm, and never had to wait. The service is great and the food amazing. The menu is designed to be shared, so you can try several plates! My favorites where the Roasted Half duck, Crispy Pig's Ears, Roasted Beets and the Stuffed Squid... I tried some other plates and they were all incredible..
The atmosphere inside can be a bit overwhelming and crowded, we sat on the terrace both times because of that...",1
7735,"Really popular place! We ended up going during prime time and had to wait about 2 hr 30 min to get a table and they do not reservations. I would suggest going and placing your name on the list and site see close by and they will text once your table is close to being ready. The food was good but nothing that really special. Tried various dishes and split them family style but again for the price did not think anything was just remarkable. The service was great and had a wide selection of wine, which I really enjoyed, but inevitably nothing really impressed me to want to come back.",1
7736,"Fantastic place. Great staff and delicious food. We visited the the reataurant during our Star Wars Celebration 2019 event. As advised by one of the venue staff members, and a fellow Star Wars fan, we ordered 4 plates for 3 people. We were told that the plates are for sharing and so we took a beetroot salad, beef steak slices, potatoes in tzatziki sauce and calmari. We finished it off with a bowl of creamy icecream!",1
7737,In honor of my German Mother had the bone marrow with crusty bread. It was amazing. The waiter recommended a wine that I would never have tried but was also fantastic. Also had the Scallion Garganelli which was an amazing pasta dish.,1
7738,First and last Chicago hotdog I’ll probably ever try! We got lucky trying such an amazing restaurant first. Very friendly and helpful waiter when it came to a wine selection.,1
7739,"This was one of our to do list in our recent trip to Chicago. I am super glad we could do it. The place has super cool vibes to it, the ambience was great. They have a great outdoor seating area too, Incase you come with a bigger group.
The food was pretty good, my only concern was it was super greasy which became lil overwhelming. Even though this place specializes in pork dishes, I got the octopus and it was yummmm.
We got the signature dessert which was delicious too.",1
7740,"I’ve hovered to get a seat at the bar for years, now that Jimmy Jr is in his new space it’s eas(ier) to get a chair or a table. New expanded menu, seasonal, seasoned, shareable does not disappoint.

Chicago Comes Back:  3/3/21 Open for lunch!  Social distant dining, lunch specials, accessible restrooms, great food & service.  Chef Jimmy in the House!",1
7741,"A consistent favorite. Meats, fish and cheese are exceptionally fresh. Ask for the Feta plate while still available on the menu. You have never experienced Feta as creamy and flavorful. Service in the waiting area is spotty, but one inside, especially if at the bar, service is exceptional.",1
7742,Amazing spot. The service was great and the food was even better. I ordered the lamb ribs - delicious! The portions are small and the prices are high but that's understandable - it's located in the heart of the touristy district.,1
7743,"Great food..very veryyy tasty. Most of their dishes seem to be like small shareable plates like tapas, and fusion that they seem to have created. The squid was very tasty. The waitress who served us, Rabiah, was very welcoming and gave us a great experience. The bus boys could be a bit more hospitable though.",1
7744,"Overall experience was average. In general if you wait a while for a restaurant I'd expect more on delivery. The staff were energetic and helpful, the wait is well documented, and the food is average. Issues that arose are when we came back given we were at the limit of what they quoted as wait time (45 minutes for us), they decided to seat us instead of actually messaging as promised. The food is somewhat hit or miss, with the pork being great, the steak was below average, and ham croquettes were also below. Presentation and atmosphere were as expected.",1
7745,"Amazing food and service. Was in town for 24 hours and it was so worth it!

We ordered the crispy pig ears, pork tongue, pork belly + tenderloin and the lamb ribs. Everything came out quick and so many different flavors and textures combined make this restaurant so good!!",1
7746,Phenomenal food! The Broccoli is one of my favorites! Tuna Tar tar was delicious.,1
7747,"We got there when it opened, sat at the bar and had the best restaurant experience yet!! Julian took exceptional care of us from beginning to end. He recommended the most amazing dishes for our adventurous palettes. We ordered beets and goat cheese, pig ears and kale, pork tongue, bagel topped with salmon and an arugula salad, with a bottle of Alfa Estate Sauvignon Blanc. And for dessert we ordered the honey cinnamon beignets paired with a spiced rum/orange liqueur coffees. I can’t stress enough how awesome Julian made our experience here. I will most certainly come back and would recommend to visitors of Chicago!!",1
7748,Best for quick lunch.,1
7749,"We went on a busy Sunday evening but chose to sit immediately at the bar.  We ordered cocktails as their menu was a bit too adventurous for our taste, at the time.  The drinks were great and I'll definitely return when I'm in the mood for something new and inventive.",1
7750,"Amazing restaurant. My wife and I like to avoid Michigan Avenue/tourists, but this place makes it worth it. Beautiful spot and great food!",1
7751,You’re either going to spend a lot of money or go home hungry. The portions are small and expensive but the service and taste is exceptional. Great presentation and blend of flavors. 5 stars because the food and service were great. Just a bit pricey.,1
7752,"Scallops was decent, pork shoulder blade was okay. Pretty disappointed since they moved to the new location.",1
7753,"With the exception of being crammed into this place like sardines...this place is dreamy. High energy, tasty nom nom await. Please order a Joan Collins. You can thank me later.",1
7754,"Part of our party arrived earlier than others and were seated. The staff started to ask how much longer before the other guests arrive impatiently. We all finally arrive and are eating the appetizer, when a lady comes to the table and advises too many of us are at the table and she's gonna check if we can have the next 2- person table adjacent to us OR we will have to get up and get BACK in line. I'll point out that we were the only people of our kind in the restaurant. Another man arrived to take our orders before the lady returned to advise we can have the table. The food was ok. I particularly enjoyed the pork shoulder and turkey leg. I won't be returning.",1
7755,"Definitely branch out and try something outside your comfort zone. This place was amazing and you wont be disappointed with anything! Pictured: milk braised pork shoulder, grilled octopus, and hummus.",1
7756,"The atmosphere is very good, friendly service. I particularly like the fried broccoli and fried pizza. Both are splendid and unforgettable taste. I would definitely recommended. I visited on Sunday 3:30pm. The restaurant is 75% to 80% full. From what I see only, it only allows walk-in",1
7757,"Generally food was a little salty but delicious and unique nevertheless. My husband and I were visiting Chicago and this place was recommended by many people, and we were glad we did!",1
7758,"Great food with prompt, friendly service. We had several amazing dishes, but I have to say the beets were the best thing I ate. One of the best bites of food in recent memory.",1
7759,Amazing food in an updated location. Love it. Can't wait to come back to Chicago and visit again.,1
7760,"Roasted Bone Marrow, Foie Gras & Pigtail Terrine and Roasted Carrots. All 10/10!",1
7761,Everything was highly delicious. We split about 8 different dishes and I loved everything (even octopus which was a first),1
7762,"Great food, a lot of drink options. A little pricey but well worth it. Very busy, get here early or make a reservation.",1
7763,"The food and service was great. One thing was a bit confusing to us though, the waiter told us everything was tapas style meant to be shared but based on the size and price of some of the dishes, they didn't seem meant to be shared. Seemed like regular size meals for one, like the Ricotta Gnocch.",1
7764,Service was excellent and food was absolutely amazing.  Smaller tapas style share plates.  Really great food quality!,1
7765,Were treated wonderfully as it was my daughter and SIL's wedding.  A complimentary glass of wine and a small hors'doerv were gifted to our wedding party of three.,1
7766,Great food and fantastic service! Tapas style concept.,1
7767,"Food was amazing. There is always a wait, but it's worth it and easy to walk around or grab a drink while you wait. Unique dishes and everything was delicious. Turkey leg confit, yum yum yum!",1
7768,Great Food! Awesome place to eat many smaller courses! Definitely cooks place to dine!,1
7769,Great place to try small dishes with friends. Service is quick and food is incredible.,1
7770,"This place is AWESOME!  Lots of tapas like dishes. Uncharacteristically, the beet/goat cheese dish my favorite. I highly recommend The Purple Pig.",1
7771,"Place is good. We were told the portions are served ""to be shared"". I found the portions small, but that was ok. Drinks were good too. When we order the food, I ordered the osso bucco and the waitress specificalle said that ""they were out of it"". Ok... no problem. We ended up ordering other things from the menu. All of them were tasty.

By the time we got to the dessert (lets say about 35 minutes after initial food order), the couple on the next table, that was sit less than 10 minutes ago, was served. Service is pretty fast considering how packed the place was. However, to my surprise, the lovely couple got a beautiful plate of.... Osso Bucco!!!!!! (Things that make you go... hmmmm). I, intentionally, asked the waitress what that plate was. She sturreted and had to admit that it was, in fact (as suspected) the Osso Bucco. She went kinda of rogue and blame it on the kitchen. ""That happens some times"", were her literal words.

I'd rather not to be lied about food. Other than that, its good place to have some food and drinks.",1
7772,The food is amazing! Go.  GO.  GO!!! I went two nights in a row. You'll thank me later.,1
7773,"Fantastic food, though pricey. The pork belly is to die for! Service isn't the best when they're busy.",1
7774,"Be warned this place gets packed!

It’s an awesome happy hour joint to go to after work with some coworkers - not the ones that you just invite to be polite though.

Great food selection. Great vibe. Reasonable prices for the area! Definitely check it out!",1
7775,THE BEST RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD! Be prepared to be blown away by the amazing flavor and care that goes into everything made here. Pork neckbone gravy. Try it.,1
7776,"Special place in a special city. Really enjoyed the food, pacing and service. The food is familiar but elevated. It was an amazing meal.",1
7777,"Great service and a better atmosphere. The Koji rubbed steak I had was amazing, and the cocktails are unique and delicious. This place is great!",1
7778,"Just delicious, nice and friendly service with good staff and good prices for the quality of the food. Huge wine list to select from. Recommend the Ribs with the Gnocchi. They say plates are for sharing but you definitely want one just for yourself :)",1
7779,Amazing lunchtime experience. Sitting at the Chef's counter give you a unique insight and special dining experience if you are new to the Purple Pig. Highly recommended must visit Chicago destination.,1
7780,Amazing food and drinks. The dessert was to die for.,1
7781,"Excellent restaurant! Very busy so make reservations if you can. Different menu than most with extremely fresh ingredients, family style food and seating. Well worth a visit. Try the bone marrow! A little more attention to food allergies would be nice but everything was caught prior to food hitting the table so we could correct. It was all delicious.",1
7782,I travel all over the country for work and try to stop at different non commercial chain restaurants. I also try to have something different and new. This is a great atmosphere place and the food and service was awesome. Spanish Octopus.,1
7783,The started patio seating which can be reserved with 20 dollar deposit. The food was ok... or maybe I just had too much of expectation. Everything is on the greasy and heavy side so if you are into that you would like the food. The only dish that impressed me was the octopus.,1
7784,"Great food, and even better service!  Thanks Ty!",1
7785,"I read somewhere that I should get the beets. Now you're reading it. Get the beets! Who knew beets could be so delicious? Loved the pork jowl and duck egg, too.",1
7786,Really enjoyed the food here. Interesting options that your should try. A little pricey though,1
7787,"This place! A must do Chicago experience! Atmosphere, Service, Food, Drinks.....a wonderful experience for mine and my Brides 10 year Anniversary.",1
7788,Food is fresh and tasty but a little bit too salty. Very recommended!,1
7789,"The food is very oily. Duck doesn’t work with the sour cream on the plate, chicken liver pâté doesn’t even taste like chicken liver. Overpriced",0
7790,I’m vegan and they were accommodating! Pricey and hard to get a seat but the food is amazing.,1
7791,Complex and detailed food. Ravioli brown butter and the chicken thigh kabobs were very impressive,1
7792,"The Purple Pig is a highly recommended place here in Chicago! If you are here in this city and looking for amazing place to eat, relax, and spend quality time. You must visit and give this place a try. Purple Pig is amazing! You will be surprise with their menu, it is so big, nice, and you can see how huge is the selection they have. They will offer you their best sellers and really affordable dishes. You will absolutely love their appetizers and their desserts. Their dishes here are truly delicious. They offer so many great deals like discounts, promos, and others. You can really save a lot here. They are so fair and reasonable in terms of pricing. You can order anything you want, try the food you want to try, and believe me that it will not break your pockets. They are cheaper than other restaurants around. This place is so easy to find, very near to other well-known place, and very accessible. You will absolutely love the whole place and the ambiance of it. Purple Pig is exceptional! Great foods. Good prices. Awesome staff. Amazing service. Good place. Thank you guys for awesome experience! You all did a really great job! More customers to come guys! Thank you for wonderful service! Kudos to all of you! Cheers!",1
7793,"Not my kind of place, the food was unique for the sake of being unique. I felt like I was shopping for dog treats.

When I got my food, I had watched my plate brought to two other tables before it arrived at my table and I had to ask to get a fresh one.

The food was fine, and they had good cheese but I would not come back due to wait time, price and service.",0
7794,"Great good, cool atmosphere and good table service. Great for sharing. We had clean plates every course without asking. Get the Sicilian Iris dessert!",1
7795,Absolutely loved that place and would go back. Excellent service and ambiance. Great drinks and appetizers.,1
7796,"The purple pig, this place is definitely one of the best to go to whenever you want a chill day, maybe with some friends or even just by yourself. but for my own personal experience, i recommend going in here with your friends just to have and feel the entire hype of the place! The place itself is already a neat view and very pleasing to the eyes, the staff would greet you once you go in with bright smiles and for a person like me, it definitely brightens the mood even more if I'm the one to talk! They would guide you to your chosen seat with you circles and proceed to give you the menu, and discussing it. There are very professional to their works yet also very friendly, very casual and simple. And their menu is highlighted with such delicious and neat foods and drinks, foods like fingerling potatoes, their fresh and well cooked meat and many more, also some drinks to go with! I definitely recommend this place a lot, especially the vibe of it. For a next time hang out, this is surely our pick again. Keep up the great work!",1
7797,"Had the most amazing turkey leg.  Was so moist came right off the bone.  Melted in my month.
Staff is very friendly.  You can tell the staff likes their job.  Cannot wait to go back and visit next time I am in town.",1
7798,This place was recommended by a good friend.. wow is all I can say. The food was amazing and the staff was friendly and very knowledgeable,1
7799,"Sometimes a challenge to get into this VERY popular little place just off of tony Michigan Ave,  but SOOOO worth it.  If you want to experience the full kitchen ballet masquerading as chaos, sit at the bar, near the food pass.  Watch these masters of culinary art put together complex dishes faster than you can say Jack Robinson.

Quail with Waffles
Fresh chilled tomato soup with frozen mozzarella ""snow""

Like you've never had.",1
7800,One of the best restaurants I have ever been too! Every dish is a work of art.,1
7801,"Servers wear masks, masks optional for customers. It was busy, but the servers were still attentive. The food was nice! I had never been there before and I was pleasantly surprised. Would recommend.",1
7802,Great restaurant ! Creative food combinations and flavors,1
7803,"Our dining experience here was wonderful. The food was so good, the wine was great, and the service was the best I’ve had in years. We wanted for nothing, and our server was super accommodating.

The tuna tartare and the broccoli were the stand-outs of the savory. The Sicilian Iris was our favorite of the desserts.

We will definitely be back!",1
7804,Wow what a great place! This place was recommended by a local and so glad we tried it out. We walked in without a reservation and despite it being busy were sat right away. Our server was great and there were so many good options on the menu but I will rave about the dessert. It was soooo good! We got the bread pudding and it was very delicious and fresh. Cant wait to visit Chicago so I can try more from here.,1
7805,Oh my goodness - the menu had such a diverse and tempting selection of menu items that we ordered WAY more than we could eat just so that we could try lots of dishes. Delicious selections included the most incredible brisket and mashed potatoes drizzled with pesto olive oil and accented with something sweet and crunchy (hazelnut?) - a fascinating and intoxicating flavor combination. We also had a delicious cheese board with a selection of meats that came with fig and apple jams to provide some sweet to balance the savory of the board. Add to that a board with three different types of mushrooms and a bowl of gnocchi with a veal ragu. Amazing!!,1
7806,The food and service was so amazing we came back a second time for our last meal before returning home on our vacation. I cannot recommend this place enough. Their wine list and cocktails were impeccable too! Definitely one of the best spots in Chicago!,1
7807,I’ve eaten all over the world and I have to say that this is one of my favorite spots. The atmosphere is casual but nice at the same time. The food is the reason to go. You will not be disappointed. We were lucky to snag a seat at the bar even though it was busy. The staff was very well informed and helped us navigate our way through the menu and select a perfect wine to complement our food. It was so good we went again the next day before leaving Chicago. I would highly recommend this place. It’s among Chicago’s best.,1
7808,"Decent service and the food was good, a little expensive but by no means unreasonable",1
7809,A+ food! Excellent wine selection and recommendation. Great cheese selection too!,1
7810,"As delicious as ever, but not sure it’s worth the wait. The ambiance in the new location is lacking - harshly lit, crowded and loud.",1
7811,"Nice place nice food. First time dining here, and the server corrie is so friendly and attentive",1
7812,"Some amazing dishes here! Loved the whipped feta, beets, cauliflower, gnocchi and more!",1
7813,"Went here for our 10 year anniversary from way out of state. 5 stars for the food. It was wonderful. Whatever you pick will be great. It's also the only place In Chi-town that knows how to make a cocktail. I only had one though, because that's how often our waitress checked on us. I had drank my cocktail before the meal arrived and never saw her again. We were done with our entrees and had to physically flag her down for dessert. I felt we were ignored for the other two couples on either side of us. 2 stars for service. For a 10 year anniversary dinner, it should have been amazing. But it just left a bitter taste in my mouth for the rest of the evening.",1
7814,"Very cool and trandy, wealthy vibes. Wait staff was amazing. Quick and always right there when you needed them. Rich, nice and hot entree of stuffed pasra with brown butter. So filling and warming to my belly. They only had fruity ice tea whic I don't like. I just like black ice tea.",1
7815,Still after so many years one of the boldest restaurants in Chicago in terms of fresh flavors and exciting combinations,1
7816,"Food Awesome! Selected beer was very nice but had a very long abbreviation Staff was really nice but didnt really know how to fit in a stroller between the tables so we had to wait for a while untill 4! tables left so we could sit in the corner. Next time: just put rhe stroller between 2 tables so there is one exit left for the other table. We had the colliflower, supringly good with the char and the sour of the gerkins. Octopus soooo tender! The homemade hotdog, awesome! With boiled crushed and fries potatoes.",1
7817,Very good food creatively flavored. We enjoyed our dinner and drinks,1
7818,"Dishes are delicious and creative, service is decent, plus good location at tourist site.",1
7819,"I have never had such amazing food in my life. I will always be searching for food like this for the rest of my life. Great staff, great service and the flipping fooooood!! Try everything, trust them. Come to Canada please!!!",1
7820,Amazing unique dishes!!! Experience was perfect.  We tried so many things for the first time and everything was flavorful and delicious.  Open kitchen and we sat right in front.  The kitchen staff works well together and runs very smooth.  Dishes are extremely fresh and come out fast.  Will be back!!!!!,1
7821,"Excellent excellent excellent.  Service was quick, thorough and friendly.  Burrata with the squash was vibrant and flavorful.  Farro salad would have been the star of the afternoon, at least until the mushroom and ricotta pasta showed up.  Wow!  Then the pork belly was so good I had to pause and reflect.  Finished up with some really nice gelato.  Surprisingly casual setting, so this is not a place you should feel intimidated by.  Order a lot of things and share so you can experience this menu.",1
7822,"We went for lunch a week or so ago. Damn fine ribs, fall off the bone! The drinks were just okay for the price, but I'd happily return.",1
7823,What a great place. Really good food. Must visit.,1
7824,Wow I had the Squash as a starter and the Pork belly which was cooked to absolute perfection. If you're alone the bar is a great way to meet people. When I'm back in Chicago I'll definitely be back to get the Octopus and scallops.,1
7825,"Always great. I like to order something different each time.  You might have to wait awhile to get a seat, but it's worth it.",1
7826,The food was really good. Place was very full when I went at 5pm trying to beat the dinner crowd. One thing to note is dishes are not served in a traditional manner. Plates are brought out as they are ready. Each item is intended to be shared. I would recommend this place to anyone that has just the smallest amout of adventure in your palate.,1
7827,Probably the best pork shoulder ive ever had.  The menu is creative and has some very interesting takes on some more common items. Big wine selection. And if you sit in the bar area you will feel as if part of the kitchen and enjoy the meal as well as the energy of this place.,1
7828,My favorite restaurant in the whole city. Incredible dishes from Chef Bannos keeps us coming back.,1
7829,"First off, hats off to the staff - they are exceptionally knowledgeable about their menu right down to the finest details.
I don’t think you can go wrong with anything off their menu, everything is so delicious.
Do not miss out on the Purple Pig!",1
7830,If you haven't eaten at the Purple Pig you don't know what your missing.  I really enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back.,1
7831,"One of the best meals we’ve ever had!  The food and service was top notch - our server was quick, attentive and gave us great recommendations. Everything was flavorful and uber delicious - we had the special, the branzini; hummus and focaccia; cauliflower; and roasted salmon. If we lived in Chicago, I can see us eating here at least once a week. This place is so good - we highly recommend and will return if we’re ever back in the Chicago area.",1
7832,This is a great restaurant. Well prepared food (they say the portions are for 2 but they are really for 3-4ppl). Fun atmosphere. Finished the meal with a vintage amaro that brought tears to my eyes,1
7833,"Came here for my birthday because I heard it was a good spot. The food was tasty, but our server was unfriendly and a little rude. Didn’t seem to want to answer questions about the food and hardly paid attention to our table— which is weird because he seemed friendly and talkative enough to the table next to us.

Honestly wish we had a different server (the other server working seemed really friendly), as unfortunately, this ruined the experience for us and we ended up going somewhere else for dessert because we wanted more positive energy. I don’t think I’ll be back.",0
7834,"The pork belly was amazing!
I think purple pig’s pork belly is world of best!",1
7835,"Pricey but worth it. Excellent creations. A bit too salty sometimes but that's just my taste, I want to come back to try other specialities.",1
7836,"Top notch food and drinks with an unbeatable atmosphere. If you get the chance, go to Purple Pig, it does not disappoint.",1
7837,"The food was fantastic. Lots of fat, salt, and vinegar. The place is small when they dont do any outside sitting. Would go back before I leave 😁",1
7838,"Great food, friendly service.  Wait can be very long due to small seating areas but good price good food.",1
7839,"I ordered the swordfish, ribeye, carrots, broccoli and beets with whipped goat cheese. The best thing we had was the beets with whipped goat cheese and I ended up sending the broccoli back. Was super excited but not that great. :/",0
7840,"Food is extremely salty. I tried the pig ears, the bone marrow, the chicken, ribs and everything was super salty. Not what I expected. Most overrated restaurant I've ever been.",0
7841,"I'm not impressed with this place duck pate, chitarra carbonara, and lamb chop. But the worse is that they never refill my glass while the table on my left and right refilled twice.",1
7842,Great sized portions for the price and the food was of course delicious!,1
7843,Food & drinks were amazing!,1
7844,"We had an overall good experience here for lunch. Order the chicken thighs. They were well cooked and flavored. Giving it 4 stars though because the plate was more of an appetizer for two, but priced as a meal for two. The waiter told us all dishes are sharable sizes. So that was a bit disappointing. But everything else was good.",1
7845,"Service Great, Food execllent. When around 5PM on a Monday. We where seated right away. Would go back again.",1
7846,Do yourself a favor and order a rack of pork ribs. Please. They are absolutely to die for.,1
7847,One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Get there early or feel the wrath of the line up.,1
7848,"Loved the menu,  loved the atmosphere! Food is fantastic!  Great easy location!",1
7849,"Nice atmosphere, great service and amazing food. Definitely would love to come for more.",1
7850,Very good food! I enjoyed the wide variety of dishes they have to offer.,1
7851,"Good, but some items may be too expensive, e.g., the tiny gnocchi in the pic was $20.

Re: Maybe we are looking at different pictures. The waiter told us it was a gnocchi. It was ok, but in my opinion is was too little for 20.",1
7852,Some dishes are a bit salty,1
7853,I was here with 5 others in my group and we ordered about 9 different dishes and I could not believe how excellent everything was. I kept waiting for some to even be average and it never came. I would suggest being a little adventurous and try the Foie Gras and Bone Marrow.,1
7854,Amazing food! We had an hour wait at 2 pm on Friday.  So glad we waited.,1
7855,One of the best spots to eat in Chicago. The food is amazing. New concepts in food. Tapas style ordering.,1
7856,Be prepared to wait to get ur table but totally worth it. The best I had there was burratta stuffed in cannoli and poached lobster.,1
7857,"We had a great time here during our most recent visit to Chicago. The place was busy, but our servers were still attentive. Food was interesting, and we'll executed, and beautifully presented.

For dinner, we had the bone marrow, the whipped feta, crispy pig ears, cauliflower, beet salad, milk braised pork shoulder and the pork chop. My biggest issue is that the portions were bigger than I expected. We ordered all that (and desserts) for two adults and a nine years old child. So yeah, we may have overdone it!

Thinking back about it, I'm upping my review from 4 stars to 5 stars as I can't fault them for me ordering too much!

Anyway, I recommend this place for ""porkly delights!""",1
7858,"An amazing experience we had a great connection with our server, and an even better ome with the food! The plate sharing, family style was perfectly sized for our portions, trying the ricotta gnocchi and half duck. Make sure to place the duck and all of its fixings on the brioche bun and eat like a slider! The wine pairings were great as well, and that is coming from a person who does not usually love red wine!",1
7859,Food was incredible. Service great.,1
7860,Didn't try the food because the waiter was so rude that I leave the restaurant. Maybe on my next visit to Chicago.,0
7861,Absolutely fantastic food! Have been here a couple of times and looking forward to coming back.,1
7862,"Terrible service, from bringing the wines to getting the check, through cleaning the table, checking on us so we could ask for something in the middle of our dinner and more.

The ambiance was also terrible. The music, the decor, the seating arrangement...

It's a cheap restaurant posing as an expensive one. They need to invest in more than just the chef; the dining experience is the whole combo, not just the food.",0
7863,"Stopped in on a whim and was not disappointed.
My family and I ordered the mushroom three-way, bacon wrapped shrimp, and half duck. Each dish was great, especially the duck (which was the largest dish of the bunch). I've had duck before and not been too enthusiastic about it, but this just melted in my mouth and put every other time I've had duck to shame.
The waitstaff was also quite attentive and knew the menu well (a bit overbearing at times with the constant topping off of our glasses, but it's certainly better than the alternative).
Will definitely return when I'm in the area again.",1
7864,Staff was very knowledgeable about the food and very personable. Food was fantastic! We had a great experience!,1
7865,"If you are in Chicago, this is a must try, everything was delicious! Stopped in for a light lunch with friends. We shared a few appetizers, the fried machengo cheese was amazing! We shared dessert as well, the Lemon Panna Cotta dessert was fantastic! We went back on another day just for the Panna Cotta dessert.",1
7866,Fantastic food. Best dishes I've had in a long time. Buzzing atmosphere. Absolutely worth a visit.,1
7867,"This place is amazing. I was hesitant at first because this place is BUSY and cramped. The seating is slightly uncomfortable. The food and service makes up for it. I tried multiple dishes including drinks, entrees and dessert and there wasn’t a thing I didn’t like. Our server was amazing, very informative and attentive. I would come back again and again.",1
7868,"Amazing experience, good food, and good service. Although I was a bit nervous to try some of the more exotic dishes, (like pig livers) it was all delicious! 5 stars!",1
7869,Yum yum yummm! The lamb was melt in the mouth. Five star food for sure!,1
7870,"Awesome food, fine wines, delicious cocktails and a great atmosphere. I'll be back!",1
7871,"Great place. They don't accept reservations so go early. Small plates to share, great flavors.im a highly allergic person and they were great managing my allergies and taking care. Super b!",1
7872,"Had the clam chowder for appetizer and the scallops for dinner... By far one of the best meals I've had in Chicago. Lots of salt, but I wasn't complaining. Highly recommend going here for your next dinner.",1
7873,Food was a bit too greasy for our taste. The bread basket was really good.,1
7874,"Very good food, excellent service, great recomendations from the person assisting us. Cozy place.",1
7875,Ridiculous. You MUST eat here. Large semi upscale bar/restaurant with great food choices and a giant wine selection. Reasonable pricing for downtown Chicago. Food was excellent.,1
7876,Food was great but the service and experience overall was truly bizarre.,1
7877,Only problem was with seating at our table. It was too crowded on a main pathway to the kitchen.,1
7878,"I like coming here when I visit Chicago. So far it's been a good experience. This restaurant menu es designed to share. They run of the best things fast so don't be too late. If you want two or more plates to come at the same time you have to let the server know, otherwise they will bring things little by little. The Panna Cotta is awesome.",1
7879,"I really enjoyed The Purple Pig. I wish I got photos of the food. The ribs fell off the bone, and the portions were plentiful. Great spot for good food, good drinks, and good company.",1
7880,It was better in the smaller space across the street. Not sure I will go back.,1
7881,Food was delicious and the cocktails were great ! Great options for both vegetarian and Pescetarian. Don't forget to try Salmon. Best dish on the menu !,1
7882,Our favorite restaurant to dine at when we visit Chicago! All the food was amazing along with the service.,1
7883,"Horrific service. Ordered a drink. Never came. Had to go to hostess stand to inquirem.manager came over. Offered dessert then charged us for it. Food came out. No plates. Worst meal in Chicago. Stay away. Pretend to care and they don't.  Waitress talked to bartender about her "", difficult"" table. If getting a drink and plates is difficult change careers!  Amd for the manager a $10 dessert is too much to make it right? Really?  So cheap. Stay away from this tourist trap",0
7884,"With so many great restaurants to try in Chicago I doubt I'l go back to the purple pig but if you're looking for good food in this neighborhood it's worth a shot.

Unique dishes that will delight some and confuse others. Smaller plates designed to share are a nice way to try it all but be prepared for a miss or two. To me the bone marrow was a miss but I'm happy to have tried something new. The pasta and vegetables were delicious.",1
7885,The food was amazing. The duck confit was so delicious. The star was the broccoli as weird as that sounds.,1
7886,"I came here a few months ago, first time in Chicago (I live in Atlanta), and had the absolute best time. Food was unspeakably delightful, service was timely and incredibly friendly (I sat at the bar, they make everyone feel like a beloved regular), wine list was on point for someone like me, who can be very picky about their vinos.

I have never left a review, being a 2 decade member of the fine dining industry and thinking yelp is kind of dumb, BUT. I had a dream last night of going here, and reordered every dish I had and woke up craving to come back, which has never happened before. If that isn’t a solid mark of how wonderful this place is, I don’t know what is. It’s so good my subconscious is begging me to return. GO HERE. You will not be disappointed. Trust. 10/10.",1
7887,"This is truly one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. The menu is great: they have huge selection of drinks and the food is very unique. We really couldn't choose what to order because everything sounded very tasty. The staff was very friendly and helpful too, so overall it was amazing experience.",1
7888,"Why doesn't this restaurant have a Michelin star yet?  The food, the service and the ambiance far excel the value inferred from the prices on the menu.  I loved everything about my experience, especially the attentive staff.  One of my top five favorite restaurants!",1
7889,"I enjoyed not only the meal, but also the company.  I was there on business and the restaurant had an orphans corner sitting around the edge of the bar.  Great group to get menu suggestions as well, I thoroughly enjoyed the panna cotta.",1
7890,"Very tasty small plates, and one that just didn't work for me. My favorite was the polenta with the beets a close second. My only real disappoint was the snooty waiter who didn't want me to slide over to sit under the heater. :P",1
7891,"Though I only stopped by for a quick bite and drinks it was a great experience Nai the hostess and the waiters were amazing and the atmosphere was wonderful. The chicken kabobs are a must and the French and Verano are lovely drinks, shout out to the bartenders for the drinks of malort and welcoming my date to Chicago 10/10 will be stopping by again!!!",1
7892,Great restaurant on Michigan Avenue near the Chicago River. Food was excellent but the place was too cold.,1
7893,"Great restaurant in an unlikely location.  Inventive dishes, delicious Mediterranean style, knowledgeable server who was just attentive enough",1
7894,"The Purple Pig is tucked inside a large building and you would easily miss it if you were walking in the city. It has a lot of different choices and is great for sharing as it's a little family style; although you can solo a dish if you want. With so many choices, like Squid Ink Pasta (Which I highly recommend) to Half a Duck, you'll be happy with your dish.",1
7895,"A must to dinne in. Tasty food, I have been many times asking different options and it always great.",1
7896,"Great service, excellent menu. Recommended the Half Duck and the pork belly",1
7897,So for some reason i wanted to try bone marrow never again im sure its good to someone but ill pass the next time lol. Great experience. Cozy. Service could be better its small not like you half to walk to far.,1
7898,"Amazing Mediterranean food located just off the river bank in Chicago. Beautiful food, awesome settings, quick service and everyone smiled. If you're a chi- town resident, you already know that you should get reservations first. Beautiful, festive, seasonal, warm and did I mention great service?",1
7899,Love the style of this place! Food and drinks was delicious and fast service,1
7900,"Food was fine, but very ‘large’ like a Cheesecake Factory for Mediterranean food. Also, food before drinks = negative 1 star. Service was very haphazard, busy restaurant, I get it, but…given the options available in Chicago and this place’s price point, I would not dine here again unless it’s on someone else’s dime.",1
7901,One of the best choices downtown.  Interesting menu. Cozy dining room and patio.,1
7902,"Very good food, flavors were balanced very well. Not a huge fan of the tapas concept but won't hold it against them. Portion sizes could have been a bit bigger.",1
7903,"The food is really good. High quality service. The environment is great, the large tables really connect people. Good place for sharing plates and taking no flavor for granted.",1
7904,"Went there yesterday. I found the place to be okay. The best dish was absolutely broccoli, which has the perfect amount of crunchiness and full of flavor and right amount of creaminess. The pork belly is a big let down because the sauce was too overpowering, and too sweet for my taste. I mostly just tasted orange. The bone marrow was good, but nothing special. I wasn't loving the capers to go with the bone marrow. The pig ears just tasted like fries. The goatmilk chessecake was very good, and not too heavy. Overall I'd give it 6.5 out of 10.",1
7905,"We went a while back but never got a chance to fully review this spot. It's a great gem (not so-hidden as everyone talks about it) and I gotta tell you I've never had pig's ears as delicious as the one they served here. Crispy, well-seasoned, on a bed of greens. I miss this dish so much and can't get it anywhere else.

Service was nice and polite and prompt, and the whole place was nice and jumping. Makes me long for the days that I could travel again...",1
7906,"This is my all time favorite restaurant. I live out of state, but every time I’m within 2 hours of Chicago, I simply have to come here. I’ve never had a bad dish, and it’s so refreshing to go to a restaurant that shows how delicious offal can be.",1
7907,Excellent food. I had the Orecchiette and the Vanilla-Lemon Panna Cotta.,1
7908,Knowledge and friendly waiter steered me towards the wine I wanted. The picky seven year old vegetarian was happy. The gnocchi could be the best I’ve ever had,1
7909,Everything you've heard is true.  A must place to eat in Chicago.  For the single travelers they have counter service.  Helpful staff gave good recommendations.  Looking forward to returning.,1
7910,"hands down the most disappointing restaurant experience i have ever had. it felt like we were eating in a rundown TGIFridays with a view of the dirty dish bin sitting at the table next to us. bad oak furniture, terrible ambience and the food was almost inedible. it’s been 3 months since we ate there and still can’t shake how bad it was.",0
7911,"Small plates done right, everything is delicious from appetizers to entries. Razor clams and bone marrow are the best.",1
7912,Fantastic!! Expensive....but Fantastic!!  Best halibut I have ever eaten.  Meat and cheeses along with mushrooms were the best.,1
7913,Great food & experience! dessert wasn’t as good as everyone hyped it up to be imo,1
7914,"If amazing is 5 stars, I think avarage should be 3. More details below.

This is place is hyped up and is in the center of downtown. That's why they attack trendy and business clients.

The place looks nice and the dish selection is diverse but the food is far from amazing.

While some of the items are interesting with new interpretations of classic dishes the food is just ok.

I have it 3 stars because the food is OK but overly priced for the product.",1
7915,"Excellent spot for a casual lunch.  The sad part, however, is that instead of watching the kitchen work, everyone at the counter was on their phones. Sad state of affairs.",1
7916,Great good and a wonderful selection of wines. Really enjoyed the Gratamacco,1
7917,"So yummy! Menu might seem a bit intimidating, but everything is just so freaking delicious. Polite staff, good prices, and great food for sharing with a date.",1
7918,"awesome experience overall, every single dish was a hit. highly recommend the whipped chickpea/feta spread and the mushroom agnolotti. the brown butter and aged balsamic sauce was one of the best bites I've had. cauliflower dish was also very unique with large pieces of cornichon in between, probably could've been a little smaller but the overall dish was excellent. Can't wait to be back",1
7919,Very disappointing :(  Everything was extremely salty and oily... Tried to give it a chance but every dish that came out was a disappointment,0
7920,"the food was delicious. our server mauro was awful. he was cold, flat and stale. when we had questions, he wasn’t willing to explain the dishes on the menu. made us feel like a burden to him. i even told him about my sister celebrating her birthday and if he could do anything special, and he stared at me a bit and then said “i can put a candle”.

the worst part is that when a new table arrived next to us, he was very talkative and kind.

a server makes your experience. i was in the service industry for about 7 years and i’ve never felt more unwelcome. we decided not to even get dessert because we felt uncomfortable.",0
7921,"Great service and AMAZING food!!!! Chad was our waiter and he was fantastic! Will definitely be returning every time we return to Chicago!

UPDATE: My boyfriend and I returned and The Purple Pig was amazing once again!!!! We sat at the bar and Mauro was our waiter/ bartender. He was absolutely wonderful and very knowledgeable, teaching us so much about so many different things! We got to taste a bunch of new whiskeys and wines and hear some interesting information about them. We ordered the artichokes for our vegetable and the milk braised pork shoulder and the tenderloin and pork belly to share. They were absolutely amazing!!! We love the intimate family style take on the sharing plates. The dishes are always unique and taste amazing. We also got takeout for dinner a few hours later. Will always recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for somewhere to eat in Chicago!",1
7922,"Got the fried pig ears, Spanish octopus, and half duck for two people. All were delicious and we were stuffed by the end of the meal.

There was more potato and green bean than octopus in the Spanish octopus dish, but the half duck was very large.

The location is terrific. It's at the south end of the Magnificent Mile, and a very short distance from the Wrigley Building and river walk.",1
7923,"Excelent service, reasonable price, amazing food. Go for the pork shoulder!!",1
7924,I absolutely recommend this place... the food is so exquisite. Fabulous!,1
7925,"We hadn't been back since before the pandemic. Truly the whole ""show up and get on a 2hr waiting list"" was a big issue for us. We loved how you can now book a reservation, although were disappointed to hear from our server that this might be only temporary. Please keep this, not all patrons can spend the day outside restaurant until it's time to eat. Other than that menu was perfect, everything we ordered was amazing. We will definitely come back regularly now!",1
7926,"While this place is known for its pork, I got a lot of mileage sticking to vegetables and fish.

The 3 Way Mushrooms and Tuna Tartare we're both delicious, and I was about to get the latter without nuts (allergy).

The presentation is impeccable, e.g., the Tartare was served in a wonton cylinder up it's side.

Overall, I highly recommend for a special occasion.",1
7927,Excellent place to eat and have fun with friends,1
7928,"Food was great, it was a tapas style plating where it is meant to be shared. The only complaint I had was it is billed as a higher class dining experience but you are seated in someones lap and very loud.",1
7929,"Food excellent, all the dishes we had were very tasty; tuna tartar, salted beets, 3 way mushrooms and the duck.  Mix drinks were good!",1
7930,"Some of the greatest food I've ever had the joy of eating. Sometimes a little salt heavy but otherwise just incredible marriage of textures and flavors. The Octopus is perfect, the pork liver pate drew tears.",1
7931,Great food. Sharing concept. Portions are small. Good experience in general.,1
7932,MUST GO. Came here and was blown away by every dish. Best broccoli I've ever had as well as the bone marrow. Located right in the middle of downtown so you're all set to walk off the food coma!!,1
7933,Fantastic flavors from a diverse menu. Service was on point. Highly recommend for anyone interested in a perfect meal.,1
7934,A little difficult to find non meat dishes but was able to sub meat sauce for red sauce for my gnocchi so I was happy. Great food and atmosphere.,1
7935,Went at lunch time and the service was excellent and the chefs really know what they are doing. Had bone marrow for the first time and it was fantastic.,1
7936,"The food was definitely 5 star. We tried a dish from every section of the menu.
It seemed like our table attendant had too many tables. The drinks took forever to get to us and their 2-mango signature drink of the night was for a pallet different than both my wife's and mine.
The automatic lights in the bathroom went out on my wife while she was in a stall. It was like a new talented chef had just opened his first restaurant and there were still kinks to work out.",1
7937,"My husband and I went on 9/12/21 to this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we had a really bad experience.

Our reservation was scheduled to 7:45 pm.  We arrived at 7:20 and were directed to our table and NOBODY attended to us!
No waiter/waitress came to meet us from 7:20pm to 7:55pm We got up and left! No one cared!",0
7938,The half duck is amazing and a must have. Also the fried pork ears was an amazing starter. Good service but long wait times and kind of a loud environment when it is busy. Still highly recommended,1
7939,My favorite restaurant in Chicago. The only sad thing is that the parking place on the corner is expensive...!,1
7940,One of my Chicago go-to places. Always delicious and always adding new and creative dishes and drinks to the menu. I rarely miss the chance to stop in when I am in Chicago. The bone marrow is a must have.,1
7941,Awesome place and space.  Great food and wine with terrific service.,1
7942,"The service is extraordinary. Their wine list is diverse, one can say ambitious, but without a doubt they know what they are doing. I simply participate and taste things for what they are.

The menu focuses on pig, hence Purple Pig. However, the brussel sprouts, the duck, the beets, the bone marrow, to give a few examples are delicious. More importantly all these dishes are means to be shared. This is the mediterranean charm.

As for the ambiance it's casual, yet make no mistake that this is a place working hard for a spot among the highly appraised restaurants in the city. It's no wonder their cocktails are well thought out.

Located in the magnificent mile of  downtown. Chicago. So if you are interested in stopping by you don't need many reasons. Even if it's just for their highly regarded dessert.",1
7943,The lamb was cooked to perfection in ways I'll never understand. It was magically tender and full of rich flavors. My wife enjoyed the squid ink pasta and livers without a morsel left behind.,1
7944,"I think the purple drink tasted better with light ice,  it was more of an alcoholic drink rather than sweet juice. It was 11 of us and we tried almost every dish on the menu. Loved everyone of them!",1
7945,"In town last week to celebrate a couple of birthdays and we happened upon ""The Pig"" while trying to decide what to do next.  What a find!  The drinks were what you'd expect but the Whipped Feta and the Hummus were THE BEST!!!  On top of that, the service was over the top.Herbert was full of great suggestions for drink & food and Nick came out from behind the bar with a ton of local knowledge in helping us decide where to go, what to see, etc.  Great service + great food = 5-Stars!",1
7946,Amazing food and excellent staff. It is a must if you are in Chicago.,1
7947,First time to this location so it's been a minute but nothing has changed except more room.  Foods on point and the staff nailed it.,1
7948,I can’t believe I have to shout so that my partner can hear me. The loudest restaurant I’ve ever been.,0
7949,I go to this restaurant every time I visit Chicago. It’s in a great area very close to the river (for good photo taking). The menu is diverse and oh so tasty!! There a lot of vegetarian options as well and even the simple things like the bread are really good.,1
7950,A must-visit spot for lunch or dinner while in Chicago.,1
7951,"The food here is so delicious!! The flavors are all great. Portion size is perfect for sharing. These are true sharing plates, unlike other places that give you 2 tiny items, to share with a party of 4!!
The only one the 4 of us didn't seem to care for and we're bummed about was the octopus. The sauce was too overpowering.
Even dessert was so good, even though we really didn't have room for it.
Cocktails we're good as well.
Highly recommend it! New space is bigger.",1
7952,"Good food, great service. Gets pretty crowded so get there early",1
7953,"The food is amazing.  Great service.  Really, really cool place",1
7954,"Unique dishes with unexpected ingredients that pare well. I like the liver pate with bacon jam. It tied the line of sweetness, and got it right. I loved the broccoli. It had a wonderful acid level and the broccoli wasn't overcooked. The anchovy added good salt. The pork tenderloin was tender, with flavorful gravy and potatoes. I enjoyed everything. Our waiter was super helpful by explaining how to order, and telling us his favorite dishes from the menu",1
7955,The place was really nice! They don't do anything special for birthdays.,1
7956,"1st visit (yikes)
Did not disappoint.  Everything was amazing.  Tuna tartare was 1 of my favorites.  Waitperson was so nice, helpful, gracious. Definitely would recommend .",1

7958,"Service is not well synchronized. All the food came at once instead of being staged. Our wine order was delivered when all the food had been eaten. Very disappointed about this experience. Very upset that staff did not care about us feeling let-down, telling us the place was closing at  9pm when there are still plenty of customers after 9:20 with dishes being delivered to the table as I’m typing this.",0
7959,We order several starters and entrees that we then shared around. The duck was amazing as well as almost everything we ate. If it was amazing it was still good.,1
7960,Fantastic food. Can't go wrong with anything,1
7961,Love the food and service was great. I just don't see any way to rate this place under 5.,1
7962,"Long time customer, starting with their first location. I have not had a dish here I have not liked. Everything is amazingly paired, with a satisfying presentation, and excellent service. I don't often find a place that charms me on all accounts.

I've tried most of their dishes, and will not forget when one time they had an order of barnacles flown in. I had a pleasant experience trying their dish, and the special sauce was spectacular! :)

We are catering from here for our wedding, and Amanda has been nothing but a delight to communicate with through our process.",1
7963,"Everything was so delicious.

Duck, bone marrow and pici",1
7964,"Phenomenal menu, unique dishes, all superbly cooked. Great new location (larger, more spacious, next to their old). Our server for lunch today, Brian, was Outstanding! Knowledgeable about the wine list, let my wife try a few before selecting, encouraged the right portions. It was fun to eat at the bar and watch tho open kitchen at work! Favorite Chicago Restaurant!",1
7965,Great location and atmosphere. I had a very friendly bartender. He recommended a great wine to go with my food. I had the burrata and the bone marrow. Both were delicious!! Cant wait to go back!,1
7966,"This place is hopping busy.  The tapas style sharing plates are a perfect portion. We tried several plates and every single one was better than the last.  I recommend the beets, the cauliflower, the cornbread and the fried olives.  Don't skip dessert.  So good. Service was excellent.  We never had dirty plates on our table.  They were very good about getting fresh cutlery and plates for all the courses which really enhances the flavors.  I had a few different cocktails and they were very tasty.",1
7967,"Good lord this place does comfort food right! Highly recommend! Turkey leg, pork (in any format), The broccoli!!",1
7968,"Absolutely amazing experience! Tried several of the dishes including the Bone Marrow, Pork Ears, Pork Belly, and Gnocchi.  Each dish was a marvel of taste and presentation.  The wine list is extensive and they are happy to assist with a recommendation.  Service was friendly and smooth guiding you through your culinary adventure.  Would definitely return to try more of the dishes we didn't make it to this time.",1
7969,"Great service and even better food! I definitely recommend coming here, even if just for a drink.",1
7970,Very good food!,1
7971,"One of my new  favorite place in town!!! The environment is great, service is wonderful and the food what kind I say it was a full experience.. the paté was and roasted bone marrow were just delicious and tried pig ears for the first time and they were super crunchy, finally the tuna tartare was so fresh.... Can not wait to bring our friends",1
7972,"Exceptional service, exceptional food. I had the beets, pork chop, and strawberry rhubarb tart - everything was so good. Had the spritz with my dinner, which paired nicely with the pork and an iced carajillo to finish the meal off. Literal chef's kiss.",1
7973,"Wow, I can’t begin to say how disappointed we were with this restaurant. We had made reservations a few weeks prior as that is the new thing right now and you have to pay $5 per person. That’s fine as yes, it goes towards your bill.
Once we got there the service was terrible, ordered drinks which we never got, but were still charged. Also, don’t tell the waiter you need a few minutes to look over the menu, you’ll have more then enough time to review it after that, ( 20 mins later), we ordered a few things which were just ‘ok’. We felt this restaurant was way more hype then it deserves. When leaving the restaurant the door didn’t shut behind and the door men had us come back and close it as he was talking with his co-worker (wouldn’t want to disturb your work). Just over all terrible experience, plan accordingly and look at other options.",0
7974,"It’s a good place with unique dishes. Most were hits, but some were just okay or weren’t what we expected from the menu descriptions. Overall, I’d recommend it to any meataterian looking for an adventure.",1
7975,"One of the best restaurants in my favourite city! Location is prime, food is incredible, and the shared tables with complete strangers makes for an entertaining environment.",1
7976,"Great food nice staff!

The staff did a good job with social distancing table spacing was good also.
Troy was a very nice server and was very fast did a good job pointing us in the right direction.
Just felt nice to finally be able to sit down and enjoy a great meal!",1
7977,"Great food and service is on point! We ordered the roasted bone marrow, pork ribs and pork shoulder. Absolutely tasty! Highly recommend this place!",1
7978,Food was absolutely amazing. Blew our minds with each dish.,1
7979,"We enjoyed an amazing dinner of shareable food, delicious drinks, and a fun atmosphere.  Be sure to save room for a dessert or four!",1
7980,"Amazing food and service, great ambiance and people, highly recommended",1
7981,"Worst dining experience in Chicago.

Our waitress was extremely rude for no reason, never came back to check on our table after taking the order,we had to stop her and ask for a water refill.

Waited 30 mins for the check, she said “ thanks “after rung the card, didn’t ask anything about the food or mentioned why she was never there when we needed her but a simple “thanks”.  WOW

I’ve never met any waiter/waitress being so rude and disrespectful. I’m here for food not your nasty attitude. Will never come back again and won’t recommend this place to anyone that wants to be treated property as a customer.",0
7982,"Amazing!!!! The ribs were the best we've ever had. Smokey, moist, fall-off-the-bone tender with an incredible blend of unusual and delicious flavors. Wow! The broccoli was also amazing! We sat at a long table that joined us with other diners, which in our case worked out great! Really enjoyed our table mate from Texas, in particular, who also generously shared his pheasant-- also amazing... cauliflower with pickles-- salty and flavorful....some kind of crusty potato-- which was so so....a meat platter with aged beef and prosciutto-- that was good but not remarkable...and a beet dish that also was a ""Wow!"" with flavor. Overall, a great and unique experience with generous portion sizes. (The ribs and broccoli really were enough for my husband and I to share.) Also have an extensive wine list, and likely other alcoholic drinks as well? Pages of choices! Our new friend tried two and declared the second perfect! Great experience--",1
7983,Great dinner spot in Chicago. Would recommend the pork shoulder.,1
7984,This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. It is a must stop if you’re around the Magnificent Mile.,1
7985,"It was OK. The crispy pig ears sound/look good but they are a bit too salty/dry. We order a daily special as well, and it was extremely average.",1
7986,"A Great taste of Italy.
Recommend Octopus and turkey leg. They are amazing!! The portion of turkey leg is really big",1
7987,"A must visit in Chicago right on the touristy Michigan Avenue. Never disappoints. Good food selection, love the turkey leg. Seating can be limited during busy hours, try to come early or take a late lunch/dinner. Definitely worth it.",1
7988,"How does a land locked state have the best tuna tartare I’ve ever had?

Incredible service and attention to detail.

Quality of food was fantastic for the price.

10/10 — will return.",1
7989,Many thanks to the chef and her team at this restaurant for the extraordinary job they did for the catering needs of my birthday party. The restaurant took on the job of hosting my event within very tight timelines. The food was so sumptuous and not costly. The place was so warm to have a party. I will surely celebrate here again!,1
7990,Just amazing.  We had virtually the entire menu tonight with our group.  Everything was a hit.  Highly recommend.,1
7991,"Probably the best food I’ve had in a while! It’s tapas style, so sharable plates. We ordered a lot of food! And honestly, EVERYTHING we ordered was delicious. I am still thinking about the food and wishing I could eat it all again! The drinks were good too. I love gin and tonics and they had a few special gin and tonic options. So refreshing. Next time I visit Chicago I will come here again for sure.",1
7992,"This is a restaurant that draws in a spectrum of clients. The menu and wine pairings are fun and delicious. Our server guided us through the very interesting choices and paired wines with each dish. We liked sharing several small plates, each of which offered a burst of flavor. The bar scene is very active and reservations are a must. It was our last night in Chicago and it was a great finish to our trip.",1
7993,"not as expensive as i had expected, and the dishes were creative. that being said, the only thing i tasted in the first two plates was grease. everything was extremely heavy. there was enough novelty to keep it interesting, but the pig ear for example put a cup of grease in my throat and was honestly difficult to keep down. pork shoulder was phenomenal though, and i do recomend this restaurant if you intentionally try to keep it *light*",1
7994,I normally never write a review! The staff was great but the food and ambience was just awful! I would’ve had a more enjoyable meal at the chick fil a across the way! I’m confused where all the 4 stars are coming from! Maybe just the staff because they were super friendly!,0
7995,Amazing food! Flavours were incredible!,1
7996,"I'm from North Carolina and we know pig! Loved this restaurant's atmosphere and the food was absolutely delicious. My advice is if you buy a t-shirt, go one size up. I've always been sad my shirt didn't fit. This was even pre-COVID!!",1
7997,"Food is really good. I had the milk braised pork shoulder. It was tender and flavorful. I like that they let you sample a wine first before you actually order a glass or bottle. The place is jam-packed but the crowd is fun, place is cozy and the staff are warm. Definitely a must-try restaurant in Downtown Chicago.",1
7998,"Walking into this busy restaurant tells me I'm in for a treat. I was correct. Sitting next to the food preparation area was amazing. Watching all of the great treats go out was an eye-popping experience. We had the beet salad, scallops and pork belly. We even tried the steak special which was more like a meatloaf, but nothing like your mother would make. We finished it up with lemon sorbet. It all was exquisite! The service was impeccable and immediate. They are well-versed in recommendations based on your likes. I only review The Best of the Best. Don't think about it, just go there and eat. My advice, take it, it'll be the best decision you've made in a long time. Share and like. Follow me, I'll keep you well fed.",1
7999,"It is more than 4.5 stars, nearly perfect! Service was excellent and didn't line up on a Sunday lunchtime",1
8000,"Turkey leg confit! The funny thing is that they actually present this with a huge knife! The meat just falls off the bone and is delicious! No knife needed, but it looks good!",1
8001,"It’s hard to believe that on a beautiful Saturday afternoon that we were able to walk right in and get seated immediately for a party of 5. The staff didn’t bat an eye. The Purple Pig also had a perfect combo of great food and great service. We had one person on a very low sodium diet (he had a major heart attack last year) and the team was great about finding dishes that worked) We all enjoyed the different and unusual combinations—octopus for one, and potato ice cream for another! I had a great pork bacon pate. With a table of five, we tried a lot of different dishes, and everyone was happy with the choices.",1
8002,"First time visitor, food was amazing. The mushrooms 3 ways were delicious and beautiful, as was the squid ink tagliatelle. Would recommend and will try to visit again.",1
8003,"First time eating here.
Definitely a diverse choice of entrees.
Very good bar service and knowledgeable employees.
Tasted the pork belly, New York strip, vegetable plate/ salad.
Excellent selection of wines and matched to meals if so desired.
Excellent service.
Definitely will go back.
Awesome bartenders!!!!!",1
8004,I wish I had eaten here 10 more times to experience the entire menu. I love this place. We were seated at the bar facing the kitchen and it was incredible to watch the staff work. The wine list is extensive and the staff is willing to make recommendations as needed. The pork shoulder is to die for - just falls apart and melts in the mouth. No reservations accepted - so plan to get there early to avoid a wait!,1
8005,Outstanding service and an awesome whiskey selection. Food was creative and tasty! I enjoyed the gnocchi and pork shoulder.,1
8006,We have always had incredible service and food here. Great atmosphere and a must visit when in Chi,1
8007,"Excellent all around. Immediately received attention. Staff was accommodating, courteous and professional. It was obvious that this place is run like a well oiled machine. We decided to sit at the bar and the service there was stellar. Staff took time to tell us about each dish we inquired about and were quite knowledgeable about all offerings. The menu contained so many delicious items that it was difficult to choose. We shared the octopus and the waygu beef. Both were off the chain good and beautifully presented. We ended with a chocolate cake and sorbet that was melt in the mouth yummy. Will definitely go back.",1
8008,"My first experience at The Purple Pig was excellent for multiple reasons.

The food was O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G and lived up to the hype. The presentation of the food was well executed and I admired the food runner explaining the appropriate ways to eat our multiple dishes. Everything came out beautifully timed and we never felt rushed through our dining experience. We had the Crispy Pig Ears, Grilled Broccoli, Roasted Bone Marrow, Greek Sausage, and Pork Shoulder.

My server Mauro was friendly, efficient and managed multiple tables like a pro! I'm a naturally observant person and I come from a restaurant server background. It's no easy task to manage multiple tables with various needs and he clearly had his tables under control.

The server assistants were amazing and exceptionally helpful in keeping the dining experience moving along. Regularly I observed them scanning the room removing dishes and refilling waters. In my opinion, they were certainly eager and enthusiastic to help in any way possible.

The wait was anticipated and to be expected. If you do your research online you can find out they do not accept reservations. We were told our wait would be an hour but it only turned out being forty-five minutes. Despite the wait for tables, the process was easy and well done.",1
8009,My wife and I went there for lunch on black Friday. We arrived a little early before they opened and got right in. Service was a little spotty at first as the waiter for our section arrived late. Since we we in no hurry this did not effect our lunch. We ordered a cheese plate and  wine. Loved the flavors and portion was just right. Big open space which  was busy and boisterous. Would definitely go back for any meal.,1
8010,"I sat at the bar, atmosphere was great. Bar tender was knowledgeable and approachable. I had the milk braised berkshire shoulder, the meat was tender and perfectly seasoned. The flavors were well paired, the sauce had a tart undertone which complemented the mashed potato. I would like to try other menu items as well.",1
8011,What a pleasant surprise. All the dishes we ordered were excellent. Their pork belly& tender loin and the asparagus were really good. Though for two people 3-4 dishes are recommended so the price is definitely not cheap.,1
8012,"Excellent excellent excellent service at this place.  I love that their waiting area has tables that allow you to order from the menu while you wait to be seated.  I actually don’t mind standing and eating while enjoying a glass of wine and tapas.  My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a cold winter night because it was conveniently located a block from our hotel and saw that it had good reviews.  It definitely lives up to its reputation.  We ordered the Brussels sprouts, deviled eggs, lentils, braised shoulder, and spare ribs.  That was more than enough for the both of us and we were happy with every single dish.  For dessert our waiter recommended the Sicilian Irish and although I was hesitant to order a dessert with a combo of cheese and chocolate I took him up on the recommendation and boy am I glad that I did.  I’ve been dreaming of it since!  The service is quick, the staff are very friendly, and the environment makes for a great wine and dine date night.  Highly recommend!",1
8013,"Great service, delicious food, excellent wines. Our family has celebrated many an occasion at the Purple Pig, and we’ve never been disappointed. We are adventurous in our eating and appreciate new selections as well as some of the classic dishes. The tables afford opportunities to meet people, and we often end up in friendly discussions with other groups. We usually plan on getting there just as they open, so we have choices as to where we want to sit, but if we come later we will will shop or go for a drink within a block or so, waiting for our text. Highly recommended!",1
8014,"Absolutely amazing.  The waiter was extremely helpful and very friendly.  The plates came out quickly and the flavors were incredible.  Honestly, I was a little scared at first with the fancy/foreign words so we stuck to the basics and ordered the pork shoulder, turkey leg, and chicken.  The dishes are meant to be shared and some are quite small so be prepared and order a variety of plates.  You can order more of something later if you really like it and let me tell you, you will like it! I will definitely be back!",1
8015,"Differentiated menu compared to other restaurants in Chicago, but too salty or too sweet haha
But taste is good",1
8016,The food was DULISH.  The service was amazing. From the busboys to the bar tender .,1
8017,The wait time was 2 hours. Not sure if the food was worth the wait and the hype around the place.,1
8018,"Their grilled octopus is the best octopus I’ve ever had. Great dish presentations and staff.
The beets and goat cheese appetizer was also really great.",1
8019,Stopped in during a rainy day in Chicago. Their menu was awesome and we picked a pasta and a seafood dish. They were both really really good and the wine paired nicely. Enjoyed the overall experience. Service was good and attentive.,1
8020,"BEAUTIFUL PLACE! I really had a great time and a full tummy in this restaurant, and thanks to the servers who attended to all of my orders. The food here is really amazing, and the service is very commendable. I could not ask for more from these guys because I was greatly satisfied with the food and service. Nicely done!",1
8021,"Enticing selection of creative small plates. Pork, but also seafood, some pasta, lamb ribs, duck, and a steak. Esp. liked the gazpacho salad and pork jowl. Very extensive and expensive wine. Cheapest 5oz glass was like $15. Top notch service but expect to wait, and wait to get in. More of a place to try out interesting flavors than eat a meal.",1
8022,Small plates but impeccably crafted flavors. The milk braised pork was like meat-flavored butter (in a good way). Interesting wine selection too,1
8023,"This place was incredible. Gnocchi sauce was complex, full of flavor and left you wanting more. I got my buddy to try the pork belly which was incredible. The fried brussel sprouts were great. Servers were knowledge and helpful. Great dining experience!!!",1
8024,Fabulous food!,1
8025,"Meaty and delicious. There is always a crowd here and for good reason. The food is incredible. Although the ingredients are sometimes non-traditional and sometimes seem over priced ($15 broccoli is pricey but it's absolutely one of the best dishes), I recommend asking the staff for suggestions. The chicken thigh kabobs and octopus are other personal favorites. Go if you can get in.",1
8026,The food here looks and taste wonderful. What I thought was another franchise corporate owned restaurant in Chicago turned out to be a gem. Cheers purple pig.,1
8027,"Elevated cuisine with very creative and good food. The wait is usually about an hour if they’re busy so try and get there early. The wine list is extensive and a little overwhelming but the staff was great with suggestions for what to drink with your meal. I’d recommend coming with a group, as the dishes are meant to be shared and often better to have a bite or two of each rather then the whole plate to yourself. There is a lot of pork and meat options, but also some vegetarian plates if your into that. I definitely hope to come back in the future.",1
8028,The food was great but the host was horrible. Before seating we were told we only had an hour to eat. It was early evening and the resteraunt wasn't even half full.,1
8029,Incredibly tender pork shoulder and delicious crème brûlée,1
8030,Best ever duck! Crispy outside and soft/tasty inside!,1
8031,Really unique menu. The pork belly and sea bass was delicious. Also had the braised stuffed Squid. Unique but delicious. Ask about happy hour specials. Large variety of spirits. Thank you Purple Pig for supporting our veterans.,1
8032,"The food was good. The service was not the best. I was super excited to come back to Purple Pig where my partner and I had our first ever date. To be honest, we felt discriminated against by our server. We ordered starters, entrees, wine and cocktails. While I was in the bathroom, my partner informed the server it was my birthday and the server said that he'd have to ""see [my] ID to prove it."" Why would we spend 200 dollars on a meal just to lie and get a free dessert? Maybe they just have to confirm that young, brown people are not pulling a fast one on them... My partner wanting to surprise me said it was fine and just ordered the dessert and asked if they could put a candle in it (they didn't).",0
8033,"Great service, excellent vibes. Food was tasty but not extraordinary.",1
8034,"This restaurant is truly the most wonderful place in all of Chicago and quite possibly the world! There is almost always a two hour or longer wait to get in and they do not take reservations but my God, the food here is worth waiting a lifetime to eat. Prices are extremely reasonable and service is always excellent. The drinks here are just as delicious as the food but make sure you bring friends because honestly, you will want to try EVERYTHING on the menu at least once. I have never been to a better restaurant in my life and I have traveled the world searching for one. If you go your whole life without ever eating here, you may as well have never been born.",1
8035,Excellent food.  Better than expected.,1
8036,"Elevated cuisine with very creative and good food. The wait is usually about an hour if they’re busy so try and get there early. The wine list is extensive and a little overwhelming but the staff was great with suggestions for what to drink with your meal.

8037,"Amazing. Went with friend. Thought we were going to wait for hours for the seat. But was able to sit down once we went in. Timing was fantastic. And we tried the bone marrow and prosciutto with different cheese. Ordered the lamb chops, which were the best lamb ever. With only $22? You can never get this quality anywhere else. Just fantastic. I’m in love with this place.
I would love to try the Gyro place that open by the same chef next time in Chicago.",1
8038,"Delicious food! Extensive wine list, great service. We did get seated at a high top with another couple, which was unexpected, but that is the “vibe” here so we didn’t care much.

Tad bit pricey (especially once the wine starts flowing) but I would say very reasonable compared to restaurants in this area.

If you are a cornbread fan, you HAVE to get the cornbread here.. it was so good I considered licking the plate!!",1
8039,"What a robust environment to dine in, foods are delicious and service was fast. We ordered 1 cheese and 2 cured meats to start off our lunch, and then got 4 other plates to share, I liked the stuff squid and braised pork shoulder the best, everyone has bone marrow on their table so we got it too but found it lack of flavor, smoked pork tongue took forever to come out but it’s was nice one. We got 1 drink each and overall it was $150 for the two of us.",1
8040,"Great food, great service! We ordered the pig ears that everyone talks about but were sorely disappointed. But the waitress said she would swap out the dish because she wanted us to love everything. Very much appreciated that.",1
8041,"The food was great. Good wine selection. The staff prompt and helpful. It was crowded and noisy-- hard place to have a conversation at peak hours. But, busy is what happens when the food is so good. (I would recommend a reservation, otherwise it's a long wait!)",1
8042,"Now I understand why this place it is so crowded. The food is delicious! Mediterannian food is my soul food. We tried several plates and every single one was better than the last.  I recommend the tuna salad, asparagus salad. The milk braised meat and chicken kebab were excellent. Don't skip dessert.  So good. Service was excellent.  We never had dirty plates on our table.  They were very good about getting fresh cutlery and plates for all the courses which really enhances the flavors.  I had sangria and it was very tasty.",1
8043,"Amazing! We got the two veg dishes on the menu and we weren't completely excited, but these flavourful meals blew our minds! (One was topped with popcorn?!) We were too full for dessert but would have tried anything on the list after those great entrees. I'd recommend to anyone! Side note: I'm gluten free and they were ready to accommodate!",1
8044,"Hog heaven! Sit in front of the kitchen, if you can, great to watch the action. Found this tasty Italian beer!",1
8045,"First time at The Purple Pig and I will definitely be back. The food is amazing and there are many choices. I would recommend the cheese board. We had lamb kabobs and a beet and whipped goat cheese plate. Just amazing, Their servings are meant to be shared. The pricing is on the high side but worth it. The only negative is that it is noisy. Not a place for a quiet lunch or dinner.",1
8046,The stuffed Squid is phenomenal. Ask for extra dipping bread for the fava and chermoula spreads. Delectable,1
8047,"Very nice atmosphere. The servers were very polite and knew the menu. Food was all ""shareable"" and delicious. Fantastic wine/beer/cocktail menu. I wish I would have taken pictures of our food! The desert we had was amazing - the Sicilian Iris",1
8048,"Purple Pig is a favorite with foodies in Chicago, but I've unfortunately had mixed experiences there. The first night, my wife and I stopped late for dessert and got a spot at the bar right away. The bartender we had was wonderful and helped us with recommendations, both on the desserts and drinks. Loved it and couldn't wait to return. Then we came back for an early dinner and the service almost killed it. We were seated, and for a good 20-25 minutes we didn't even have someone come over to the table to say ""hi,"" though we noticed other people seated later already being served. When we finally ate, the dishes were hit and miss. The charred cauliflower was great, but many of the other menu items we sampled (five or six) weren't anything to write home about. Moreover, after being to other small plates restaurants that have done it better, I was bummed that there wasn't a little more guidance as to how much to order or the size of particular dishes (some are a couple bites, while others could easily fill someone up on their own). Again, this may have been more of a service things, as we had to repeat portions of our order over and over to a waitress who only seemed to be half paying attention, but we wound up with much more food that we had intended, and much of it wasn't as good as we had expected. But in addition to portion sizes being a bit unpredictable, it wasn't really paced in any way. After visiting Ada St. and seeing them pace the courses very well, and after visiting The Publican and seeing the menu organized better based on size, it was hard to enjoy the trip back to The Purple Pig.",1
8049,"Incredible, as always! Consistency and extremely high quality is a given here, and the entire restaurant is staffed by overachievers.",1
8050,Fantastic food. Great atmosphere.,1
8051,The food and wait staff were wonderful.  The only thing that hold it back from 5 stars is the atmosphere.  It feels like a chain along the lines of an Outback Steakhouse.,1
8052,"We always love the Purple Pig! It is our favorite Chicago restaurant! Every dish is excellent and the staff is extremely helpful and positive. Oh and every wine is excellent too. This time we had a late lunch featuring Chicpea Foccacia smear, Ricotta Gnocchi,  Octopus, and Turkey Leg Confit!!",1
8053,"I want to try this place, we tried a bunch of different things.. Ribs was OK didn't care for the pasta or the shoulder.. The bacon wrap shrimp was the worst. All I can say is the only thing we liked was the bread.",0
8054,"Chicago is a great food city, and The Purple Pig is a standout among the great. The menu includes many delicious options the atmosphere is great as well. The restaurant is unique in that they have many long tables and you will dine alongside others so it is a fun place to go with a group of people. Many of the dishes are shareable and that allows you to try many of the delicious menu options.",1
8055,"Must try... Keep an open mind if you’re tagging along with a foodie friend!! I had and can highly recommend the fried pigs ear, broccoli, and cheese plates. The cheese crackers alone will have you wanting to return. Busy but good service. Decent wines by the glass, too!!",1
8056,"The place looks great, and the waitress was great at the beginning, but once we placed an order - completely forgot about us. We got the main dish before the appetizers, and they just pushed it on our table and left us to handle the plates organization on our own. :/ The food is so-so, good but I wouldn't say amazing. Great selection of wines though!",1
8057,We stopped in for dinner around 8 on a Monday night. There was a short wait and we were seated quickly. The service was spot on and the food was tremendous. I only wish our party was bigger so that we could have tried more dishes. Portions were ample and the prices were fair especially considering the downtown location. We will definitely be back.,1
8058,"Rarely eat red meat these days but will absolutely gorge when I come here. Great charcuterie selection, awesome wines.
Honestly can't remember what we ate but all delicious.
Love the view of the river. Love bringing out of town friends here.
We usually hop onto the river architecture tour that's just around the block.
No reservations so I always arrive close to opening (11am?) and am usually seated within 15mins.",1
8059,YUMO!!!  Great food and atmosphere  a must stop if you are in Chicago .,1
8060,Great place to enjoy delicious food. The octopus and the pork belly were delicious. The garlic broccoli and the 3 way mushrooms too. Hard to decide which one is better.,1
8061,"My taste buds are similar to that of an 8-year old (I'm 100% happy with chicken fingers, burgers, and fries), so I'm always hesitant to try nicer restaurants. However, this place was great and I found plenty of items that I liked. I think it was a Wednesday night when I went and it was PACKED. The food was great and reasonably priced -- 4 of us ate for $120 before tip and that included 2 desserts. I definitely suggest ordering several dishes for your group so you can try a little bit of everything. The service was amazing. The only feedback I have was that the food could've been a bit warmer.",1
8062,"Fantastic food and atmosphere. We tried a selection of dishes all of which sung with flavour. The calamari, which I was informed is poached in white wine, was a real highlight. However all the dishes were flawless. The staff were polite and knew the menu well. A great dining experience.",1
8063,"Every morsel of every dish is an amazing delight. Don't be afraid to let your waitor guide you through the epic culinary experience.

It's a bit noisy inside, and a bit crowded, but the dining experience overcomes any other distractions. Highly recommend.",1
8064,"If you do not mind sharing a table with strangers, go for a great food experience. Imaginative and tasty, upscale but unpretentious and deceptively simple, the food at the Purple Pig might not be for everyone. If you are the grilled chicken breast type, or a vegetarian or vegan, it might not be the place for you. But-if you appreciate pork in all its glory, nasty bits and all, by all means do not miss the experience.",1
8065,"If you have the chance to get a table here I highly suggest you do it! Normally there are long lines or wait times to get in, but if you arrive right when they open you can usually get a spot. The food here is on a level above most other restaurants in the city. We used to come here just for the hummus and pork jowl sandwiches. When they took the hummus off the menu we started trying new things and realized that everything they sell is fantastic. The bone marrow is excellent, and maybe our new favorite dish. Come in the summer for the outdoor experience over the river.",1
8066,"Wonderful experience! As always, great food, service and atmosphere!! So when was the last time you had the opportunity to try Sweet Corn Ice Cream?!? Ha! So our waiter recommended the dessert; we made a bet and he offered to buy it for me if I didn't like it... Well between my husband and I, we ate every bite!! Delicious and extremely definitely different!!! Wonderful!!!",1
8067,We had the meat platter for $50 and it was an amazing experience. Meat sweats all round! Wine was around $60 per bottle. Great service. Atmosphere was great! We loved the place and it was the 300th place we had been to as a couple (yes we keep a list!) It lived up to that lofty accomplishment.,1
8068,"Get the bone marrow spread, it's to die for and the best item on the menu. I got the pigs ear and it was crispy to perfection and paired with the most delicious kale salad. Great atmosphere and great food overall. Great portions too, the bone marrow was enough to get me to a content full. Get there early to grab seats and get a cocktail while you're at it. I got the IPA Float and it was SO GOOD!",1
8069,"Delicious food across the board - salt-roasted beets were an excellent starter, the pork kabobs and chicken thighs were melt-in-your-mouth perfection. Unfortunately, the tables are so jam-packed that it feels really crowded and loud, which isn't the atmosphere I want with such great food.",1
8070,"Really enjoyed our dinner tonight. Absolutely fantastic food! Smaller portions to share but very reasonably priced and left feeling full and happy. Didn't partake in wine but had an extensive selection. Highly recommend, but they don't take reservations so plan accordingly.",1
8071,"Ridiculously good food. I had the charred cauliflower and pork belly, both were near incredible. Portions were generally really good, so this place works well too share plates. If you can sit at the bar by the open kitchen do that, those guys are magicians.",1
8072,They have a diverse menu and everything is exceptional.  The ambiance is nice. It is a very lively place. Easy to order several small plates to share so you can try more than one dish. I have been there twice and will absolutely be back next time I am in Chicago!,1
8073,"Fantastic, amazing, delectable, scrumptious. The food is extraordinary but The Purple Pig is not pretentious. We ordered the smoked tongue, which was divine (sorry no pic of this but it was exquisite), the green beans (so delicious), and smoked turkey leg (big enough for two, fall off the bone, flavorful and not even a teensy bit dry). I'm confident everything on the menu is magnificent. And the quality for the price is right on.",1
8074,"I have to start by saying that this place is a hole in the wall, which makes it an extremely crowded place. I was intimidated by the amount of people inside the restaurant and outside. We decided to give it a try since we wanted something different from our usual dinner choices.

I am glad we got passed the accommodations, which are by no means ideal, as we had to seat on a large, stool high table with a bunch of other strangers. The food was absolutely worth it.

We ordered three dishes from the ""a la plancha"" section of the menu. The milk braised pork shoulder was so tender, that we didn't need a knife and was surrounded by a deliciously gravy drenched mash potatoes. The meatballs were very soft and flavorful as were the chicken kabobs. Portions were perfect for sharing but definitely work as a standalone meal.

Awesome food and now that I know they make tasty stuff, I may get more adventurous choices like pork sweet breads or pig tail.",1
8075,Bone marrow was spectacular!,1
8076,"My wife and a friend went on a Sunday, about 8 PM. We were told it would be a 60 to 90 minute wait. After 30 minutes we got the call, but we were on a nearby rooftop having a drink so it took us 20 minutes to get back. When we got there we had to wait ten minutes, and then were seated in the ""private dining room"", next door, which I do not recommend. It's basically a bunch of wobbly tables under a tarp, with a bad draft. In retrospect we should have left right away, but it was 9PM and we had heard good things about the food. I ordered cheese and prosciutto to start - portions were laughably small. We then ordered lamb, gnocchi, secreto, ribs, and two bottles of wine. The food was underwhelming - too sweet or too salty, with just enough on the plate that it wasn't insulting. Service was good. I left feeling disappointed and won't go back.",0
8077,"Superb service, a rotating menu, and exceptional dishes make this a perfect place to go out for a special occasion. 2 of the small plates would satisfy most people, 4 to 5 is enough for you, your partner, and dinner the next day.

The cheese and charcuterie selection was carefully curated and came with condiments that paired impeccably. The wine list was extensive and the options by the glass were top class. The prepared dishes were wide ranging and of very high quality.

Honestly, this is my new gold standard for a medium priced date spot.",1
8078,"This is our favorite restaurant in Chicago. We have never had a bad experience in over 20 visits. Couple of things to know...

Yes, there will be a wait. Maybe a long one. And they don't take reservations. This place is popular for a reason.
The food is amazing. Reviews that state otherwise don't know what they are talking about or had an outlier experience.
Yes, it can get crowded. It is a restaurant in River North. If you want a lot of room, go to the Olive Garden in the burbs.

Go here.",1
8079,Really great find in the heart of the city. Delicious food and great staff!!!!,1
8080,Food top tier.  The pork secreto was best pork I've ever had I swear! Their signature dessert tastes like cookie dough in a warm crust also amazing. Only criticism is it's loud so not very intimate.  I did enjoy meeting new people at our shared table. Good wine and coffee selection also.,1
8081,Amazing food and service.  Love the space and service was incredible,1
8082,"Great food. Waiter was uptight, needs to chill out",1
8083,Amazing food and fast service. Place is bustling and noisy- we almost chose to go somewhere else because of this but the food was so good that I’m SO happy we did not miss out on this experience. Great job to the kitchen who did an amazing job with the overall flavour of our food and consistency between each dish. I don’t normally eat duck and was reluctant to get it here but it ended up being one of the most memorable dishes I’ve had and my favourite by far of the night.,1
8084,"Everything was so salty, I left not impressed and bloated. I don’t recommend. The only things we like during dinner was whipped feta, beets, and ribs. Avoid the lamb shank, terrible.",1
8085,"Amazing food and a nice vibe, although I could have used a bit more elbow room.  There is a great selection of meats  for your charcuterie pleasure and an equally impressive amount of artisan cheeses.  The roasted bone marrow is to die for and the milk braised shoulder was fantastic.  Service was good, reasonably attentive.  Great spot for lunch or dinner!",1
8086,"We were originally greeted by our server, however through the course of the meal our server only appeared three times. Other staff had checked in more than our actual server. The food was good except the scallops that still had sand in them. $25 dollars for three scallops that were sandy was disgusting. Everything else was really good however, the steak was amazing. The dining room was also extremely loud and for two people to be able to have a dinner date made it irritable when we had to practically yell at each other to hear. I understand that scallops, clams etc may have a little sand, sure, but to not have good service from your waiter made the dinner worse. Would return if service is better.",0
8087,"We waited for an hour while we sampled a wine from the extensive (and interesting) list in the Purple Pig, and we made some decisions about the food. I was surprised to see a wide variety of wines and, even more surprising, beers from my corner of Spain (Galicia).

I come from a place were the pig is a fundamental part of the diet and the culture, and it takes some effort to impress me with pork based dishes. Well, I was impressed. I was impressed with the sophistication and the execution of every one of the dishes we shared. The flavors blended in unexpected, but cleverly thought, ways that made you always want another taste.

The decor was simple but made the place comfortable, and the common high tables are a great idea. The ambience was so relaxed that it was a pleasure to simply sit there. The acoustics were good, and we could maintain a conversation without shouting, and barely noticing our table neighbors. The waitress we had was efficient, knowledgeable and attentive.

If I could give this place 4/3 instead of 3/3 I would. It is uncommon to find places were the food has this quality and the ambience is this relaxed. I loved every minute of it.",1
8088,"Cool location inside an office building with extensive wine list and great service. Only had an app, the ham and cheese croquettes, and these were great! Menu looked quite good and tempting but had already made dinner plans elsewhere. Would be in the list to return next time in town.",1
8089,"It's more of a casual place to eat, but the food was very good. The Tuna tartare was delicious, and the duck is a definite plate you should order.",1
8090,"Staff is nice, and they are honest about the wait times.       The waiter seemed disappointed that we didn't order wine.

It's so loud, forget about having a conversation or hearing your waiter.    The Spanish Octopus was tough, requiring a knife to eat.    The overwhelming and only flavor was char.   Not good.

There is no kids menu, and they charge $19 for a charred hot dog!

The pork options are surprisingly limited.    A dive BBQ restaurant blows Purple Pig out of the water in every way when it comes to pork/meat.    Why is this restaurant so busy?",0
8091,"Okay tail to snout

Despite the classification, this is neither a Mediterranean nor a tapas restaurant. The menu, at least the lunch menu is a mixed influence tail to snout offering of all things pork, plus other proteins including fish and chicken. The portions are too small to be mains, and simply too large to be called tapas. Presentation was nice and flavours were good, but nothing in particular impressed. The door service was unwelcoming and were it not for a referral from a friend, we would have simply walked away. Service at the bar where we chose to sit, versus the communal dining throughout much of the restaurant, was thankfully better. If you enjoy a meat rich menu and exploring different parts of the animal, make it past the door and you may be pleasantly surprised.",1
8092,The Purple Pig didn't do it for me.  Came with my wife and daughter.  We ordered 4 items per our servers recommendation.  The beef shoulder was excellent.  The other three were just ok.  The cod and egg dish was basically an omelette with very little fish.  Wine starts at $42 a bottle which I should have ordered instead I took our servers recommendation on a $55 bottle.  Apparently we mistakingly gave me a much more expensive bottle.  They corrected the bill but it was super dry and tannin.  Didn't care for it.,1
8093,Awesome  food,1
8094,"The food is so delicious I suggest you try the home made hotdog. They currently have a whipped feta dish that's so creamy. Just be prepared to spend $ me and my bf ordered 4 dishes (and shared them all because it's like ""small plate"" portion size) and 2 alcoholic beverages each. Our bill was $165 with 20% tip.",1
8095,"The waiter I had was excellent!  He was very attentive without being intrusive and was willing to explain food items, had a really nice attitude to top it off!  I'm sorry, I forgot to get his name.  I was in today, Wednesday afternoon around 12:30 pm.  He was an African American gentleman who wore glasses.   The food was just a little too salty for my taste, I had the blade pork but the presentation and service were very good.",1
8096,We called in here for an early dinner after a day of sight seeing and it didn’t disappoint. I’m glad we went early because it got very busy but the service was good and the food arrived quickly. The idea is that you share dishes and they come out when ready. The portions are large so don’t so don’t order too many at once. The chicken thigh kebabs were lovely.,1
8097,"Greasy food sprouts and pigs ear, seemingly old cow acquired for beef, and salmon was thoroughly overcooked with eclectic flavored sauces. Bustling restraunt, though management did notice when I almost threw up from the fried deviled egg and reduced part of the bill. It is definitely not a flavor profile I would try again, though others may have more refined tastes and have a more pleasurable experience.",0
8098,Very nice place and well located. It gets  so busy for lunch time. Friendly staff and well presented dishes. A bit pricey though.,1
8099,"Food was tasty and served with a smile. However, it was my first and only time that I will ever eat there. Why? I don't like my side dish coming out 15 minutes before my entree appears. When I asked about that I was told the chef likes things to be brought out separately and shared. I want my side with my entree. Nothing about this place said it was a tapas-style restaurant before I walked in. Due to the fact that each side between myself and my guest were brought out at different times, and then each entree was brought out at different times, neither of us appreciated that style. Of course the chef has the right to dictate how we eat in his restaurant, I have right to dictate that I won't return. You also need to be willing to deal with communal seating. This was not an issue. How every restaurant was very loud. Again, everything was quite tasty. The server only dropped off food I never saw them until they dropped off the check.",1
8100,Pork belly was the best I’ve ever had!,1
8101,"You are in for a treat at this outstanding restaurant. Fabulous menu, great wait staff and a very swanky atmosphere. I had the prime rib sandwich and my husband had the filet. Both were one of the very best meals we have had on our mission to find the best steak! Make a reservation today, as this place books up..",1
8102,"The wait was super long (2 hours), but the food may be worth the wait for most. The style is similar to Girl & The Goat, there are when some overlapping dishes such as the pig face & egg.

For people who want to try this place but are too hungry to withstand the wait, I recommend putting your name down (they'll text you when it's ready) and heading down to nearby Billy Goat Tavern for a cheap & pretty good cheeseburger",1
8103,"Wow, this is a scam! On Friday night, his friends came and said the waiting time for the car is 45 minutes. We got to the next bar to drink a cup. The food was unbelievable! We have many dishes and beers. We really like crispy pork and eggs and cabbage ears (good)!!!!) There's a potato porridge. We also bought some Italian sausage, lavender, cabbage wine, pork, mashed potatoes and gravy (the flesh is very tender and tasty, and the broccoli is very sour. In short, food ratios and try a new and tasty place! This place quickly became the favorite place to eat. Teamwork Very friendly and cooperative. This place of its effectiveness is a masterpiece. Salt of beet baked better, zucchini and very tasty pumpkins.",1
8104,Great generally but little salty for some people,1
8105,"So good! I had the milk braised pork shoulder. It's served to you with a spoon because it's just so perfectly tender. I cleaned my plate. Would 100% recommend!

Seems to get pretty busy. So be aware of that and try calling ahead.",1
8106,We called in here for an early dinner after a day of sight seeing and it didn’t disappoint. I’m glad we went early because it got very busy but the service was good and the food arrived quickly.

8107,"Interesting dishes meant be be shared. It was loud but because it was busy. Great dishes. We had the beats, octopus, and pigs ears....it was all very good. Well worth the visit.",1

8109,"Service was impeccable well versed and knowledgeable staff. Pork belly is amazing with extraordinary flavors. The bone marrow was well accompanied with cilantro and kosher salt. The servers will help pair wine and food. There is a lengthy wait, but worth it.",1
8110,Stuffed squid is excellent!... Update..  dessert platter Isa great way to try a little bit of everything. Enough for sharing.,1
8111,"A piquant experience. I will be going back to the purple pig probably any time I visit Chicago. This one should be included as one of the cynosures of the city. Amazing food, great ambience. Please reserve it in advance. And also it's expensive but I didn't mind forking up a little for the quality of service I received.",1
8112,"Even at 2:00pm on a Monday, this place was crowded, but that's how amazing the food at this place is! There wasn't any wait at all and food came surprisingly quick! I love broccoli and this place had the best I've tasted of this tasty vegetable. The ribs were soft and delicious. The cheeses seemed to be worth another visit.",1
8113,"One of the top restaurant experiences of my life. Beautiful dishes, truly worth the money.",1
8114,"Disclaimer: I eat kosher. I.e - I do not eat pork and usually try to make sure not to eat dairy and meat.
Surprisingly, I found a lot that I couldn't eat in The Purple Pig and it was REALLY good.",1

8116,"Must eats if visiting Chicago, plates are meant to be shared.",1
8117,"Right in the downtown area of Chicago this cozi restaurant exceeded our expectations. With a friendly staff and amazing servers we had a delight selections of dishes (including vegan friendly options made by request and specially made by the chef). All dishes were super tasty and perfect for sharing (as our server suggested). On top of that they have a pretty good wine selection and good beers. For the quality of the food and service price was fair!
Definitely a place to check when in Chicago.",1
8118,Good food however a table of 9 received food over a 35 minute time frame so most were finished before the last meals arrived. not great timing of the kitchen. They did offer a drink because of the long wait but charged for it anyway.,1
8119,"Pork dishes are great !! The sauce on lamb ribs is too strong & sour. The ravioli was OK... we had the Iris for dessert... that was OK, too. Very good wine selection! Probably wouldn't go back but it was nice to try it out!",1
8120,"Very impressed. Not the biggest servings, so you order a variety of things then share. I went with a friend, and we shared the broccoli appetizer, she had the quail egg ravioli, and I had the pork shoulder. All were very good, and quite filling. The food was rich and flavorful, and something special.",1
8121,"New place is wonderful! It has the same atmosphere of former location just bigger and better. I asked to sit at the bar by the chef's area and had the pleasure of seeing Jimmy and his team work. What a show...
I could go on and on about The Pig.
Atmosphere, service, food, wine and people you meet are fantastic.
I will always stop by when in town!",1

8123,Very good food! Most of the dishes come in small servings so you may need to add a vegetable side dish to your entree but overall very good.,1
8124,"I always enjoy going to The Purple Pig when I am in Chicago. Certain things our party ordered were wonderful on my latest visit, notably the braised pork shoulder and beets with goat cheese and pistachio. This time, however, there was a big flaw. The pork blade steak was tender, juicy, flavourful - and absurdly salty. Might I suggest to the chef that he use less salt in the brine? Everything else about our experience was great.",1
8125,"Was very busy so we had to stand in the heated patio. Waist up we were warm but our feet got pretty cold by the end of dinner. Menu was very diverse and had lots of unique dishes. My favorite plate of the night was the octopus, highly recommend it!",1
8126,"One of the most amazing dining experiences you’ll ever encounter. Eclectic and delicious menu, extensive and delicious wine list and super passionate staff. If you can, sit at the bar and ask Alan to pair your food and wine- he is a master at both!",1
8127,"One of the best pork restaurants I’ve ever been to. From the pig ears to the braised shoulder to the pork tenderloin, all of it was expertly cooked for an awesome price for what you’re getting. The service was also excellent and knowledgeable about all the items on the menu. If you’re in Chicago, you need to go to the Purple Pig!",1
8128,"Even though you can’t make reservations, the wait is well worth it! They make getting in the que easy; just leave your name and a cell number and they will call you when they are ready to seat you. We took our server’s advice and ordered a vegetable and entree each and had plenty of food for sharing and even some left overs. I will definitely return to try even more of this inspired and pleasing food offering.",1
8129,We had to try 3 different times to get a table without having to wait well over an hour. But it was so worth it. I'm not a particularly adventurous eater so was a bit concerned about the descriptions of some of the dishes but they were all superb - the best tasting food I've had anywhere. Go early if you want to be seated quickly.,1
8130,"Delicious plates to share. Uppish scale wine bar yet cozy with *delicious* food. It's a little cramped inside but it's a very nice place, friendly wait staff, and they are on top of your water and clearing your plates! There is outside seating too if you're brave enough.",1
8131,"We had an amazing experience while celebrating my father's birthday. Our server, Victor, was incredibly helpful with the wine list and was very knowledgable about the wines we were interested in. Service makes or breaks the experience in any restaurant and Victor nailed it. The food, of course, was ridiculously good. We left fully satisfied and my dad's birthday was perfect.",1
8132,"Despite the wait & attitude from some of the staff. I really enjoyed my experience here. Their portions for each dish is definitely shareable among 2-4 people. For 2, we got about 5 dishes and were pretty satisfied by then end. Some of their noteworthy dishes include the Potato Ice Cream, Clam & Cuttlefish Brodetta, and Octopus.",1
8133,This place is definitely worth the visit! Came here for lunch on a Saturday and the wait wasn't too bad. (30 min for a party of 4)  Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder was so tender that it could be cut with merely a fork and Grilled Broccoli so incredibly flavorful. We will surely be paying another visit next time we're in Chicago! Thanks for having us!,1
8134,"When I first got there, I thought it would be one of those fancy/gourmet/kinda arrogant restaurants with weird and pricey food. I couldn't be wronger. They have very distinguished food combination but everything is delicious. We could share great food suggested by the hostess and we were delighted with each dish that was served to us. Even in the New Year's Eve rush they were able to accommodate a small group with no reservation and without waiting. This was one of my best experiences in Chicago.",1
8135,"Crowded. Loud. Expensive

The waiter started out by telling us usually people order two dishes each. Then why is it priced like as if each item is a full meal? And why is it two dollar signs????

I had the pork belly in ginger sauce. It was very good. But I will not be coming back here. It is way too loud and too crowded. I had to wait 2h to get a table. The food is pretentious and small, but the environment is chaotic.",1
8136,"Purple Pig is hands down one of the best restaurants in Chicago. They have  a massive wine list, masterly crafted cocktails, and a regularly rotating menu that's well suited for sharing. Some of my personal favorites are the pork shoulder, the half duck confit, and the meatballs. With the menu changing often some of these items may be rotated out but you can't go wrong with just about anything on the menu. All of the dishes are well thought out and provide an incredible experience for your mouth from start to finish. The only downside is that you can always expect to wait for a table, they are usually packed from open to close.",1
8137,"Great wine, great food, great service. Come hungry! The food in this place comes with an extra dude of a great experience. Our server, Adam, was attentive, gave us great wine suggestions, and was otherwise perfect. If I was a local, I'd make this place my favorite restaurant. Try the pork fat almonds! Those were amazing!!! And, don't be afraid at the missing prices on the website, most plates go between $8-20 and are meant to be shared, so not too expensive at all.",1
8138,"We had gotten a recomendation to come here and it did not dissappoint. Their style of service is not traditional in they bring the plate as it's ready, not in courses. We all ordered different dishes and shared them. By far the consesnus of the group was that the pork belly was the best dish we tasted. Dessert was also very good.",1
8139,"This place is worth the hype. The food is amazing and the wine is great. I wish the portions were a little bigger, but the flavor makes up for it. I will definitely be visiting here again when I come back in town.",1
8140,My husband and I had dinner at the purple pig last night. The drinks are excellent. The 1/2 duck my husband had was wonderful. I had the lamb chops and side of broccoli as well. The waitress we had was wonderful. Wonderful dessert menu as well.,1
8141,"Let me start by saying I have never written a review of a restaurant because I've never felt implored or been SO wowed by a place, until now. Went to Chicago for my birthday weekend, a surprise trip from my boyfriend. We were there for 3 days, and of all the places we ate, this was BY FAR THE BEST! To be honest, this was THE BEST FOOD IVE EVER HAD, and by far the best quality for the price! We called ahead, they don't take reservations, and for good reason, that place is swarming with people.  We were told it would take 45mins to 1hr to be seated, but we had no where to be and decided to go and wait.  As soon as we walked in, the polite hostess informed us 2 spots at the bar had just opened, so we grabbed them.  It being my birthday, I wanted a new kind of drink, the waiter had the bartender whip up something special for me, it was DELICIOUS! Our waiter gave so many recommendations, and was incredibly sweet, joking, and chatting with us when he had some spare seconds. After raving about the food and our experience, the manager came out to talk with us as well. I could NOT believe food of that quality was so AFFORDABLE especially downtown in a major city! My TOP recommendation for dining in Chicago.",1
8142,"Fun, bustling restaurant. Food is amazing, especially if you love meat/pork. Chef is Greek so there’s a Greek flair to dishes. Sitting at the bar or the chef’s table is best if you want to be part of the action. A great Chicago staple (weird office building entrance tho).",1
8143,"Good late night food. Dishes are on the smaller side, but very tasty.",1
8144,"I think this place is overrated.  The wait was long even though we came at 5pm.  It was fine since we weren't that hungry so we waited.  We ordered the prosciutto stuffed squid, turkey leg, and milk fed suckling pig leg and belly.  The squid was salty beyond belief that I had to drink a whole glass of water to eat it.  The pig leg and belly was not seasoned and tasted pretty bland.  There was supposed to be bone marrow sauce but I tasted none of it.  The turkey leg was probably the best dish.  It was a generous portion since it's the whole leg and it was flavorful,  I liked the crispy lentils that came with the dish.  Overall, the food was definitely disappointing.  It was quite busy so the service was lacking as well.  We had to wait a long time for everything from water to the check.  Also, the bathrooms were ridiculous.  There are only 3 stalls for men and women so the line was really long.  I'm never coming back to this restaurant.",0
8145,"The food here is amazing, as well as the service. The gnocchi and the octopus are to die for, definitely recommend getting these two for sure. So well done!! The drinks were ok but the food was definitely the show stopper.",1
8146,"I don't usually write reviews but this one is worth the time. First come, first serve makes a great policy for one of Chicago's best Mediterranean restaurants. We were a party of three in a Thursday night and got a table under 10 minutes and yes, the restaurant was at its fullest... Great vibe and the loudness is just right! You can hear people having a great time, laughing and clinking glasses. The ambience is just right for a late dinner night in a cozy room. Service is excellent and the waiters will not hesitate to make you feel at home. As for the food, I we ordered the salmon, the milk braised pork shoulder and the chicken thigh kebab. Would have expected slightly larger portions but they are just right if you're just hungry and not too hungry...the pork was definitely the best,. Tender, moist and absolutely delicious with those crispy lentils on top! Prices are very fair for the quality ratio. Each course is 20 USD on average. Drinks can start around 8 for a beer or 10 for a glass of wine... As for desserts, I was a bit disappointed when they told they had just run out of creme brulee however the fried Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Brioche was excellent! Definitely worth every penny

Avg. Price: 45-60 per person (including tax and tip)
Dress code: Casual",1
8147,"What a great little find. The restaurant was crowded, but we also had more than enough comfortable space. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the food was fantastic! The group of 4 of us ordered about 6 things, shared those, and that more than filled us up. I will definitely be stopping in our next time in Chicago!",1
8148,"Purple Pig is crazy. It's usually packed and loud with every spare space utilized. It's a small-plate restaurant, so two people should order at least three things. Food comes out as it's ready so there's no order to the experience, but usually only one item at a time so the table doesn't get crowded and food doesn't get cold.
Staff hustles and food is always solidly great, there's always an interesting note of flavor in each dish.
Nothing seems too expensive, except maybe the wine, but with a variety you'll leave stuffed.
Beet salad was amazing, English muffin, too.",1
8149,"Totally delicious experience up in this place. Got treated to a little plate of olives while we waited for a seat at the bar, where we feasted on their paté, cauliflower and half duck. All of it was top notch. As was the service and atmosphere.

Will be coming back to finish that duck one day.",1
8150,"Sat at the bar. Ate well. Great attentive staff. Crispy kale pig ear bowl is still amazing after all these years. And bone marrow delicious. Burrata was so good, light and fluffy. Pate, we didn't care for - strong flavor and texture different. It was good , just our taste.",1
8151,"I was unsure about The Purple Pig at first, I thought maybe they were trying to make a 5 star dining experience using peculiar food, which just didn't sound authentic to me. However my visit there was nothing short of amazing. Their twist on otherwise simple italian food added so much extra flavor, some of which I'd never experienced before. After a pretty big meal there (there portions were pretty large compared to what I'm used to eating on my own) I had a coffee to help sink in the food coma. That was really one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had in my life. I still think about it now, and this dining experience was well over a month ago. The service was great, the meal was great, the atmosphere was enjoyable, it was overall a great dining experience.",1
8152,"Great place with very creative dishes. The staff was all very friendly and attentive. Portions were well sized and prices very reasonable.

They don't take reservations though so you need to put your name down and they will text you.",1
8153,"Went to the Pig Saturday night....it was fun with friendly people, great food and an intriguing menu.  Had the fried olives and cauliflower which were great.  The saganaki was delicious...Try the Iris, a creme and chocolate-stuffed puff pastry served hot.  It was outstanding. It's communal seating which was fun as we met a nice couple from the city plus you can see what everybody else is eating and say ""I'll have what their having"".  It's loud, boisterous and a unique dining experience.  Go early otherwise it's a wait. Mike was our waiter and he was very helpful with the menu selection. Five stars!!",1
8154,"Amazing experience. Knowing it was our first time, most of the waitstaff was patient and informative. The hostess rolled her eyes when the 4 of us asked to sit directly across from each other. Only reason why it's not 5 stars for me. Yum to the food and wine! Cool spot.",1
8155,Bone marrow is on our table as an appetizer when ever we dine at Purple Pig (at least twice a month). There is no wrong order either. Pick any meal and you will love it. I suggest putting yourself in the queue 30 minutes to an hour before your planned time. Due to it's proximity to Michigan Ave there are plenty of windows to browse while waiting for your table. We loved our every visit and plan to come back for more.,1
8156,"Service was awesome. Not once had to ask for anything, not even refills. The Chicken Thigh Kebabs were superb ! The shorts ribs fell right off the bone melted right in your mouth. Highly recommended place !!!",1
8157,"Had dinner at the Purple Pig for the first time in a long time and I'm quite glad I returned as the food was terrific, wine stellar, and service excellent (Thank you Krystina!). Will be back soon!",1
8158,"Oh man, so much flavor, I love this place. They have a great wine selection 🍷. It's a rich kind of meal so expect a lot of decadence and butter. Loved the bone marrow, fried machego cheese and the broccoli. It's not a bad wait if you have 2 people. Large groups should come early to get a table at dinner time. There are no call ahead reservations, just show up and put your name in, and you better be back exactly in 15 cuz I was there at exactly 15 and they almost didn't give me a table. Nice spot downtown though worth the hassle. 🕯️",1
8159,"We waited for more than one hour but it's totally worth the wait. Even as a vegetarian, the food blows my mind. The cheese and wine are also really delicious. I've been to many tapa places but this one is definitely on the top of the list. I wish to come back to try their desert another time.",1
8160,Try the bone marrow appetizer with the Lambrusco sparkling red wine. Sublime!,1
8161,"Went for a late night dinner with friends on the recommendation of one of their friends. It was a cool night and the place was hoppin' . We had only a short wait and were sat on the patio which was enclosed and had a bunch of heaters as well so we were all toasty.
The waiter was friendly and informative and described each dish and how it would be served. It was not a formal serving and dishes were shared by all and arrived hot when they were ready. we tried 6 different dishes between the 4 of us and raved about the great flavours and uniqueness of each one. wish the appetite had held out to try more but we will be back to do this one again. Definitely would recommend this one to a friend.",1
8162,Lively restaurant with great small plates and an extensive wine list. I would love to see a broader selection of beers but you can't have it all! Everything I've tried has been enjoyable but the pork fat fried almonds and pork belly were superior. The Sicilian Iris is a can't miss for dessert.,1
8163,"I've never been *deeply* insulted by staff before, this was the worst experience of my life.",0
8164,Fantastic food! We asked for suggestions and our server picked all his favourites for his. He even gave me a delicious wine pairing. As we'd finish one dish they'd clear and bring the next immediately which was great. The lag between the 3rd and 4th dishes was almost 20 minutes though and we didn't really want it at that point. Only the smallest disappointment to an overall amazing experience.,1
8165,"The food was amazing. Beautiful plating, great flavors and options, and wonderful service. It's a very popular place, and has a very loud atmosphere. Great for extroverts who want to get to know new people. However, due to how busy it was, we were seated in the middle two seats of a 14 person table. It was a little awkward to ask other diners to get up to let us slide through to our seats against the wall, and forget about getting out to go to the bathroom (not usually a big deal, but I am pregnant and that's a big concern for me currently).  As an introvert who was tired from a day interacting with strangers at a work conference, this dinner wasn't relaxing, but it sure as heck was delicious!",1
8166,"This place is ridiculously popular for a reason. The food is amazing, the staff is attentive, and the experience is uniquely engaging and immersive.

The Purple Pig is not for anyone stressed by crowds but for adventurous and convivial folks, I highly recommend you sit at the communal table and ask your new neighbors for menu recommendations.",1
8167,"Middle of the road for me. Wine was a bit over priced  (says the wife) and the food was good, very well put together with presentation and the atmosphere was cool. However, the food itself lacked a bit of pizazz far me. The sweet potato polenta was out of this world. It had a variety of different palate notes and such depth of flavor, but the rest of the food wasn’t as tasty. It was very one dimensional.",1
8168,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city! Have come for both lunch to sit at the bar and dinner and both have exceeded expectations. This is a small place where they cook everything on induction burners (fun fact) so it may take a bit to get a table but it's well-worth the wait. Everything is served as small plates so it's meant for sharing but it has a Mediterranean twist (my favorite!). If I had to recommend one thing, it would be the chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki. And I know what you're thinking ""I eat chicken all the time, why would I get it when I go out"" but believe me, it's better than the chicken you eat at home.

Whenever I come back to the city, I will be back!",1
8169,"Simply amazing. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny!! We were referred to here by a friend to visit while we were passing Chicago on our road trip.

My hubby and I ordered uni toast, broccollis, milk braised pork shoulder and octopus. The uni toast was the one that I had the least expectation on since I was a little intimidated by the uni (sea urchin) but it turned out to be the best dish we ordered! Its savory, tangy, sweet and crispy all at the same time in the best of ways. Anyone in doubt, just try it and you'll love it! It's not at all an intimidating taste. It's only two pieces of small toasts so you'll have plenty of room for extra dishes :)

We both very much enjoyed every bite and would love to go back when we have the chance!",1
8170,"So this place is tapas, and wwwaaayyyy more expensive than I was expecting.  For how fancy the food was, it still feels kinda casual.  Maybe like a business casual kinda place.  We had 3 people and got 4 plates to share.  The food was supreme.  They recommended the shoulder and it was very tender and delicious.  Service was ok for the fact that it was super busy.  Food came out one plate at a time, without too much time between plates as we shared them.  Dividing between 4 people might be a little thin.  Wine pricing was rediculous, even for Chicago.  Great place if you get a chance to stop in.  I would hit it up for a light meal, but wouldn't stick around too long.",1
8171,"This is an amazing place to enjoy Chicago.  The service is amazing. The staff know how to entertain as well as make suggestions for food and drink. I have never been so memorized by a venue.
The wine list is expansive and the staff have an amazing knowledge if you find it overwhelming (which I did) and I was able to have great selection with my app, meal and desert.  THANK YOU TO THR ATTENTIVE STAFF.
My only complaint is the lacking bathrooms, but that will be resolved once they move to a bigger location (happening soon, rumor has it)",1
8172,"Just come here and ask something random from the menu, every plate looks delicious and the 2 I had were incredible.

Only bad is the lack of enough bathrooms.",1
8173,"Amazing restaurant with refreshing and creative greasy dishes, just the way you like it. Yet it is also elegant with awesome drink list, making it an ideal location for a date night or warming yourself up in the frigid Chicago winter. The wait is the only complaint.",1
8174,The food was awesome. It's a place where you can share all with your friends.,1
8175,One of the best restaurants I have ever been,1
8176,"Wow, this is a scam! On Friday night, his friends came and said the waiting time for the car is 45 minutes. We got to the next bar to drink a cup. The food was unbelievable! We have many dishes and beers. We really like crispy pork and eggs and cabbage ears (good)!!!!) There's a potato porridge. We also bought some Italian sausage, lavender, cabbage wine, pork, mashed potatoes and gravy (the flesh is very tender and tasty, and the broccoli is very sour. The work team is very friendly. This place of its efficacy is a masterpiece. Salt of beet baked bread better, zucchini and percussion are very tasty.",1
8177,Food was good. Although the squid was tough and turkey leg sooo salty .This is not a place to go if you plan on talking to your dining mates. Very hip and lively. And oh yeah over 1000 wines to choose from,1
8178,They moved accross the street but the quality followed with them.  Love this restaurant!,1
8179,"Well, as with so many of these tapas-style places, it's easy to rack up a bill if you're too liberal with ordering.  And it's hard not to be, with so many fabulous options!!  I'm a vegetarian for goodness' sake, and I still found more things that I longed for than I had appetite or funds to pull off.  Interesting flavour combinations, friendly service, great drinks list, fun vibe.",1
8180,Wow the food here is insane. Everything we had was great. Food hits your table pretty fast for how busy it can be. If you're doing a tasting tour go here last. The big in your face flavors and execution will ruin anywhere you go afterwards. Hands down a 5 star spot if the service team was better.,1
8181,"Amazing food/wine options but why do they not take reservations?? I came here once on a January Sunday at 12:30pm and we got a table. This place is super tiny so since then, as the weather gets better...forget about it. It's their prerogative how they want to handle crowds, but given that most restaurants DO take reservations, I just don't think they are making fans with their long wait times.",1
8182,"Great food, friendly service",1
8183,"I tried everyday I was visiting Chicago to try and get into the purple pig where I was willing to wait if the time was less than 1 hour. I finally got in for a lunch on the 3rd day.

This place is absolutely incredible. The food and service are top notch. You must order the bone marrow. I  would love to come back again, when visiting and get the meat board that the table next to us got. It looked absolutely heavenly + incredible. a *must* go if you are in Chicago, cannot pass it up.",1
8184,The food was excellent and so was the service....definitely a must when in Chicago,1
8185,"I went for lunch today.  I ordered the crispy pigs' ears. It has air fried crispy kale and pepper with a fried egg on the top. The whole dish looks dry, and it tastes salty. Chewing the crispy vegetables is like chewing Korean seaweed. This dish is a bad invention.  I had one bit, and stopped eating. The waiter was nice that he asked me if I'd like to order something else. I ordered a salad. That was a very good salad.",1
8186,Everyone was so friendly. The food was amazing!!! Great hang out joint for a girls trip. You might even get lucky and meet the chef like we did! Would recommend 100%!,1
8187,Top notch food. Pork Belly a basically perfect dish. When a place can make beets taste amazing you know its great. Best place on the MM for the money,1
8188,"I ate at this place while visiting Chicago for dinner and it was amazing.  This is a wonderful place for delicious food and the ambiance is very chill.

Although the food isn't the cheapest around, it's definitely worth every penny, because the food is prepared well and tastes incredible. While this place does a casual feel, it could also make a great date-night place due to the presentation, quality, and service this restaurant provides. My father and I didn't order a full on meal, but rather split a few dishes which were all delicious.

Whether you're stopping by Chicago, need a place to take your date, or just want good food, I'd highly recommend this place to anyone.",1
8189,"Large portions (we ordered four dishes for two people, and couldn’t finish) — the pig ears and octopus were alright, bone marrow was better, and the pork belly was the standout.",0
8190,Really great food!,1
8191,"The Spanish Octopuss was so tender and the pork jowl was bursting with flavor, with finely-sliced mushrooms, and  tomatoes. They showcase a broad wine selection in their (relatively) new location. The joint was full of energy. Service was excellent. 5 stars.",1
8192,"So overrated! I've been wanting to go to this place for about 10 years. During my time in culinary school (~8years ago) I had so many chef friends raving about this place. The food, the wine, the ambiance. Sad to say, it has absolutely nothing now.

Thankfully we did not have a wait, Friday afternoon around 4:30, but the restaurant was busy! The restaurant was super bright, I felt blinded by the spotlights above, it was freezing, most guest had their coats on, and it was loud. I felt like I was having lunch at a mall. Definitely not a cosy date spot, my husband and I just wanted to leave, BUT having waited 10 years to try it out, we needed to see it through.
Three different bussers asked us if we wanted sparkling or still, when we said that someone had already been over to ask, they didn't understand.
Our server was fine but felt rushed. Didn't really get any recommendations or help with what to order, expected especially since allergens aren't represented on the menu. We mostly guessed our way. It seemed expensive but at this point had no idea how large the portions would be. We ordered one vegetable starter, one fish and two meat. Zucchini and halluomi, grilled and then put in the fridge probably over night. It was cold! And it tasted like something you'd get in the cold section at whole foods, not bad, but very simple and kinda boring and definitely not $15 good or whatever. We were very disappointed and didn't finish.
Expected the server to check in but never happened. A new person came and dropped a plate of lamb ribs and took our almost full plate of halluomi salad without a word. I found the coursing  extremely weird, for a place with these prices?
The ribs were okay, fatty and not really impressive. It's very clear that there's no passion in the food at this place, maybe there was at some point years ago, but now I bet it's just low paid staff cooking someone's recipes with no quality control whatsoever. It's what I would expect from a cafeteria, not one of the best restaurants in Chicago. (which it's clearly not anymore)

My husband liked his cocktail, a classic, while my drink was whatever, their own creation. It was clear quickly that this place completely missed the mark on training their staff, I'm sure they hired new with the expansion but that could've been a great opportunity to get things right.
After the two courses we were so disappointed with the food, the service and the ambiance that we just wanted to leave.

I think the Purple Pig has turned into a overpriced tourist trap and you best avoid at all cost. If you're looking for something in a similar price range and don't want to be disappointed, go to Girl and the Goat.",0
8193,"Was visiting Chicago and it was my first time here.  Seems like everyone knew about this place and wow, it lived right up to its reputation!  Tried most of the menu, with my team from work.  Out...standing....  Every single item was beyond delicious and spectacular and for those who like something a little hard to find, the roasted bone marrow was epic!  Appetizers to dessert, this place is noteworthy.  Get here early because the wait will grow very fast.  Order some wine and enjoy the artisanary!",1
8194,"Great place. Food is creative, delicious and portions are large enough to actually enjoy the food rather than just taste it, which is the problem I have with some of the other gastro restaurants. One criticism is that it was a little crowded when we went (tables close together) but as it’s such a popular area and limited space I can’t fault the star rating for this.",1
8195,"we feared the worst, 4 hour waits.  But as it seems, we only waited 25mins 2 days before Thanksgiving!  Open and engaging communal tables on the inside is where you want to be at.  Service was pretty decent with great recommendations, since the menu is quite extensive and caters for all.  Come back here a dozen times, and you would still find 5 dishes that have yet to try.  Food was delicious, with some people across the table recommending the Fried Bone Marrow.  Quail and slow cooked turkey leg were amazing, very impressed with an equally impressive wine list.  Crowd ranges from young to old, and is the place for a social food experience.  Definitely recommend at all costs.",1
8196,"Excellent cocktails and very busy. Recommend putting your name in for a table, then wander around nearby until they text you. The food was of utmost quality, with some adventurous dishes. Brocolli was surprisingly good. Seriously, get it (and I don't even like veggies)",1
8197,"Really great experience. Tried their lamb ribs- found out I love lamb ribs. Skillfully made. Only downside was the ensuing mess, but that's to be expected from ribs!
Employees friendly, though a bit busy as it's a Friday night. Very quick to refill any glasses, it felt like as soon as you set your glass down, it was filled again by a lightning fast waiter. Happy to answer questions about items on the menu.",1
8198,"Had some small plates with some friends here. We ordered the calamari, razor clams, and the pig ears. My favorite dish was actually the calamari. Texture and taste were great. I enjoyed the pig ears, but I thought they were fried a bit too much, making it taste more like a cracker/chip.",1
8199,"Visited on 11/1 for lunch. We were promptly seated and the server immediately turned his attention to us. He recommended dishes and took the time to explain how they were prepared. The dishes are served in the style of a small plate but with a shareable portion. We started with crispy pig ears. They were ok, but the finished product didn't live up to the promise of it's various parts. Everything else was outstanding. Beets with goat cheese, pork shoulder braised in milk, chicken thigh kebabs, roasted cauliflower, fried manchego. Definitely recommend and I will be back.",1
8200,"11pm on a tourist-heavy Saturday in the summer, this place had turned into a hidden little gem. Probably would've hated the crowds I saw earlier in the day, but food, service, atmosphere all just great when we were there. If you like offal (I do) you just have to try the smoked tongue which was stupendous, the crispy pig ears spectacular, bone marrow a classic, and the beef tendon crisps are something I have never seen before. Branch out for the octopus too, worth a trip in its own right.
Very good wine selection. Great service and attitude. I'm coming back!",1
8201,"I completely enjoyed this dining establishment, the food is outstanding, plus the brooms were not bad. It was a little cold indoors, so that was not perfect. The service is great. I will certainly consider going back once again if I get the possibility. Me as well as my friend purchased the combo as well as we were not dissatisfied. My one idea is to maintain the chilly exterior. See you all again.!",1
8202,We ate here while visiting on business. Definitely interesting food and not your standard array of dishes. We weren't sure what to order so had the server bring us what she thought best and what she brought us was delicious!,1
8203,Phenomenal tapas! Had the stuffed squid and it was one of the best things I’ve had thus far. Highly recommended.,1
8204,"Visited in 2015.  What a great and lively restaurant!  Great food.  Great service!  We had the milk braised pork shoulder, duck neck rillette, chicken skewers, chicken thigh kebabs, peanut butter cheesecake, and apple cider beer. Each was fantastic!  We went on a Thursday about 6:00 and had a 30 min wait but cocktails were available during the wait.  Actually we enjoyed the wait because it gave us the chance to ogle the dishes that others were having.",1
8205,Milk braised pork shoulder came recommended and didn’t disappoint. Busy but good service. The Sicilian Iris dessert was delicious. We were gaga over every dish that came out the kitchen. Must come back.,1
8206,"Wowza, this is some of the best meat I've ever had. It will sound strange, but everything tastes kinda like pot roast. From the super-soft texture, to some sort of seasoning they use. It's an odd description, but trust me, it's good. I feel like this is one of the places you have to go while visiting Chicago. It's a bit pricey, but totally worth it.",1
8207,"A little different vibe than the old location (which was just across the street), but the food is still amazing. Be ready to share so you can try as many dishes as possible. Also they have done a couple beer collaborations with Off Color Brewing, so look for those.",1
8208,"Food is great, but the place is insanely popular, crowded and loud. Having said that, eat there. Their signature braised pork with mashed potatoes and crispy bacon is amazing and worth a stop. Octopus was ok, slightly overcooked. The rather untraditional mix with green beans made it a delightful dish. Summary: if you are looking for good food, go there. But if you need a place for a nice lunch or dinner, this will not be your best choice.",1
8209,"Amazing ham-packed spot with a fun vibe and delicious, inventive menu. Stopped by for a quick bite on a Monday night and had the roasted beets with whipped goat cheese. I’ll be back to try more things shortly!",1
8210,Just love this place always amazing food great service yummy drinks!,1
8211,Everything was super tasty,1
8212,"Absolutely delicious. We are from Spain and we were in town for a dental conference. The food is out of this world! The quality the flavors that make your taste buds go crazy! We came 1 night sat at the bar and decided to come back for dinner the 2nd night! The staff is also delightful.

Keep it up!",1
8213,"We were visiting from Florida so we weren’t attracted to this place after reading  the google description of this restaurant, we avoided going to this place because we thought they just have small plates and it would be more like a charcuterie. One night it was too late to make a reservation in a upscale place so we decide to go to this restaurant just because it was close to our hotel and we were tired. It was packed, no too fancy atmosphere, we had to share a tall table so we weren’t that happy until the extra nice server came and recommend some plates and drinks, we accepted her recommendations and we were totally amazed with the food, we don’t love duck and we got it there and now is one of our favorite dishes of all time. The food, the presentation and the service are amazing. I totally recommend this place and we can’t wait to go back to Chicago just to go to the Purple Pig.",1
8214,"One of my most favorite spots. Good wines, great food. The charcuterie selections are outstanding. The relaxed atmosphere is heady. I know that sounds like an oxymoron but they have nailed upscale casual.",1
8215,Amazing meal! Slightly more expensive than I anticipated but I'm so glad I went.,1
8216,Over the top amazing food always!!!,1
8217,"Stopped in by chance for a late lunch and was surprised by the awesome dishes. Every thing was expertly prepared and delicious. Although not obvious, the food is served tapas style. Although broccoli is 15 USD, the quality is very good.",1
8218,"Great tasting food and very innovative. However the restaurant itself is incredibly noisy. Impossible to have a conversation with a table. The service is also extremely slow. Food takes so long to come out and by the time it does, I didn't really feel like it was worth the wait.",1
8219,"Good food in a great ambience. They don't take reservations so there's a bit of a wait but it is worth the time; sometimes there are tables available on the outside and a waiting list for the indoors, if you have the time, wait to be sitted inside, it's way better, cozy and cool. I recommend the smoked pork tongue, the pork belly and the roasted beets. Also, the crispy pig's ears.",1
8220,"Expect to wait a long time, but totally worth it! Great wine and food. I definitely recommend trying the cheese boards and having the waiter pair of the spreads with them. Dessert was fantastic as well. Highly recommend this place.",1
8221,Excellent customer service! Whenever I needed something they were there for me. Thank you guys,1
8222,Excellent food and service. The lady that waited on us gave us awesome recommendations as well. Loved the Orrichette pasta and my wife loved the beets. Arronchinis were great too.,1
8223,we were served by Tadhg and he was absolutely amazing!!! the food was great but Tadhg was simply amazing and made the experience amazing!!!!,1
8224,"The food here came in small portions, but it was SO good! It was great quality as well. The atmosphere was fun, we were able to sit outside even though it was really cold, because they had heaters. It was a classy place and the service was excellent. They even gave us one of the entree's for free because they brought it out late!",1
8225,Lots of good and interesting food. Good spot.,1
8226,Excellent food and drinks. Dishes are small so you can order a bunch to share. Very fun place. The staff is great. Very good beer selection. Heated porch is nice to sit in as well.. Really cool atmosphere.,1
8227,$$  Food is very good. Very busy but worth the wait. Outside dinning available with great views. Order food to share. Better on the wallet and best way to get the best experience. Drinks are well crafted. Sipping is suggested. Bar bill can get out of hand quickly. Only complaints; small bathrooms and sticky floors.,1
8228,"Wow!  Really lived up to the comments from my Chicago friends.  Went one Fall evening and enjoyed the (very tight) wait with an amazing cocktail.  We shared a table with others and were treated to an incredible array of small plates with meats, cheeses, veg, breads, and fantastic European wine list.  Cannot wait to return for the experience alone.",1
8229,"A very unique experience.  My husband and I tried this place out when we were in Chicago a month ago and were really pleased with everything we got.  Didn't feel rushed, good service, interesting menu.  The wine list was on point which we really appreciated.  Definitely happy we gave this one a try!",1
8230,"I finally had a chance to try this very popular venue.

It is good, very good. But based on these hype and how hard it can be to get in, I really was expecting to be wowed.

The service is 5+ stars. The waitstaff is helpful and informative. But the Ford was hit or miss. The hits were great. But the misses were very off. Almost like it wasn't seasoned right.

I'll be back to see if it was an off night.",1
8231,"Loved the food! Had some great conversations with some of our table-mates, but be aware that could be a downside as well. Also at our table was a drunk and obnoxious guy who the staff refused to deal with. He ruined what would have been an otherwise great dining experience.",1
8232,"I have never had a bad experience here. This is my go-to special occasion place, and I had the best pork of my life here (the milk braised shoulder). I’ve found that if you plan for an early dinner (get there around 4:30) you can greatly reduce your wait time.",1
8233,"A great mediterranean spot in the Chicago! The portions are huge, and there's a lot of options for everyone. They have your traditional dishes, and a wide array of newer spins on more classic dishes. Definitely get a mix of things, and try something you haven't before. They won't disappoint!",1
8234,Amazing food and easily the best waiter I have ever had. She knew details of every single item and recommended things for the table based off of diet restrictions. Totally worth the price.,1
8235,"I really wanted to love this place, especially after all the rave reviews I had heard about it; I had high expectations. We ordered a few dishes and the food overall was underwhelming, with either our dishes being much too sweet, or too salty. The cost per dish was a bit pricey and I had expected better for what we had paid. Our server was also a bit curt. Overall was a disappointing experience.",0
8236,"The entree was phenomenal, I got the Pork Belly and Tenderloin. The tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium and the pork belly was tender and the fat was well rendered with a nice sear. For dessert I had the Saffron Cheesecake which was absolutely to die for.",1
8237,"The Purple Pig is amazing!!! Used this as a Wedding Gift Dinner for a close friend (that way, I got a great meal out of their gift as well ;) ) They both texted me the next day and said they had a great time!

The space is a bit...crowded. Some of the seating is community table seating, with that once we started eating and had drinks it still felt private enough. My parents who are suburban through and through may have had a harder time with the close quarters/non private table. Though once they started eating I think they would have forgiven it!

They will recommend to you how many dishes to order, and after you place your order, your waiter/waitress will stagger them into a good order.  Everything is shared plates and comes out when ready. Alyssa, our waitress, was amazing! Very knowledgeable and helped us novices through the wine list.

Everything was amazing, for us the Stars:

Chicken Thigh Kebobs: Super moist!
Pork Shoulder: Just... perfect pig (not purple... they should work on that ;) )
Calamari (it's served cold and is a lighter salad-esque dish)
Whipped Feta with Date Crackers: These Data crackers were insanely delicious!

The ""probably won't order next time""
Brussels Sprouts - Still good, but the thyme and lemon flavors were a bit strong, though that's exactly what the menu said they'd taste like
Pigs Ear - it's cut into thin strips and deep fried. To me, it tasted like yummy deep fried strips, to my friend who had eaten pigs ears before it did not much resemble the taste to him.

We weren't disappointed with a single thing, and cannot wait to go back!",1
8238,"Believe the reviews. It really does have absolutely excellent food. Even though it's not cheap, there are several affordable options which means you can get a really satisfying meal without breaking the bank. I was a little skeptical when my friend recommended this since I usually don't like ""small plate"" style restaurants, but this place does it right and really is special.",1
8239,"Very good food
Reservation is preferred",1
8240,"Food is so delicious - we especially loved the winter salad and the chicken thigh kabobs. Ambiance is a bit hectic though. They told us it would be a 45 min wait so we almost left, but it ended up being less than a ten min wait. There is a heated patio waiting area where you can order food and drinks (standing only) in case you don’t want to wait for a table.",1
8241,"This restaurant was recommended to me on Twitter, of all places, and I’m so thankful the stars aligned to bring me here. One of the best meals I have had in the states. Highly recommend! The staff was amazing and the atmosphere was just as it should be. Don’t miss out on it when you’re in Chicago!",1
8242,So delicious. Workers are very nice. Good atmosphere.  Two thumbs up👍,1
8243,"Great atmosphere although you may feel a little squeezed among the amount of people!
Great drinks and beer selection, and the food is amazing!
I'd recommend this place for a friend's night out or happy hour with work friends.
You HAVE to try the pig ears and the octopus plates! Both AMAZING.
Location is also spot on. Close to public transportation and to all Chicago has to offer.",1
8244,"Tried something new today and loved it! I told our waiter Jake to give my wife and I his favorite appetizer( anchovy vinaigrette broccoli ), top two entrées( Lamb shoulder & Pork ribs ) and favorite desert( Sicilian Iris). He definitely came through! All were delicious and worth the 2hr wait. Nice thing about the wait is you can keep yourself busy elsewhere because they will call you via cell phone when your table is ready. Prices were fair with all of the above ordered plus an extra order of broccoli, our total was $57.98 before the tip. Not to mention the impeccable service...We will definitely be back again.",1
8245,"The food was delicious. Unfortunately our server was a complete snob. When it became apparent my girlfriends and I weren't going to order drinks (for lunch!) our server completely lost interest in our table. He didn't once check on us after we got our food, and refused to split the check amongst us. It was clear from his behavior that we were unwelcome. It's a shame because the food was excellent.",1
8246,"Tonight I deeply desired a splurge but once I physically entered the purple pig tonight at 6pm I was told by the hostess that the restaurant was completely filled up and there would be a 45 minute wait if I wanted a table or I could look for a seat at the bar.  She told me I was welcome to have a look and I did find just one tall seat at the bar and literally SQUEEZED myself between two men enjoying their tapas.  I decided against ordering a cheese plate because they charge $10 for one cheese and $25 for 3 pieces.  I guess I was in sticker shock once I perused their listed menu items ranging in price from $15 to $25 per tapas. Unlike other tapas restaurants I was not offered bread as part of my meal and the tapas here are generously sized so if you visit here solo like I did you may not need more than one tapas because the majority of these tapas are large enough to share. I was very disappointed because the whole fun of ordering tapas is to try and enjoy and experiment with a small tasting of several tiny dishes. Here it's so cost prohibitive you may well end up spending close to $40 or more then need to take leftovers with you. One young professional woman sitting next to me ordered a broccoli tapas but she left it completely unfinished and wouldn't take it with her. I'd also like to add that she was forced into talking to two different men who sat next to her at different times and they wouldn't let her enjoy her meal in peace! I ordered the calamari salad which was salty and cold. I thought it was definitely tasty but I was so surprised that it was a cold tapas dish. I had had hopes that the calamari itself would have been grilled and warm but it was a cold salad instead.  I took notice that another woman near me ordered one charcuterie as a snack and it seemed like an awfully tiny portion so I was surprised that she had paid $17 for it. I paid $17 for the calamari then decided to have a dessert so I chose the raspberry tart for $11 which was extremely delicious and presented beautifully.  The dessert was sour and tart and a tiny serving of ice cream came with it. I am giving this restaurant 3 stars because it's very noisy and reminds me of a loud food hall. The seating here is very tight so even though this is a large restaurant it's so cramped full of tables stacked so close together it doesn't have a relaxing enough vibe to just sit down,  take your time and relax.  When I had a chat with the other people near me I had a difficult time hearing what they had to say. This restaurant experience seems to be more for a hip and in crowd-- a place to impress business colleagues but not a charming or romantic ambiance to bring a good friend or a date.   If I owned a tapas restaurant I'd make the dishes here tinier and much more affordable.  I even noticed they had a special charcuterie board priced at $50. I'm sure if you love fancy cocktails priced at $15 a glass and all your tapas to be around $17 a plate then you may wish to give the purple pig a chance.  I must be honest and include the fact that my tapas was so over salty that I was extremely thirsty afterwards and had to consume 2 bottles of water almost 30 minutes later because I was so dehydrated.  I am not a fan of salty dishes and overpriced tapas.  My dessert was excellent and I thought the calamari could have tasted a bit better had it been served warm and not cold.  I suggest this restaurant separate cold tapas from hot tapas so people know in advance what to expect.  The Purple pig is not within my normal day price range so I'm in no hurry to repeat this experience because I'm not into dining at the bar then spending $40 including tip for one tapas and one dessert.  I wasn't offered bread here so I'm assuming bread isn't a typical item they offer their guests and since I'm a bread addict I was disappointed.  I just don't understand the concept of oversized tapas at a huge price point. I just didn't get good vibes from this place but I'm a laid back person who loves quiet and a European atmosphere so this restaurant is a bit too chaotic for my needs.",1
8247,"Really enjoyed a brief dinner here. Would definitely recommend it for a casual friends night out. The food was well prepared, plenty of choices (think Otollenghi Chicago style) and mostly well done. Very loud and very busy. While the servers were good I'm not a fan of multiple servers at the table tho.

And Chicago, what is with all the pig duck and goat themed restaurants?!!",1
8248,"While the food was excellent, it is very expensive.  For example 1 deviled egg is 8 dollars and 3 scallops are somewhere around 22. There is a lot going on in this restaurant very busy so very noisy. They have a nice outdoor area that is heated.  Definitely not family oriented. Service was friendly.",1
8249,"One of the best food experiences I have had in Chicago. The menu was incredible. Had the gnocchi,  the lamb and the Greek sausage.  They were all toe curlers.  Great staff, good cocktails.",1
8250,"Duck is amazing
Broccoli is too salty",1
8251,"The purple pig is extremely busy, but very well staffed. The food however, was not what I was expecting for a Michelin recommended restaurant. I enjoyed two of the six dishes, but I have to admit, it is very filling, and the price point isn't bad either.",1
8252,"I was super excited to visit this restaurant after seeing all of the great reviews.

I got the whipped feta cheese appetizer.  It tasted sour.

The service was great so I didn’t give it just one star.

Perhaps, I needed to explore more items on the menu.",0
8253,"The portions were tiny! My friend and I are both small people and we got an appetizer and two entrees and left hungry! 3 meatballs is not a meal. The food was over seasoned and the restaurant was cold. I have no idea why the ratings were so high for this restaurant. $46 for a tiny piece of salmon, 3 meatballs, and a small bowl of over-salted vinegary beets. Not worth it.",0
8254,Still one of the best in Chicago. The beets and that pistachio cream 🤤 are worth the stop alone. The cheesecake is also very good and slightly different,1
8255,"In spite of a 2.5 hour wait, the food was well worth the wait.  Wine list was excellent, the entrées were very creative,  though a bit too salty on all but one of the 8 items we had.  Still, the preparations worked and were really well prepared.",1
8256,"Amazing food. Very different than our normal cuisine, but I just asked for some reccomendations and they did right by me. My husband and I shared four dishes. The cornbread was my favorite. We went late afternoon after lunch and before dinner and there was no wait.",1
8257,"Wow, this place is literally a trick! On Friday evening, his friend came and said that the waiting time is 45 minutes. We just went to the next bar to drink a cup. The food was unbelievable! We have a lot of dishes and beer. We really like the ear of crisp pork and egg and cabbage (good!!!) and there is a potato porridge. We also bought some Italian sausage, with lavash and pickled vegetables, pork, mashed potatoes and gravy (meat is very soft and tasty, broccoli is very acid. In short, the ratio of food and try a good new tasty place!",1
8258,Stopped in for some drinks before dinner elsewhere and the smells and appearance of passing dishes tempted us to stay for a meal. Staff was efficient and friendly. Next time we're in the area we will be eating here.,1
8259,"Small portions, a bit pricey but definitely worth it. Nice views and outdoor seating available. Can get crowded outside because everyone wants see the view while dining. Definitely would recommend and will definitely go again when I'm in Chi-town.",1
8260,"We waited close to two hours to get seated and I really was not blown away. After waiting so long to get seated, you would expect that the food would knock your socks off. Unfortunately, 2 out of the 5 dishes were phenomenal, and the others were just ok. The wait staff was great and the food came out relatively quickly. Cool and lively atmosphere but since i'm only in town for a short period, I don't think i'll make it a priority anytime soon to come back.",1
8261,"Service was a bit diffident (our waiter did not know the wine list, and the hostesses seemed to enjoy making people wait longer than necessary) but the food was amazing.  Not for vegetarians (even the vegetables are cooked in animal fat--something a sourpuss vegetarian across from us apparently didn't research ahead of time) but a great mix of wine, cheese, meats, and small-ish plates with a Mediterranean bent.  We especially loved the beets and turkey, but you really can't go wrong.",1
8262,"Awesome tapas style restaurant! We ordered the spare ribs, meatballs, stuffed quid and club sandwich between 3 of us - all of the dishes were great but the ribs were the real standout! The only slight negative is that it’s a little on the expensive side.",1
8263,Great food. Especially liked the stuffed squid. Long wait.,1
8264,Delicious and unique eating experience!  They recommend ordering 1.5 plates per person so we ordered 6 dishes for 4 people and each one was fantastic. A little expensive but worthwhile for the quality and experience.,1
8265,"Absolutely great experience. Food is outstanding, perfectly cooked! We went with 7 kids, they provided crayons and paper cups even know that actually they don’t carry those but were friendly to get it to the kids. Great place, great service, definitely recommend! Congrats!!!",1
8266,Truly a magical experience. My husband and I chose The Purple Pig by chance for our anniversary dinner. We are most definitely not people that frequent restaurants of this caliber. We were simply blown away. It was such a comfortable welcoming environment and there are simply no words for how incredible the food was. I understand what it means to get emotional over food now. We were so sad when our meal was over. This might have just become our anniversary tradition.,1
8267,"My GF was telling me to visit that place and then we did it. It was crowded, of course, and the host told us to wait 2 hours for a table. Immediately we turn around heading out, but suddenly she told us to wait, that she had a table for two.. We got confused but we've decided to wait and we got a table. I was wondering if it would worth to wait 2 h after I had my dinner, and the answer is yes! It would. That was one of the most extraordinary food I've ever had. service was okay, music really loud (maybe trying to bring up some young atmosphere) it was hard to relax, but was a really good food.",1
8268,"Fantastic food (don't miss the beets!). May have been the best meal I had all year (omg that salt-cured tuna). Loved sitting at the bar and watching the (very talented) kitchen staff at work, and the bartender made every cocktail I asked for (off menu). Just sit as far as you can from the door in the winter time!",1
8269,"Long wait, good wine, good food; can't wait? Don't go! I have always wanted to check out this place since I've been in Chicago, and finally after 6 years I made my way here with a few other people. The wait was an hour long but the host and servers kept us in the loop with updated wait times, complimentary popcorn, and served us drinks while we waited. The menu is filled with a little bit of everything for everyone's palate. Food portion, quality, and customer service was top notch. I'd definitely recommend this place for dates (for patient couples).",1
8270,This place was recommended to us by a friend and it exceeded my expectations. The food was outstanding. One of my top 10 best ever. I had an amazing glass of wine too. The staff was very friendly too. Highly recommend.,1
8271,"Fun place with very interesting flavor combinations. The menu is all over the place with Greek, Italian, French and Spanish influences. Our server was Jan and even though it was ""her first day"" she made amazing suggestions (both food and wine) and was very personable. Great experience!",1
8272,"Delicious food, unique blends of taste.  The milk-braised pork shoulder was fantastic.  The waitress seemed inattentive to our table even though the place was not terribly busy. Otherwise, had a wonderful evening.",1
8273,"Extremely good restaurant.
I landed here because Zagat recommended it.
The service was excellent.
We had to eat in the bar because there was a long waiting list.
The food was delicious, it was different, high quality, definitely worth it.
If you go to Chicago, I’d recommend going to the Purple Pig.",1
8274,"Food was ok.  Service was great.  You pick small plates of food that may not go together, but are are very good individually.  Some plates tasted premade others tasted fresh.  Overall I enjoyed eating there.  It's worth a shot",1
8275,The Purple Pig serves food with a magnifican and an original combination of flavors. My daughter took us today and we enjoyed it a lot. The Pork belly has an original combination of flavors. The octopus in salsa verde was delicious and the turkey leg was outstanding. They have a variety of excellent wines. We will come again in our next visit to Chicago.,1
8276,"Love it!!!!! Great service and food.
A little crowdy",1
8277,A little heavy on the sweet to balance out the umami in their big plates. That said the pig's ears w/ over easy egg & the duck confit w/ smoked trout roe & Greek yogurt were delicious. Staff excellent at wine pairings and the shared table dining experience was was friendly and gave a pleasantly gregarious atmosphere. Will go again & highly recommend.,1
8278,"Came from  S. Florida and purple pig was ""on the list"". It definitely did not disappoint.
Great food and outstanding service.
Would recommend the pig ears and also the pork belly,  but so many delicious items.
Highly recommend",1
8279,"We recently visited this restaurant with a party of 12. I personally tried 6 different entrees each running 16-22 dollars a piece. The portions are extremely small and the flavor is minimal. The server was not accommodating to our questions and the service was slow. When we reminded our waiter that he had not taken the order of 2 in our party there was no apology, he actually appeared irritated. This place is over rated, crowded, loud and uncomfortable. We don't plan to go back.",0
8280,"This place has quickly become one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat. The staff is tremendously friendly and helpfully. The efficiency of the place is in itself a masterpiece. The salt-roasted beets are some of the best I've every had, and the butternut squash is absolutely delicious.",1
8281,"Oh I've missed you Purple Pig! Although this place is obviously popular for its pork- the seafood is amazing as well (except the squid ink ravioli- it's one of the nastiest things I've ate). The service was alright- seem like she was a little annoyed. The restaurant itself is either too loud inside or too hot outside. No reservations, so there'll probably be like a 20-30 min wait, but there's so much to do in that area aka shopping!

Octopus ($22)-4.5/5 One of my absolute favorite dishes to get here! The octopus is cooked nicely -crispy outside and tender inside. The sauce was delicious as well and paired nicely!

Squid Ink Ravioli ($20)-1/5 No No No!! This is honestly one of the worst dishes I've had in a while. Corn and snow crab- didn't sound too bad huh? Rarely any snow crab and lots of corn (I kinda hate corn in soupy texture though). The Ravioli is just filled with corn flavor like soup. And they only give you 3 ravioli (thank god, cause it actually tastes really bad).

Branzino ($18)-4/5 I love me some fish, but this was CHARRED, to the point that you could taste it. It was a little bitter, but so great for summer because the broth was cool and super tasty and the fish was hot.",1
8282,"Although lacking in indoor seating during prime meal times, the food was seasoned very and had a diverse range of ingredients that came together in unexpected ways. It is well worth bringing adventurous eaters, you won't be disappointed.",1
8283,"This one's my favorite American restaurant now. It was my first time to visit this place and I can honestly say that they've got what it takes to become a very successful restaurant. We've ordered lots of food and my favorite one is the caviar with ice cream, even the taste of their ice cream is totally different from a very nice way but I absolutely love everything we've ordered.",1
8284,"Simply: if you haven't been here, you're missing an amazing culinary experience. No reservations, so get here at opening, or mid-late afternoon. Only criticism is wine list is a little thin on moderately priced cabs.",1
8285,"I went about a week ago to finally visit the Purple Pig. I had the following:

1) Shrimp and Potato Gnocchi covered in shrimp bisque. This was a special item not on the menu, so I'm a little fuzzy on the details. I felt hesitant about getting it since it'll be a while before I could have it again, but I am so glad I did. This was easily my favorite dish of the night. The shrimp bisque the covered the food was so perfectly seasoned and the shrimp was nice and tender. I enjoyed the softness of the potato gnocchi as well. If I had to improve this dish, I wish it had a little more shrimp. I get that it's supposed to be a small plate, but it had 3 pieces of shrimp on it. I was eating alone and thought about how little that would be if I shared it with another person.

2) Pig Ears. Looking through the reviews, I see that this is favorite of many and unfortunately, I didn't like this dish. The kale, the pickled cherry peppers, and the egg give the dish a tart, but great flavor. However, the pig ears were just too hard for me and it affected my ability to enjoy the dish. I will say that this dish can easily be shared since you get plenty.

3) Gelato/sorbet. I specifically had the roasted white chocolate, banana, and coconut sorbet. The gelato itself is quite smooth and very flavorful. Coconut was my favorite flavor out of the 3. It had just the right amount of coconut flavor in it. Not too subtle, not too strong. Banana was pretty good as well, but it didn't capture my heart like coconut did. Roasted white chocolate was delicious and I would order it again, but for a white chocolate flavor, I found it to be a little rich. It might as well have been regular chocolate ice cream.

To finish, I really enjoyed my visit here and I would come again. The customer service was top notch, even though it was pretty busy when I went. I didn't wait more than 5-10 minutes for each dish to come out. Anything I needed I had in seconds or the waiter had it on him already. As for the restaurant itself, I have to say that it's rather cramped inside and I felt like it was difficult to move around without bumping into someone. Thankfully, I hear that the restaurant is moving to a new location, so hopefully that'll be solved! I definitely recommend trying it out, but have some patience.",1
8286,"If you are in Chicago and love to explore your food adventures, this is a must go place.",1
8287,"Loved their ginger glazed pork belly, very juicy and tender. The jelly along with their cheese platter is also delicious. Highly recommended.",1
8288,Absolutely loved it!,1
8289,"I absolutely love this place! We visit about once a year and its always an amazing experience. Food, staff, drinks and atmosphere are top notch highly recommend!",1
8290,"Good food but for a vegetarian it was difficult to find something to eat. But, the beat salad was worth a trip back alone. Give it a try, especially if you are a carnivore or daring and want to dry roasted bone marrow or pig ears.",1
8291,"The purple pig on Chicago's magnificent mile is such a treat! I have heard about, but never had, Tapas. Oh my goodness! They were so good at this restaurant. The food was so good. I have no idea still why it is called the purple pig, but it was such a treat to go there while in Chicago visiting family. Right on Michigan Avenue and very easy access sits the restaurant the Purple pig. they have a wonderful bone broth that will make you feel wonderful and fantastic service. I have heard this restaurant is talked about being Vegetarian, but I don't think that is the case. Dont let that stop you from trying this wonderful restaurant though! This restaurant was names one of the best restaurants in Chicago in 2010. It was relatively inexpensive and a lot of fun to eat here!",1
8292,"Food is incredible. Service, hip unfriendly. I know they always have a wait, are slammed and that don't have to care, but wouldn't it be more enjoyable for everyone if you found even micro moments to connect with customers?  In full disclosure, I don't love cramped,  loud places, and I deal with them when the food is this good, unless servers are rude. Outdoor cocktail server and bussers very nice, not the case with bar and wait staff inside.",0
8293,"This is a fun spot with a LOT of unique dishes. Come here only if you are willing to experiment. I like trying different foods, but even I needed clarifications on what a number of menu items meant. It's all good food, though. And the plates are easily shareable, so if you're looking for a fun date night, this place could be it.",1
8294,"Great location.  Too bad they don't take reservations, so get there early.  Great twists on common and uncommon pork cuts. Nice selection of wine.  They even have outdoor seating with heat lamps in the fall.  Shop Michigan Avenue and then eat!",1
8295,"Visited this wonderful restaurant with my family of 4 & really enjoyed the creative flavours! Our favourites were the potato ice cream & caviar, burrata cannoli. and mushroom shawarma as we had never tasted anything quite like those. Definitely allocate enough time to wait for a table as it is well worth it. Compliments to their system where they send you a text message when your name on the wait-list is coming up. That way, you can roam around the neighbourhood to pass the time.",1
8296,Fantastic food and atmosphere!,1
8297,Popped in to escape the shopping on miracle mile. Was pleasantly surprised. An unassuming locale with very yummy food. The beet salad was amazing. Cauliflower was decent. Corn polenta is a must in my opinion. Croque madame was also good. Planned all of the meals on my Chicago trip except this one and I lucked into my favorite meal of the weekend.,1
8298,"Honestly, I was expecting a lot better. I felt very underwhelmed. I got all the items that people recommended based on Yelp reviews and the waiter's recommendations. I got the pig ears, bone marrow (too fatty), and fried brussel sprouts. The food was more greasy and heavy, which I feel took away from the quality. Also, it was a 2.5 hour wait, which kind of worked out because we were just able to eat first dinner at another restaurant closeby. Overall, I would not return here.",1
8299,"I finally got to @thepigchicago and boy does it live up to the hype! We had cocktails while we waited for a spot on the patio to open up. We had great service and got to know the couples at the tables beside us (and ask all about what they ordered). Our favorites were the beets with pistachio butter (do not miss this!), polenta, and marshmallow fluff-peanut butter mille feuille. The pics didn't turn out great, but it was worth it to eat on the patio in perfect weather. Can't recommend highly enough",1
8300,Great place to go with a group. Lots of fun tapas style dishes. Good food good wine cool atmosphere.  Beware it can get very loud and crowded.  I wouldn't go here for an intimate meal.,1
8301,"March 2016:  Flavors are awesome. The people take such great care of you. The care for matching the wine to the food is above average.
March 2017:  Back in town again and made sure to dine here again.  Fantastic flavors, wines, service, and energy.  Foodies love this place.",1
8302,"Some of the best food I have ever had. Lamb ribs and half duck were out of this world. Service wasn't the best, cheesecake dessert was ""okay"" and more than 1 hour waiting, but the food was amazing and made up for everything",1
8303,"Always creative and tasty! Tip: the servers always try to get you to order multiple dishes, but one is usually a plenty large portion for a single person. I recommend ordering as many dishes as you have people then sharing all of them.",1
8304,"Celebrated our 10th anniversary. Ordered way too much food, but it was so delicious. Go at an off time (think early dinner or late lunch) to avoid lines as the wait can be several hours long. We 'only' had to wait about a half hour when we went at about 2PM on a Friday, but totally worth it.",1
8305,"Food was great (a little pricey, but all delicous), wine was excellent.  With a list like they have we had no clue where to start.  We simply told our server what we liked, and she brought us the perfect wines, and then gave us a card with the names on it.  All in all, worth the wait and price.",1
8306,"I must say, my friend and I expected to be turned away or at least told to wait for 30 min to an hour, but miraculously we were shown to a table immediately (on a Friday night!). The waitress was bubbly and happy and tattooed - a rare combo, plus very knowledgable about wine. She suggested a nice red for under $40 and we enjoyed her choice tremendously. We also got the Charcuterie plate, mussels, olives, and the skate. All were amazing, except the skate, which tasted like a cheap fried fish.

Overall, I loved the place, even though it was loud and packed (My and my neighbor's elbows were almost touching). I'll definitely be back!",1
8307,"Surprisingly got in on a Thursday evening with no wait. Although the flavors were not as bold as the waiter described, most dishes were good. The Greek cornbread, roasted beets, and ham panini were the standouts. The menu is a bit overwhelming with small fonts and tightly spaced entries. Also tried the slider based on other reviews but it was average in flavor and consistency.",1
8308,"Stopped in for post-work dinner with colleagues, loved the food, wine and received excellent service. Favorite dishes shared included Secreto, Berkshire Shoulder, the Turkey leg, and the grilled cauliflower. The bone marrow was unbelievably tasty too!",1
8309,"fun spot I randomly walked into with my ex-fiance. We're divorced now, but enjoyed the food",1
8310,We stop here every time we are in town. The food is great. Since we are a party of two we have been lucky to not have a long wait. We usually snag seats at the bar. Anything involving brussels sprouts is a must for us. Oh and the rosemary almonds in duck fat are always ordered. We usually share the small plates. We have never made it to the bigger entree type items. Much more fun to share.,1
8311,"Went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Was told the wait was about an hour (as expected) so we went across the way to Corner Cafe for coffee. It was cold so we didn't want to be out long. About 20 minutes we got the text saying pur table was available (bonus!) We were placed at a table in the covered outdoor seating and was plenty warm. We ordered the beef salad and the ceprese salad for appetizers and they were amazing. For our entrees we ordered spare ribs, a steak, and on of their ham sandwiches. All portions are big and can be shared easily, even the sandwhich. The food is cooked to perfection and all seasonings are well in tune with each other. We will definitely come again. The restaurant is on the smaller side and I wouldn't bring a large group here. Seating is family style, so sometimes you're joining a table of 10 and spots are limited.Not only would the seating possibly be an issue, but with no resrvations available and the restaurant very popular, the wait might be extra long if you didn't plan on it.",1
8312,"Delicious food in a great atmosphere. Everything I had was delicious; braised beets with whipped goats cheese and pistachio vinaigrette, fried pig ear with crispy Kale and fried egg, braised octopus with green beans and fingerling potatoes, and the lemon panacotta (which I did not need but really enjoyed). There was a good choice of beer and wine and the place was buzzing on a Friday night. Well worth a return visit!",1
8313,"The food is delicious and he staff are incredibly nice. My group has limited knowledge of wine, but the waiter was incredibly helpful in giving recommendations in a kind way. Food is amazing; definitely try to leave room for dessert!",1
8314,"An eclectic offering of food with a crazy shared table atmosphere. Fun place to go with a group, but not for a romantic dinner. Food was excellent. Its a very busy place, with limited seating and no real waiting area so plan ahead.",1
8315,Really good food,1
8316,"As a vegetarian, my choices were limited but every dish I ordered was exquisite. I got the baked Parmesan crembrule which was creative and yummy.
My husband had the coppa steak and in his words 'it was perfectly done to silky smooth texture and it melted in your mouth at the first bite'.
Though we were not in a mood for it, we were tempted by their extensive wine and cheese selections.
On coldish Chicago fall day, purple pig was a warm and charming place for dinner with friendly service.",1
8317,"Stopped here before a concert in December and really enjoyed the dishes we ordered, love that they came out when ready. We sat at the bar after a brief wait in the heated outside area. Hostess was super nice and bartender and server were friendly.",1
8318,"while waiting to pick up friends, I stopped by and gave the purple pig a try. it is a small space but with high energy. I sat in the bar and ordered three items. food came out rather quickly.  The roasted beets tasted ok and somewhat sour. Beef marrow was somewhat fatty,  but offset by yummy toasts. services were great. I like this spontaneous place.",1
8319,The food here was great. Very creative dishes and great executuion. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired. Its very loud and a bit crowded. Moving between tables to get to the bathroom was challenging. But the food makes it worth a visit.,1
8320,"This was a super niche and eclectic dining experience! As most have suggested, walk in and put in your name, then either find a place at the bar, find another bar to hang out for a bit, or enjoy the shopping around you! They will text you and give you an opportunity to reply to the text to let them know you're walking back over.

We ordered the beets (delicious and different), the  gnocchi (OMG YUM!) and the pork belly & tenderloin (drooling just remembering the dish). The meat option was our absolute favorite and the beets were our least favorite, but still yummy. Would probably try something else next time we're in Chicago.

Would definitely take an Uber (or something similar) to get to the restaurant and anything else on Michigan Ave. If you're staying 5 miles or less outside the city like we did (Air BnB), you're drive will cost less than $20 one way, maybe $25 if during rush hour (5:00 - 7:00 pm) during the week.",1
8321,"Really interesting and unique cuisine. Great place for a bite to eat. Don’t expect your normal meal, you will find abnormal items on the menu that are really good!",1
8322,"This place is a gem on the Magnificent Mile. I've come here twice (separated by 8 years), and was blown away by the quality of food and service on both occasions.

This is a super popular place, expect a wait of 1-2 hours easily, as people usually stay here a while. Its a small plates and drinks kind of place, and if the weather is bad outside (like it was when I went) people won't be any hurry to leave!

We started with the bobota greek cornbread (loved the honey and cheese on top of the bread), and the 3 cheese selection (Manchego, La Retorta & Brigante). We also got a bottle of MACEDONIA, Kamara Estate, Assyrtiko from Thessaloniki, Greece which was fabulous, it was an orange wine!!

For the next round of food we got the Octopus a la plancha, some of the most tender Octopus I've had ever! Next we had the deviled eggs - fantastic again. And we had also ordered the Chicken thigh kebabs which were some of the juiciest kebabs I've had in the US! Our order of the kebabs was delayed a bit so they gave us a complementary fried Manchego cheese which hit the spot as well.

Overall, don't miss dining here if you're ever in Chicago. And you can't go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu, so order away!",1
8323,"It’s no secret that their food is absolutely incredible - I would never think to combine half the things on their menu (broccoli ice cream?!), but they pull it off in the most delicious of ways.  My only complaint the several times I have been there is that I am a human person, not a sardine!  Communal seating is one thing but being packed so tightly that a stranger sitting down next to you practically has to crawl into your lap while you hold their shopping bag is another thing entirely.",1
8324,"Fabulous, unpretentious food in a rustic European kitchen setting. Everything on the menu is good if not great and I really enjoy the meatball sliders and beet salad. The restaurant becomes extremely loud during peak times and you may have to share a communal table so this place probably isn't first date material. If you have to eat on Michigan Ave, this is the place!",1
8325,"Such a great place, but definitely on the pricier side.  Best way to describe this place is tapas style but not tapas portions aka bigger SO If you want to sample a good amount of food go with a larger group. Drinks are also bomb.",1
8326,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago! My fav menu item is the pork roasted almonds. The menu is seasonal so it changes throughout the year which is nice as you can always try something new. The smears are a great value since they're filling and a great price. Only downside is they don't take reservations. However you can put your phone number down & walk around to grab a drink or explore, they'll text/call when a spot is ready.",1
8327,The portions too small for the price but food is very good,1
8328,The food was amazing!  Like eating artwork on your plate.  The pork belly was the literal hero of the evening!  For my first taste of Chicago it could not have started off any better!,1
8329,"Very good food and cocktails, and a long wine list. Overall an enjoyable experience. On the downside, it's a tiny space that fills up quick, and they don't take reservations. If you go during peak times, you can expect to wait over an hour for a table.",1
8330,"The wine sugessted by the bartender was very good. Food is tasty but it took very long time to get the small piece of steak medium cooked and delivered to my table. The person next to me had finished his two dishes while I was waiting for my food, and he arrived and ordered later than I did. Also, the room can use some acoustical treaments, it is very noisy, difficult for conversation.",1
8331,"One of the best eating out experiences till date. We had Whipped Feta with Date Crackers, Saffron Pickled Leeks and Snow Peas, Grilled Broccoli with Anchovy Vinaigrette, Roasted Garlic and Toasted Breadcrumbs, Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Crispy Lentils, Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes and Tzatziki, Octopus A La Plancha with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes and Salsa Verde, 5 selection cheese platter and some cocktails.... The food was exquisite... melt in your mouths meat... everything tasted divine... aptly spiced n presented... the flavors exploded in your palate... I give a double thumbs up to this restaurant which is temple of culinary arts. Take a bow chef n team.",1
8332,I would definitely come back. Good quality and taste. Small amount. 2 peopel will need to order 3 or 4 dishes.,1
8333,"The food was great. We got the corn risotto, calamari (AMAZING), chicken thigh kebab (super tender), and chicken drum sticks (this was meh). Overall, really enjoyed the food. Disappointed by the dessert though and therefore the 4 stars. We got the black chocolate cake with chocolate sherbert and passion fruit flavored sauce. The cake had a weird texture and didn't taste that great. The passion fruit sauce on the plate was delightful but kind of wish there was more of that on the plate + with the cake. Overall, service was ok, appetizers and entrees were amazing, dessert wasn't great.",1
8334,Fantastic food and service.,1
8335,"I have yet to eat at a better small plates restaurant in Chicago. The calamari salad and bone marrow were my favorite dishes, although the desserts were just as amazing. The service was excellent at first but it did take quite a while to pay and get out of there after we had eaten. Great Saturday night spot to eat at with friends",1
8336,"Loud atmosphere and mostly shared tables. The food was fantastic (small portions - great to share), the waitstaff was very knowledgeable and there are things on the menu most people would never think of eating! Fun place!",1
8337,"Located in an unassuming place, which makes it evident that it's the quality of the food (and amazing and friendly service) that draws in the eager clientele. Sharing style (and even communal with huge shared tables) is heartwarming. Come with a warm and inclusive attitude, an open mind and palette. You will not leave disappointed. Had the bone marrow, octopus, fennel three ways, beets with goat cheese, duck prosciutto, jamon, pork and bacon pate and of course, the short ribs. Chasing it all down with their recommended wines and some bourbon. A good night in Chicago.",1
8338,"Despite the name, this place is also a good choice for vegetarians. We had six courses, and aside from a little bacon in one of them, there was no pig or other meat involved. The highlights were the peas (because of the fresh mint mixed in) and the leeks.

There is a great selection of both pasteurized and raw milk cheeses, which made a wonderful dessert plate for two.

For me, though, the reason to go is the remarkable wine list, with hundreds of selections, all from countries bordering the Mediterranean. Nearly every selection is available by the glass, demi, half or full bottle, and they’ll even open a bottle of any of the wines priced under $50 (which is nearly all of them) and pour you just half. So it’s a great place to explore varieties and appellations you’ve never heard of.

One word of warning: the atmosphere is vibrant (read that as LOUD) to say the least, so it’s not a place for intimate conversation. It’s somewhat better on the patio, but even there it’s pretty boisterous.",1
8339,Best meal I've had in a while.  Portions were a bit on the small side even for a nice spot but it was so good that I just ordered more plates.  The service was outstanding and although a little small the atmosphere was excellent.  Can't wait to go back,1
8340,"Loved it though it was too noisy. That aside, great food and extensive wine list.",1
8341,"I didn't have a dish that disappointed. Like all of the other reviews explain, the wait time is long but what do you expect when the food is amazing? If you don't feel like waiting, go to Michael Jordan's steakhouse across the street and grab a drink and app so calm your appetite.",1
8342,"+ nice patio to have drinks with friends, + delicious small plates to share, + good European wine selection, - long wait time

Since it isn’t that easy to find a nice hang-out on Magnificent Mile, which is not a rooftop bar and where you can sit outside without being blared by music I was happy to find ‘The Purple Pig’.

I have to admit that it is hard to get a table without a longer wait time but the wait is worth it. The menu offers decent European wines; most of them for less than $40 a bottle and tasty tapas/small plates you can share with your companions. But the most important thing is that you can spend hours talking and have an enjoyable evening with friends without being interrupted by noise.

If you cannot decide on the menu try the milk braised pork with mashed potatoes, the spreads, and the artichoke, potatoes and asiago cheese appetizer.

The restaurant’s inside also looked promising but I guess it will be noisy.

Average price for a plate: $10
Average price for a bottle of wine: $35",1
8343,"Fantastic restaurant for shared dishes. Yes it's loud and crowded, but it fitts with the fast paced refined small dish great drinks menu.
Loved the burrata cannolis and the greek porc kabob.",1
8344,"A nice place for a slightly expensive night out, but that's expected for a good wine place with some great pairings. The people are friendly and the food is all really great (at least what I've tried). Don't be afraid to order appetizers and some wine that pairs well with them as a way to get your meal in. There's usually a wait, so be prepared to wait outside, but know that you can order a glass of wine while you wait!",1
8345,My wife and I had our first dinner as a married couple here. Our waiter recommended a delicious white Greek wine and we shared 3 or 4 small plates. A great local place in amongst some of the downtown chains. Highly recommended for couples!,1
8346,"I have to say that their menus were very unique, and most of them were tasty. However, we got the worst seat (right in front of the restroom and cash register) and the receptionist did not bother to ask us if we were okay with the seats which made the whole experience terrible. Also, the waiter who served us water spilled water onto our food. Overall, good food but horrible service.",1
8347,"Great food and a show if you snag one of the prime kitchenfront counter seats. Been here often. Grilled sardine appetizer and bucatini with guanciale cacio e pepe style, tasty and filling. Took home their Brussels sprouts and charred cauliflower. Newer digs does open up the space for movement between tables, but still warm and inviting. Disappointed they didn't have sweetbreads. They need to update their online menus to sync with daily.",1
8348,"Amazing!  My Chicago friend raved that it was his absolute favorite restaurant in the city, and we were not disappointed.

I believe we ate about 2/3 of the menu, and there wasn't a dish we didn't like.

Good wine selection as well.",1
8349,"Phenomenal. I would tell you about the specific food I had, but the menu has probably changed already, because the executive chef is a crazy creative genius who has new ideas all the time. Just don't expect it to be cheap or easy to get in, but that's the price we pay for greatness.",1
8350,"Food was TOO salty. Most on the menu actually. We ordered like 6-7 different plates. All the same.
Only less salty one and kinda good was ""salty beet salad"". No joke, that's the name!",0
8351,Get a seat at the bar and watch the chefs!!!  So cool!,1
8352,"Food was incredible, although that was mostly from the amount of fat in each dish.  Since they don't do reservations and they are completely off on expected wait times, it's impossible to plan a dinner for more than two people at best.  The service was rushed and rude.  The busboy literally pushed us over to get plates instead of saying excuse me.  The place is crowded and too loud to allow a conversation. Would never go back.  For the price, try Eddie v's or zed 451 for a much better experience.",0
8353,"Good lord the food was amazing! We put out names down for 5 on Saturday night, the wait was 2.5 hours. It was well worth it. We ended up grabbing drinks near by, and then walked over when our table was ready. We started with the asparagus rissoto, the tendon chicaronnes, and whipped feta. They were all great, I especially enjoyed the feta and asparagus. For mains, to share, we ordered the pork belly, duck confit, bavette steak, and ribs. The bavette steak was my favorite, they serve it quite rare. The meat was incredibly tender and oh so flavorful. The pork belly was great, it was in a delicious sauce. The duck confit was good as well. When I come again I will be skipping the ribs, and getting another order of the bavette!",1
8354,"While the food was amazing, the place seems to be run by college kids that think they're at a party. I waited 28 minutes for a squash appetizer, asked twice about it. The atmosphere is fun, but they need to step up the service to be in line with the wonderful food and wine list.",0
8355,"The place is busy, but well organized and their food is tasty! Sadly I did not take any photos of the items we ordered. Great drinks, coffee and desserts. Worth the wait!",1
8356,"What an amazing dining experience!!!  Sat at the bar and watched the chef approve of every dish that left the kitchen, true dedication! The staff was very attentive, professional and personable!  Will definitely return!!",1
8357,"Had an opportunity to try the entire menu at one point in time -  Everything was great! Described what I like in a Wine and they were about to match it will some amazing Greek Wine. I know Cali Wines and regions well - but you will not find Cali Wines at Purple Pig.

Table space is tight... really tight.",1
8358,"Very flavorful...very hard to find (on google or with Uber)...VERY expensive. Dishes were phenomenal,  presentation was beautiful and flavour profile perfect.  However, just know in advance that you're ordering a bunch of $20 to $30 appetizers. Also, no kids menu.",1
8359,"The service and food were incredible. We arrived at 10 pm on a Wednesday night and didn't have to wait long at all. Loved the cheese. Try the Marsala and the Fig accompaniments to your cheese selections. Our plates were all delicious and worth every penny but I especially loved the crispy pig ears and the chicken kebabs. If you like calamari, they do a different spin on it since it isn't fried, but more ceviche-like. I don't usually like ceviche but this calamari was definitely great. A note on transportation: if you go there by Uber and you've never been there before, you'll need to know that the purple pig has a large outdoor patio as the entrance on the street level not the underground street level.",1
8360,"What better way to dine in an establishment which combines Swine, Wine and Cheese. Love the whole concept , idea and execution.

I came here on an evening it took me about 20 minutes to get a seat.The bartender was super nice and after checking the menu, asked his opinion on my choices:  The pork terrine, the bone marrow and the milk braised pork shoulder.  His eyes widened at my choices, or more specifically at the number of them.  He cautioned me that it might be best to go with the terrine and the pork shoulder and should I still be hungry, then order the bone marrow but he thought my choices were right on.

I had a glass of red wine from greece to accompany my meal, My terrine showed up within minutes of my order and the order was big enough that that would have been sufficient for my meal.  The lard on top of the terrine was creamy white and had been warmed to a spreadable buttery softness.  The bread had been toasted to the perfect consistency, providing enough crunch on the outside while keeping a warm center.  The side of fig  marmalade, sort of like a more substantial membrillo, was delicious as well.

When the pork shoulder arrived, the waitress delivering the dish mentioned in passing that it was her favorite dish on the menu..  Seems like my stomach can pick its way through menus rather well.The pork shoulder had been braised for a long time and flaked at the touch of my fork.

For dessert I had the creme filled sicilian iris. Everything from food to service was great.",1
8361,To describe it would be an injustice. You have to go and eat there yourself to understand why!,1
8362,"finally tried this place for Saturday lunch few weeks ago. evening waiting time seems too long like 1-2
hours or even longer if you go there during peak.

we planned to be there for the opening time. people already made lines 20-30 mins prior to 11am.

we got there exact at 11am and didn't have any problems for getting a table.

lots of pork dish for sure per name. we tried pork shoulder, prom BLT sandwich. both decent.

my favorite was squid dish stuffed with grains and salad. another favorite was warm olive and cheese. surprisingly good when olives are warm with cheese.
seasonal salad was very good.
dessert we had Greek donuts with housemade ice cream swirl.

would definitely go back!",1
8363,"I wasn't expecting it to be so packed on a Thurs night. But now I know why.
Wine selection is amazing- by the glass, half bottle or bottle.
Start with a cheese plate and some extra bread. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and helpful at making recommendations.
The lamb that I had was so perfectly cooked it was insane.
It's pricey, but it IS a Tapas bar in the Loop! I would definitely go back, and I wish they had something like it closer to me.",1
8364,"The food is definitely the best we had on this 1-day spur of the moment excursion to Chicago.  It completely blew our mind.  The Lobster cannoli has creamy filling with sweet ocean flavor of a cold water shellfish.  The cannoli shell is lightly salted, airy and crispy, perfect compliment without stealing any thunder.  We also shared the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder.  This is by far the most tender, succulent and flavorful pork shoulder we ever had.  Step aside Pulled Pork, we have a new pork dish in town that does nothing but knock your socks off.  For dessert, we opted for the Sweet Corn Ice Cream.  Definitely an acquired taste.  It's like a blend of creamy grit with soft serve accented with bits of sweet corn.  I felt like I should also be eating Southern Fried Chicken and Waffle with it.  On a short note, the place is very noisy and crowded.   They don't take reservation of any kind!  I know, sucks.  There is not much square footage to it and you're dinning at a large table with other strangers with very little elbow room.  Not much ambiance to it and that was our least favor part of this dinning experience and the only reason keeping The Purple Pig from earning a 5 stars from me.",1
8365,"Great meal.. Was busy, and I could only get a table at the bar.. But the squid ink pasta and the recommended wine was a great combo",1
8366,"My wife and I ate here, and had the whipped feta, and other appetizers...all mind blowing.  The crown jewel was their pate’, which was a religious experience.  Will be back for dinner options as these appetizers were straight up, off the chain.",1
8367,Such a great place to share food.  We had the pigs ears with kale that were tasty.  Salmon was fabulous as was calamari.  Really enjoyed the eggplant bruschetta with goat cheese.  Nice appetizer of fried manchego cheese.  A wow ending with a sponge cake with an amazing filling and cider vinegar sorbet.,1
8368,"Oh the great choices you'll make because almost everything on the menu is both saviryand memorable.  The cocktails too! The service is from start to finish attentive and they pay attention to little details like when your water glass is empty.
Can't wait to visit again.",1
8369,"Wow. An outstanding food experience at the Purple Pig. An array of tantalizing dishes that will leave you totally satisfied. The eclectic menu will have your mind swirling on what to select. Engage the staff and they will gladly offer you some scintillating choices. The duck prosciutto was absolutley delicious. The goat cheese with the merlot jam...yes, a merlot jam will have you smiling from ear to ear. Excellent wine and beer selections to go with your food. Be prepared to wait for a seat. Your friends, family, and you will have a fantastic time and lots of fun.",1
8370,"After having a less than great experience with a hostess at a different restaurant... we canceled our reservation and decided to go across the street to eat dinner for our 1st Wedding Anniversary at The Purple Pig. It is our first time in Chicago and were told by past travelers that we needed to try The Purple Pig. We were frustrated with the other restaurants hostess across the street, but The Purple Pigs staff were amazing and turned our anniversary dinner ""mood"" around. We had to wait for a table (no big deal) and our cocktail waitress and waiter were so attentive and we could not believe how fast the service was! It was so busy and they came with our drinks so fast! They were very nice and always greeted us with a smile. Then we were sat in the very back by the service door... the manager quickly came and moved us to a different table. I didn't get her name but she was a pretty  blonde. She was very sweet, and checked on us about 3 times throughout our meal (despite how packed the restaurant was). And our server Adam was AMAZING! I told Adam it was our anniversary and that we had a terrible experience with a hostess across the street, however we did want to try out this restaurant. Not that it was his fault, but he came out with an appetizer on the house anyway, just to try to turn our night around! How awesome is that?!  Then, Adam recommended two perfect dinner dishes! The food was melt in your mouth perfection. Adam was always smiling and very attentive. Now to the dessert menu, Adam again recommended the perfect dish. It was AMAZING! And they put a lit candle on the dish for us. My husband and I couldn't get over how good the food and service was. Even the server in the section next to us kept coming over to check on us. The bussers/ back of house staff were also attentive the entire meal. They were consistently taking away dirty plates and always had a big smile on their face. They definitely turned our night around and we had the best anniversary dinner because of them. I cannot say enough, how awesome their staff and food are. I'm only sorry we didn't think to eat there in the first place. We will definitely be back before we head back to Texas!",1
8371,"My boyfriend and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary here and it was an amazing experience. Great location, even better food. We enjoyed everything except one thing, the table. Sadly, we had a wobbly table that kind of made it hard to enjoy the restaurant, but we looked passed it and still had the best 1 year annivsary ever. Thank you Purple Pig.",1
8372,Great atmosphere and fantastic food! I've been here a few times and every time it is incredible. The staff is always friendly and helpful as well. A must in Chicago! A heads up: it gets very busy!,1
8373,"Amazing food as long as you don't mind waiting. With no reservations and popularity rising, the Purple Pig sometimes has a wait hours long. However, once you get in, the dishes are adventurous yet delicious. Come here to try something new!",1
8374,"Good but my experience not as good as some.  First it was over $100 for dinner for two.  I'd call it $$$.  Sangria was best i've had.  And pastry dessert was good - just a little too much Midwest sugar in it though.   Other dishes were either too salty or a theme of a heavy amount of vinegar taste.  And loud.   We had 5 dishes n none wowed us.
If i found a time it was not do crowded i might go back.  I miss Portland where i've been wowed so many time by amazing tastes.",1
8375,"Great food, amazing atmosphere, and quick service. All of the dishes our server suggested were good; I especially loved the Quail with raspberry compote. I have always loved small plates restaurants and if you love sharing this is one of the best spots to go. My boyfriend and I were visiting Chicago for about a week and found this gem close to our hotel. You have to be sure to get there relatively early though, the line up around 6 pm lead all the way out to the street.",1
8376,"After hearing about it for a long time I finally took the opportunity when family was in town to try out the Purple Pig. First, the biggest negative...the wait. It's becoming the norm for popular restaurants to not take reservations, and the Purple Pig is no exception. On the upside, due to the location you can go shopping while waiting, but be prepared for something very long. On to the food. This is tapas style dining, so in the vein we ordered many dishes. As everyone else has indicated, the pork shoulder is not to miss. It's incredibly tender, though very small. The bone marrow, on the other hand, was the one dish we felt was actually too big. It's incredibly rich and comes with a large bone split into two. It was the one plate we had trouble finishing. The cauliflower ended up being one of the favorites at the table, with the greek cornbread being the least liked since it just seemed like regular cornbread with honey and fetas thrown on top. Overall if you have the time, I definitely recommend this place and trying as many different dishes as possible.",1
8377,"Always busy but for all the right reasons. Service is quick and the staff is super friendly. I ordered their version of the croque maddame and it was full of pork amazingness. It was all reasonably priced, and if you are with a small group you could be able to get a seat really quick. I would definitely eat here again!",1
8378,"Came early, so seating wasn't an issue.  Atmosphere is amazing and food is divine.  Very cool vibe with a comprehensive wine list for the venue.  I'd recommend to anyone that finds themself hungry on the Magnificent Mile!",1
8379,"Awesome plates, reasonably priced.",1
8380,"My husband and I had dinner at the Purple Pig on a Wednesday night.  The place was jammed, but we got two spots at the bar right away.  The food was unique and totally delicious.   And despite being very busy, we got our appetizer and entrées very quickly!   We were very impressed!",1
8381,"I had the pork belly special and the smoked pork tongue.  I didn't think they were anything special, but am giving it a four star due to the employees there were all very nice.",1
8382,"Broccoli, turkey leg and whatever your server recommends and you won't be disappointed!",1
8383,"This restaurant doesn’t even deserve a star. I came here because it has such high reviews, it’s the worst restaurant I have ever been at.
I ordered steak and no one asked me how I like it, it was served to me rare and I don’t eat steak rare. My boyfriend ordered short ribs and they were simply disgusting.
They have only two bathrooms which are shared, line was ridiculously long with men and women.
Even soda was flat, no bubbles. I do not recommend!!!",0
8384,"After 45 minutes of waiting, my food never arrived.🤬🤢🤮🤮",0
8385,"Service and food were both fantastic! We sat at the bar and took the recommendations of the bartender who was very friendly and attentive, despite how busy it was. Wow, we loved everything we tried! Our unexpected favorite dish was the fried brussel sprouts, they are this surprising combination of citrus, thyme and flaky crunchy texture. We also tried burrata cannolis, mushroom ragioletto, and the loukoumades for dessert. Can't go wrong with any of those! Mmmm! Can't wait to go back!",1
8386,"Fellow v egans listen up!!! This was one of the top dining experiences I've had! They altered the summer squash and the mushroom shawarma to fit me needs, and they nailed it! Definitely recommend, I know I'll be back. I suggest stopping in to put in your name and check the wait, as they do not take reservations.",1
8387,So the portions are all small and they want you to split everything with your group so that you will order a lot of things. For $16 I got a pork shoulder which was really good but that's all I got. It doesn't come with veggies or bread. This place is okay at best. I won't come here again though.,1
8388,"I went to this restaurant for a birthday date on a Saturday evening. It has a nice ambience, and it was different from your usual TGIF and Chilis restaurants, but it was a bit crowded and the wait was 2 hours long. For the food, I had the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. It was good just somewhat salty. Also, if you are allergic to seafood the menu is somewhat limited because they cook their seafood dishes on the same hibachi grill as the other foods.",1
8389,Great selection of food and wine.,1
8390,"Great place to eat! I wish the waiting time would not be so long, but it is worthy! Spanish octopus and pork belly were my favourites from the different options we tried.",1
8391,Awesome food. Has outdoor seating. You can generally get a table just walking in. May have to wait 15 minutes but very versatile seating. Wonderfull food will definitely eat there again.,1
8392,"This is not a Mediterranean restaurant.  However, the food is very fresh and tasty.  I bit overpriced for food, and extremely overpriced for wine.  No bottle of wine below $60.  Really??  Good experience for a one-time dinner, but will not be going back.",1
8393,"Amazing food with minor room for improvement. Food was incredible - we enjoyed the fried pig ear dish with sautéed kale, pickled chilies, and a fried egg, as well as the pork belly + tenderloin dish. All cooked and balanced to near perfection. Pink guava and fromage blanc mousse dessert was the ideal amount of rich sweetness while still being light.

One item to know before planning a meal -  Purple Pig doesn’t take advance reservations, so go early and put your name in. During peak times, a table for four can be up to a three-hour wait. Host station will alert (text) you when a table is ready, so you can go explore or get a drink somewhere while you wait.

Other option is to try and snag a bar seat. This is a bit of an animalistic free-for-all, so people are waiting to pounce on the first open stools. Would be helpful for staff to ask guests to avoid leaving single open seats, allowing more guests to be seated. Any sort of orderly system for seating bar patrons would also be helpful.

Overall a great meal at a competitive price. Two dishes + dessert, two drinks, and a post-meal coffee w/ tip was ~ $100. Tough to beat in the heart of the Mag Mile.",1
8394,"Great food, great service, great location, great atmosphere, and great coffee.
You can go here with a suit and tie or with some casual clothes.
There is delicious food for all diets, including vegans.",1
8395,"The food is delicious and incredibly rich. While most of the food may be shared, some of the smaller plates makes for an awkward sharing experience.  In particular, the deep fried deviled egg is $7 per order, but it only comes with one egg that would need to be hacked every which way.",1
8396,Been wanting to try PP for a while. Ended up here on a rainy Saturday brunch and took advantage of outdoor seating. Waiter helped us navigate incredible choices with were all superior. Stuffed squid and broccoli had us full when the pork Shoulder came. It was unevenly seasoned with strong herby bursts but overall delicious. We couldn't resist getting dessert. 2 take a while and we were short on time so we went with the panna cotta which was out of this world. Will definitely go back.,1
8397,"I would say the restaurant is a bit overrated. The taste is not as good as expected, there are better ways to cook pork and octopus. Also I hate it when waiters always ask me to take the unfinished plates with a poker face. Overall it is okay but I will not go again.",1
8398,Great atmosphere and fantastic food! I've been here a few times and every time it is incredible. The staff is always friendly and helpful as well. A must in Chicago! A heads up: it gets very busy!,1
8399,"Expectations for me were: good food, overpriced (tourist area), good service.

I was honestly disappointed. The menu is surprisingly complex: don't bring any picky eaters.

The waiter failed to bring extra bread (had to ask 3 times) and then proceeded to wait at our table while we got our credit cards out.

For the quality and quantity of food, I was pretty disappointed.",0
8400,We had a wonderful experience here. We sat at the chef's bar where you get to watch them make the food and ask the chef's questions. Very hearty meal with lots of elevated comfort dishes.,1
8401,"Everything my husband and I had was amazing.  I do hate the seating. Tables are far too close together. It is a city, however, most of the restaurants have much better seating for a more intimate comfortable experience.",1
8402,"The Purple Pig is a pretty amazing restaurant. The dishes are meant to be served to a group. Had a 2.5 hour wait but it was well worth it. We had the turkey confit, raw asparagus, brocolli with garlic, chicken kebabs and wagyu beef. In short, every dish was simply amazing, from the appetizers to the entrees. At the end, there was no room for dessert. The only tip is be prepared to hang out for a while since there are no reservations and the wait is usually 2+ hours. They will offer cocktail service outside as you wait for your table. The service was excellent and it was well worth it. Only downside, it's pretty noisy, so you probably don't want it to be a date spot.",1
8403,Food is great. When this place opened the customer service was top notch. The love for the people was great. Since gaining huge fame they have lost this touch. Again food is great but the customer service from the servers needs to go back to the basics and show the love this place once had,1
8404,"My wife and I shared multiple small plates. Every single dish was so good, I had a hard time choosing a favorite!",1
8405,very good food!! very loud trendy place.the staff is frriendly too!,1
8406,"The Purple Pig restaurant is reason enough on its own to visit Chicago. We’re from Los Angeles but find ourselves in Chicago once a year for a couple nights ahead of a nearby conference we attend. We discovered the Purple Pig by accident during our first visit when we attempted to visit a wine, cheese and chocolate restaurant across the street that happened to be closed for remodeling. “The Purple Pig” sign across the street was inviting…”Let’s see what’s over there” I said to my wife after it became a reality that we wouldn’t be eating at a wine, cheese and chocolate restaurant. We have returned every year and The Purple Pig has become the one given thing that we will do on every visit to Chicago.

On this particular visit, everything that came out of the kitchen looked gorgeous, like super artsy yummy comfort food, and the looks of joy on people’s faces when their food arrived at their tables were pretty universal.

They have extensive wine, beer, aperitifs, liqueurs and cocktails (classic and house) menus. I had the Green Acres cocktail (egg white, chocolate bitters, tequila.) It had extraordinary texture and was very well mixed.

I also opted for “3 cheeses”. These folks really know what they’re doing with cheese. I don’t remember all three that I had, but I’m fairly confident that from now on, if it’s not the 10 Year Old Cheddar, they served me, it’s not as good as it can get.

One dessert item we didn’t order, but which we saw walk by several times was the “Sicilian Iris” was a brioche ball with ricotta and chocolate chips, covered with powdered sugar. It looked like it would kill you dead with its awesomeness. Some day Purple Pig…some day.

There are many options for vegetarians, and drinkers, and people who just love food in general.

The place is also always super crowded…at least the five times we’ve stopped in over the last several years. But we’ve never actually had to wait for a table despite this…just lucky, or maybe most people waiting were standing by for outdoor seating.

On a side note, years after we first visited The Purple Pig, we discovered it on a list of America’s ten best restaurants. What an incredibly happy accident discovering this place.",1
8407,"Had lunch here on a business trip not to long ago and will definitely go back. Food and wine selections were excellent. Note its a small portions type of place, but the food was excellent, fresh and presented well. Waitress was attentive and friendly. Sea",1
8408,Great food and great atmosphere. Right on Michigan avenue. Had to wait about an hour on a weekday. But you can easily kill the wait time by having a few drinks on the patio. Pretty nice beers and extensive list of wine. Highly reccommend Kale and Pig ear. Service was perfect also for such a busy place.,1
8409,"The place gets packed. Lots of tourists come here--it is on a lot of lists. Tapas style. We got a few dishes to try, such as cheese plate, pig ears, bone marrow spread with bread, lamb (?) shank. It's family style too, so you might have to share tables. I enjoyed the meal. Parking can be hard to find though.",1
8410,"Consistently good, creative food. Approachable menu that is well executed. Tables are hard to come by so come early and/or be prepared to wait a little - easy(ish) to grab a drink at the bar while you wait. Or, grab a seat at the bar, if available - gives you a front row for the action in the kitchen and closer proximity to the flowing libations. Service is always on point.",1
8411,"I am displeased with my experience at The Purple Pig. The ambience makes you feel like you’re sitting on lower Wacker Dr, our table might have well been in an alleyway. The décor in the restaurant is pathetic at best. The servers are dressed in street wear and an apron, they are covered from head to toe with “body artwork” and piercings galore. Our waitress had a foul mouth and had no personality. I have received better service at a McDonald’s on the south side. The food proportions were small, and overpriced. The food did not taste like it was freshly prepared. It tasted like they pre-make the orders. Be prepared to stand in a long line to use the washroom as they only have two single-user bathrooms. For a restaurant that serves wine I expected more than a mediocre experience. I will not be eating here again in the near future or ever.",0
8412,"Food was a 4, service a 4, atmosphere a 3. Tasty dishes that were slightly bigger than tapas-style sizes. Service was a bit scattershot as they use multiple servers to take orders, deliver food, and clear table- seemed like a bit of merry-go-round with the service. Also had an inexplicable kerfuffle with the wine order which seems a bit odd.Atmosphere is almost untenable- the place is so loud that you are unable to carry on a conversation with someone sitting directly across the table from you. Add the frenetic pace of the servers and the apparent ""yelling"" from the kitchen, and it makes for a down-right intense dining experience, and not relaxing at all. Not a good date night place but could serve a post-work happy hour-style crowd. Also verged an it on too touristy but its location is to blame for that.",1
8413,"We arrived as early as the place opened. We were seated immediately along with 20 others that were waiting outside. The service was great. The food was fantastic, and great portion. We couldn't finish it all. Will definitely visit again if we're in Chicago",1
8414,"Love this place! Always bustling. Hard to get a seat during prime times but recommend hitting here in the afternoon for a late lunch and a drink. Great wine options and cocktails, and very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Food comes fast, tastes great and is perfect for sharing.",1
8415,"Fantastic food, superb service and the most congenial atmosphere.  The chef is a genius.  Every dish we tried was delicious, the fave beans,pig tail,turkey leg, marrowk, turkey confit .This chef has a profound understanding of food.  One of our best eating experiences. The drinks are terrific too.",1
8416,"Nice atmosphere, great food, and excellent service.",1
8417,One of the best places and must visit place in Chicago on the magnificent mile. Great fancy food and drinks. The best way to eat there is buy multiple plates if in a group of people and share as a sampler.  You get to taste and enjoy multiple dishes that way.,1
8418,"Every time, lights out good... Great flavors for the meat eaters of the world.  Lamb riblets are to die for, octopus is hearty and bursting with great flavor.  Waiters are attentive but unobtrusive.  It's loud, so be prepared for that... Wine list is exclusively anti-North America but tons of choices.  Can't say enough great things - phenomenal value!",1
8419,Wait 20 mins to get seated. But the food is absolutely worth the waiting. Dishes are delicious and creative. The price is relatively very low compared to other restaurants at this level in Loop. Hope you can provide valet parking in future.,1
8420,I've been trying to come to the PP but never managed to until now. The hot dog was delicious as well as deserts. Good selection of beers to accompany food.,1
8421,"Very relaxing environment and cool. You for sure will have to wait aprox. 1 hour for a table, but it's totally worth it. Braised shoulder is amazing, beets are great, and spanish gin tonics are out-of-this-world.",1
8422,You can't  go wrong at The Purple Pig.  Did not have lunch reservation but were seated at the bar. Service was great and food was even better.,1
8423,The shoulder and the ribs were awesome. The pork was slow cooked and fell apart as soon as I tried to cut it. The place has many unique dishes and I highly recommend it.,1
8424,"Neither the name nor the Google description does justice to the place. Creative nouveau cuisine with its own unique twist in unexpected combinations dot the entire menu.
From appetizers to smears (bread with toppings) to seafood to entrees, pick and choose several small plates and share with your dining partners. Combine that with equally different beverages, desserts, cocktails and other alcoholic drinks and you have a gastronomic celebration on your hands.
Grand service such as replacing your silver and napkins when you partake a dish to get you ready for the next, helpful staff that knows the menu inside out and is ready to make specific recommendations, if asked, is part of the charm.
A bit on the pricey side but well worth it. Go there!",1
8425,"Great, busy atmosphere with excellent staff who made the experience great. We didn't have a bad dish and all the pork dishes were absolutely delicious. The pig tail stuffed peppers was the favorite.",1
8426,"Always a great experience all around! Amazing food offerings and some of my favorite Greek wines. It can be tough to get a seat, but it's worth a wait!",1
8427,"I totally thought this was a tourist trap because it's right on Michigan Av but I kept hearing great things about this place so decided to try it. First, they don't take reservations and it can be a while before you get a seat, but food was really amazing. The texture and flavors were well played and beer selection is great. There was a vegan woman next to us that mistakenly was having lunch there and even she was raving about the few but tasty meatless entrees. Definitely going back, but probably during winter when all the tourists are gone",1
8428,"We had the whipped feta, the bone marrow, osyters, lamb chops, and the black truffle ice cream sandwich. Everything was excellent except the dessert - truffle does not belong in ice cream. We also tried the Colombian Old Fashioned; it was very good. I will definitely try to return next time I'm in Chicago.",1
8429,"This place is amazing if you like sharing and trying lots of different things.  Everything we had was delicious, especially the beets.  Didn't try the wine, but there was a huge selection.  Good cocktails as well.",1
8430,"Everything we tried was amazing! The pork belly was cooked to perfection, and I'd never tried octopus before but it tasted fantastic. Well worth the trip",1
8431,"I can definitely see why this place attracts so many people.  It's located next to Millennium Mile shopping street so expect to see a lot of tourists.  We were here around Noon on a Sunday and was able to be seated right away.

Alright so here is the damage:
1. Bone Marrow: they give a pretty good portion of bone marrow and you smear it over bread, season with salt and top it off greens and BOOM! It's magic in yo mouth
2. Calamari (antipasti): I was expecting something fried but it wasn't.  Not my favorite.  It's okay.
3. Pig Ears: sounds adventurous but they are fried so you can't really taste them per say?  They cook it with a crisp kale salad and man it was good!
4. Pork Shoulders - Get it period! They injected something into the sauce! It's not even fair to talk about it.  Just get it!
5. Seafood sakanagi - Again these weren't my favorite. They are okay.  It is served with their own italian-esque sauce over the muscles and couple shrimps.

The staffs were super attentive.  Friendly and helpful with the menu.  Keep in mind this place is a tad in the higher cost than what I usually pay for these small tapas in the same quality.  They are unique I'd say though.",1
8432,"Delicious food!  Not disappointed in the least.
We had the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder and the Fried Pizza Neapolitan,  which was recommended by our awesome waiter.
Great experience!",1
8433,"Went on a Friday night. Wait time was one hour. Which was fine, we got to walk around and enjoy the city. They sent a text to let us know our table was ready. The service was excellent and the food was incredible. It was a night to remember! We will definitely be coming back!",1
8434,"I took my friends here for their visit to Chicago. We were a group of 6 people and each probably spent 35$ including tip.

Liked: The spreads were really good. We tried at least 3 different kinds including the pork liver. We also had the turkey leg, pork shoulder, and bone marrow. All very delicious.

Disliked: The place is a bit small and they do not take reservations. Also, keep in mind the 20% mandatory gratuity for large groups 6 or more.",1
8435,"This is a great place with great food! I had an amazing night, with a small group of close friends. The restaurant can be good for bigger groups as well anyway. The cocktails are good, but the best part is the food indeed, and Coming from an italian, that's something :) the cannoli  with burrata are very delicious, and the beetroot salad as well. They really put a lot of effort into the ingredients but also on the presentation. I'll definitely be back when in Chicago again.",1
8436,Amazing food and wonderful service!,1
8437,"Great food, fast service, good coffee. Photo of deep fried Pizza",1
8438,"The Purple Pig is Chicago's finest restaurant.   Every dish we had was delicious, unique and well thought out. I can't wait to go back.",1
8439,"Appetizers and service was good. The main dish wasn't bad, but it also wasn't amazing.",1
8440,"Fantastic experience. Tasting menu was outstanding, service was as good as any I've had anywhere, including the 2 and 3 Michelin star restaurants in Chicago. The only slight knock was the decision to seat a couple with an infant who was crying in the bar area. Other than that a flawless dining experience.",1
8441,Here they have a completely different style of cuisine respect to clean classical American one. The dishes are shared and it is really worthy in order to try different plates. It is a bit expensive. Usually there is to wait here - especially at popular dinner hours.,1
8442,"Great find with food until midnight!  We tried the whipped feta and the octopus, both of which were very good.  But the Quail and Waffle was just umami amazing.  Excellent wine and beer selection.   Looking forward to returning!",1
8443,"This is a must try for all the foodies in Chicago. I was visiting friends in Chicago and my friend made reservations for this place way in advance. I wanted to be blown away but the food was a little too salty for my tastes - felt like I had to keep drinking water to keep my sodium levels intact haha. We tried several dishes but of course had to try the famous bone marrow. There is a decent amount, though super fatty. The meal wasn't very memorable but at least I can say I've tried it! I guess that's my motto for most things. I do like the ambiance of the restaurant, the restaurant is always lively and has a great view of the river. I also like how its located on Magnificent Mile so I can work off some fat/calories after I eat!",1
8444,Awesome!  Best place on the Mag Mile.  Serious contender for best restaurant in the City.,1
8445,"Was here two years ago and thought it was phenomenal… What a decline. It was not clean at all, the people were not nice at all, all they were worried about was rushing you in and rushing you out gave a 2 1/2 hour wait when it was really 35 minutes, people that were coming in while we were eating they were telling them a three hour wait and that would be after they were closed when they Had open tables. When we asked the waiter for suggestions he said everything is good, when we asked him for specifics he rattled off so fast we couldn’t even understand what he was saying he really didn’t care about our dining experience he just wanted us to rush through it so he could get another table. The people sitting next to us in the community table were screaming at each other this the restaurant has no control over it but they do have control if they see you at a community table. The food was nowhere near as good as the last time the octopus tasted decomposed like it was marinated too long, the turkey leg had so much salt it made the hair stand up on the back of your neck, and the beets were just OK not much different than canned beets. It was so disappointing to us that we didn’t even order a second round of plates we just left",0
8446,"Exceptional. Awsome wine list. Great variety of inventive dishes. It's hard to leave. Sat at the bar, the server was knowledgeable, helpful, top notch. So happy this is now open at this location.",1
8447,"The porchetta, kimchi sandwich was probably the best pork sandwich I've ever eaten. I don't care for beets. The roasted beets with pistachio butter and whipped cheese were delicious.
The service was very attentive. The atmosphere is comfortable.
Save up a few pennies and go. You'll thank me as you're drooling pork fat.
Sorry, no foodie pics; I was too busy eating to pull out my phone.",1
8448,"Oh man. So good. I thought a 2 hour wait would be something to hold against them, but it is so worth it. Camp out on the deck and drink wine and cocktails if you have to. Just get in there and eat. Had  the beef, pork shoulder, turkey leg, chicken skewers... all well seasoned and full of flavor. The broccoli, asparagus, and fried potatoes were delicious all by themselves. I'm a dessert person and I couldn't even fit it in - all the more reason to go back.",1
8449,Great service and variety of food. Was seated at a shared table which added to the experience. Between the two parties at the table we almost tried all the items on the menu. Highly recommended.,1
8450,"Hands down, one of the best places, I've ever been to! The food, the wine, the atmosphere all superb. If you're ever in Chicago you have to visit! Come with a big appetite to try several dishes. I plan to visit again, most definitely, next time I'm in town!!",1
8451,Great food. Pork was so tender and tasty. Place was packed over 1hr wait. Staff was slow to take order but food came out fresh and hot. Little pricy but definitely worth a visit or two.,1
8452,"Strolling down Michigan Avenue, I saw the Purple Pig from across the street and recalled having saved it in my Yelp bookmarks. Within minutes, we crossed over and got the last two seats at the bar for a late lunch.

We ordered:
+ Grilled broccoli with roasted garlic and toasted breadcrumbs in an anchovy vinaigrette ($11)
+ Ricotta gnocchi with spring onion pesto, peas, and fava beans in a neck bone gravy ($17)
+ Milk braised Berkshire shoulder with mashed potatoes and puffed farro ($19)

The broccoli and ricotta gnocchi were fantastic. My favorite was definitely the gnocchi. I especially liked the anchovy vinaigrette and neck bone gravy that accompanied the respective dishes - wonderful sauces! The shoulder was unfortunately a bit dry and the puffed farro was not cooked all the way, so that was a bit disappointing. We lamented later that we should have ordered the bone marrow. The dishes overall have great flavor, although the menu feels like it's doing a lot. Everything from cheeses to panini to crispy pig's ears, pork tongue, house-cured sardines, grilled octopus, blade steak, and turkey leg confit.

This is a super, super popular restaurant. We were lucky to get seats without reservations. The space is extremely tight, so be prepared if you're claustrophobic. I was shoulder to shoulder with my BF and a nice stranger. Still, well worth a visit if you're in Chitown and like the shareable tapas concept among close friends.",1
8453,Great food. Intelligently pushing boundaries but efficiently designed. Great service very personable guided us through our meal well with great recommendations tailored for my wife and I. All around fantastic experience I hope to return the next time I'm in Chicago.,1
8454,"Wow. Very diverse tapas. Good beer selection. Decent cheese & charcuterie board. Inventive twists on all kinds of dishes, Mediterranean & Spanish, etc. One of the best eating experiences we've had in Chicago.",1
8455,"Holy ship....I mean, wow...the food was amazing! O had the short ribs, the green asparagus, the whipped goat cheese, the...ok. we ordered almost everything. We had a party of 9 and we just ate everything. Amazing!",1
8456,"Not impressed. Good wine and cheese, good fusion of Greek-international dishes in principle, but everything is covered in sauce. When there's so much sauce and condiments in food, the basic quality cannot be good",1
8457,Food is as good as expected. Lamb ribs were just peeeeeerfect. The wine list is spectacular. I had a Chardonnay from Greece and a Shiraz from Bulgaria. Two surprisingly good choices.,1
8458,"The interior atmosphere is amazing with high ceilings and antique appearing decor. It's always packed full of people and can be a fun and noisy place. Many of the plates are over-seasoned, but the drinks are great.",1
8459,"The food is kind of unique or of its own. Taste wise, pretty good! The only drawdown was many things are either deep fried or cooked with fat. Pretty greasy and fell full after having the meal.",1
8460,Great food. Be adventurous. Recommend the pork neck gravy dish and the braised pork shoulder. Not to bad as far as price. Great ambience. Toughest part is the parking. I suggest to take public trainsportation down to the area and walk.,1
8461,"We came at a busy time and the wait time was an hour and half but we left the restaurant tummy happy. So dont get frustrated or annoyed (its a very popular resto) put your name on the wait list and go wander or shop around the river area cause the restaurant is smack right in downtown and its easy to kill time (we went to cloud gate).

We ordered the chicken skin (👍🏼lots of flavours), broccoli (👍🏼maybe slight sour),deep fried pizza (👌🏼its alright just a big puffy dough with toppings on it) and last but not least the pork belly (🤤🤤a sweet balanced lean meat ratio to fat that melt in your mouth). After that just no room for dessert.

The service was friendly and definitely fast given that its so packed and full and the first dish came about 10mins.",1
8462,"tried the beet goat cheese medley for the appetizer, also the Greek salad tasted good. The pig cured plaster was divine. excellent wine selection very expensive. Expect to get great service great food and spend a great amount of money.",1
8463,"I feel sad to give them a 2 because I goggled the best places to eat in Chicago, but I was so disappointed. The atmosphere is amazing and menu set up, like being in my dad's Butcher shop as a kid but the food or shall I say dish I ordered was horrible. It turned my stomach. Being from Wales I am extremely used to lamb and crave it as lamb is one of our main exports. I ordered the lamb ribs. Which were over cooked, over blackened (burned) then way to sweet. Lamb = burned = sugar = yuck!! A lamb should always be paired to bring out its own natural sweetness such as cucumber, mint etc. A tender meet on its own. The harsh flavors only covered the meats potential. A true sadness. I felt as though I had eaten a very  aweful left over BBQ.",0
8464,Awesome food and great experience overall.,1
8465,Great food though the restaurant is loud,1
8466,"Worst waiting experience ever!! Plenty of Seating open, still made us wait one hour and a half to be seated! However, they do make up for it! Great quality!! Awesome sharable dishes!! And flavor on point!!",1
8467,"Food was fabulous but very expensive. Small tapas type portions at 15ish dollars each, staff advise two dishes per person. Our meal for 4 quickly mounted up to 140 dollars when drinks tax etc  added.",1
8468,"Everything is excellent. Food, ambiance, and best of all, the best service. The servers are all very happy. It is packed when we went but did not mind the waiting at all. Try the pork shoulder topped with mash potato puree. It is to die for.",1
8469,"Great food and suggestions on wine pairing! Had the foie gras with Sauternes, while the milk braised pork shoulder with Croatian 100% Babic was great too. Bone marrow was the biggest one we’ve seen and had before on our travels - and it was buttery goodness spreading it on the bread provided.

Charcuterie: N’duja and Duck Prosciutto which were also rich and savory.

Only downside was the wait (both to get a table and the food out - it was more than 20 minutes before our charcuterie board arrived as the first dish)",1
8470,"Wide variety of unique food items but timing is screwy.   Our waiter waiter warned that food is delivered as soon as it is ready, not all at once.  Met friends for lunch. It is awkward to eat when you are the only person with food....do you eat or wait?  A 2nd plate was delivered and we started as our food was hot.  Another plate arrived a few min later but the last one got there as the rest of us were finishing.  I appreciate being served right off the grill food but it makes for an awkward meal.  Would have appreciated a bit of guidance with info about prep times so could plan better.",1
8471,"Recommended by blogger， went there at 1200, lots of table.
Staff are very nice and friendly.
We had octopus, pork blade steak, port shoulder.
Generally on salty side, all those three dishes taste were just ok.",1
8472,Saltimbocca was off the hook. We also really enjoyed the grilled broccoli and chicken kabobs,1
8473,"The Purple Pig made me wait 45 minutes on a Sunday night after I just walked around the city in 90-degree day all day. The wait was nevertheless, rewarding and satisfying.

Who doesn't like some wine and swine? The bar scene is vibrant and the wait is well, gruesome. Yet, once we were seated, we were greeted by a very friendly waitress. The wine list is very extensive and to be honest overwhelming! It does have a good range of wine from around the world at different price point. We had half bottle of pinot grigio and it was only $24!

We got several dishes to share because this would be our last meal in Chicago and we went all out to make sure we try a good selection of food here since we just waited 45 minutes. The bone marrow is absolutely the best on the menu. It is actually a reasonable price too because they gave us 4 big bones with buttery crispy sour dough and cilantro to go with. I love it even though previously I was a little afraid of the texture. The beets salad with goat cheese was surprisingly delicious. In addition, the 3 cheese platter we picked was great. For entree, we shared the fried pig ears and it was so good! You must try that if you like crispy deep fried dish and who doesn't really?! You might be grossed out by ""Ears"" but trust me, ears are very subtle delicacy. We ended our dinner with Pig Tail and it actually tastes like Chinese pork belly stew. The pork was stewed to such tenderness that it falls apart from the bone with sweet savory sauce.

We were so full that we could not get any dessert afterwards.",1
8474,"Cant emphasize enough how disappointing the experience here was. Food was alright but nothing special. What was really frustrating was how cramped, loud, and I’ll lit the restaurant was. My chair was getting bumped the whole time, I couldn’t move my elbows, and the low lighting ment that my deaf and poor eyesight wife could not communicate with me. To make matters worse we were seated at a communal table in an awkward fashion with other small parties, all of which were clearly looking for some privacy. Seemed as if no one had a good conversation going. Not worth the 1 1/2 wait to be annoyed the whole time.",0
8475,"Just happened to be strolling down Michigan Ave when we spotted this gem. We asked the concierge about it but didn't really have much to say but we decided to try it anyway. so glad we did!! The place is a foodies delight and they had one of our favorite wines - LaCartuja from Priorat!! Eating al fresco is a plus in the middle of August but luckily, it was a perfect night for outdoor dining. Cost was pretty reasonable as well. Can't wait to return!!",1
8476,Great service and food recommendations.  Lamb ribs and  pork platter were amazing! They check glasses to make sure they are spotless.  Pork tongue was my favorite.  Great service and food.  Highly recomended.,1
8477,"Come Early. Come Hungry. Come Thirsty. Come with an OPEN MIND for unique food!

I dined here with a friend and we shared 4 tapas. 1: Calamari - The Calamari is NOT fried, but trust and believe it tastes amazing. Since it's poached and served with a light dressing, radishes, and cucumbers it's nearly guilt free :P 2: Salt-Cured Greek Yogurt with Strawberry Rhubarb Preserves & Pistachio. Totally not what I was expecting, but the flavors worked so well together! The greek yogurt was very thick and shaped like mini mozzarella balls and served in a small glass jar. On the side were the preserves, chopped pistachios, flaky salt, and crusty bread. Once assembled the combination of the sweet preserves with the savory/salty pistachios and the flaky salt went so well together! It was hard to share this one with my friend because I loved it so much! 3: Guinea hen. It's fowl, like a wild bird, not like a guinea pig - figured I should point that out. I'm sure that I'll never eat this again because I won't be able to find someone that made it as good as The Purple Pig did. The guinea hen was super tender and served over mashed potatoes (I think) w/ green strawberries and some other veggies. Super unique and very tasty! 4: Steak w/ chimichurri. Outstanding! Perfectly seasoned - melted like butter in my mouth.

Note that your entire party must be present as they will not seat you. They also don't take reservations so come early. My friend and I actually enjoyed sitting at the long communal dining table as we were able to ""food gaze"" - check out what other people ordered and decide if we wanted that for ourselves.",1
8478,The food and service was excellent. Very rich and unique menu) I recieved a recommendation from 2 different people to eat here. My only complaint is the drinks are not well made (martini was watered down and the waitress did not ask how we wanted it made) and the wine and beer was over priced (for the price of a full beer i got 6oz). Still worth going to for the food.,1
8479,"Very happy to have a place with diverse and tasty food right in the center of Magnificent mile. For theater outings, tours, or other cultural events in the Loop, this is my favorite place to dine at.
Purple Pig offers a large menu mostly consisting of small plates/tapas. The dishes are prepared and plated with great care. Ingredients are fresh and sourced locally where possible - so don't be alarmed if you find a caterpillar in your salad, like it happened to one of the diners when i was there last time (you will be rewarded with free dessert).
You can find anything here, from seafood to vegetarian dishes. Some are big wins, like Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg, or Foie Gras & Membrillo smear. Some are just not for me, like Deviled Egg with Arugula & Capers which lacked the familiar deviled egg filling.
Some are tasty with wonderful presentation, like the stuffed octopus special.
Order an espresso to finish your meal and give you a pre-theater pick up. Despite the price tag, if you're the true espresso lover, you will not regret it.
Enjoy the busy and somewhat noisy atmosphere - this place is usually packed so you may end up sharing a table with strangers. This is always a fun way to meet new people. Reservations are not accepted, but you can have a drink from their diverse wine or beer list while waiting outside and admiring the city views.",1
8480,Great meal for all you foodies out there.  Tapas style dining with great service and creative dishes.  A little tight for space but that is the only way to get everyone in this popular place.,1
8481,Good food.....,1
8482,"I had a less-than-awesome experience there.
1. The place was too darn crowded.
2. The waitress didn't care about our table - perhaps we looked too ""young"" to be foodies? Mistake on her part.
3. We ordered ramps but got green onions. And, as foodies, we knew the difference. When we told the waitress, she dismissed us and said ""of course those are ramps"". When we pressed her to ask the kitchen staff to be sure, she came back with a ""sorry, those are just green onions - they ran out of ramps"". Buzzkill.
4. Everything was too salty.

Won't be back :(",1
8483,"Misrepresented on menu. The tongue which is amazing !!! was supposed to be on an Olivier salad (Russian:  potato salad: potato, carrot, pickle, peas, mayo) Instead it is on a pasta w mayo ... no veggies. I avoid grains... so do not eat pasta. Spoke to manager re issue, too busy to deal with it.",0
8484,Octopus a la plancha was really good,1
8485,"This is by far my favourite restaurant!!! Will never visit Chicago without paying The Purple Pig AT LEAST one visit! Amazing food, friendly service, great atmosphere. Seriously love it here. It’s truly a great find on the list of endless Chicago restaurants",1
8486,"Exceptional service, exceptional food. I had the beets, pork chop, and strawberry rhubarb tart - everything was so good. Had the spritz with my dinner, which paired nicely with the pork and an iced Cariello to finish the meal off. Literal chef's kiss.",1
8487,Meh. Food taste the same and equally not delicious. Not worth the wait. Don't believe me? Try ordering turkey leg confit and braised pork. Cooked differently but taste exactly the same. I have no idea how this is featured in michelin recommended guide. Really disappointed.,0
8488,"I had a couple of meats and cheeses which were very good.  My dessert was not good.  It was still frozen.  It was very loud and expensive.  I was by myself and the hostess was rude and made me feel really bad about being by myself.  However, the rest of the service was very good.",1
8489,Believe the hype! Everything we ate was amazing. We lucked up and got there 5 minutes before they opened the doors and sat at the bar. The staff was friendly and helpful. Will 100% return!!,1
8490,I think that I didn't pick out the good food . so that made me put a 4 star the only thing that was good that I pick was the rabbit truffle and the cheese dessert. Every thing else is ok or no good. I had the pork ears with kale and it was very salty but goo at the same time because the egg on top. The lamb whit pesto was sour and salty but the texture was good. The bone marrow was alright i don't know how to explain it. but the worst was the duck liver ( or fa gra) it had a sweetness I didn't like. It was like eating something fat but sweet at the same time. The Rabbit was the best because I has that meaty taste with the truffle aroma and it was well seasoned. the cheese dessert was Really rich and creamy. over all the place was ok I maybe would come back there.,1
8491,"AMAZING FOOD!! Literally AMAZING. The squid pasta, duck, and appetizers are to die for!! I typically don’t write reviews but this place was outstanding!!!",1
8492,"Super flavorful dishes. I got the milk marinated pork shoulder, broccoli, and the nebbiolo wine. Everything paired really well together. I would definitely come back.",1
8493,"The only problem with this restaurant is that it's really difficult to get a table (it took us 4 times to get one). But once you make it, the food is just amazing and original! Service was great too.
I really recommend it, worth the wait.",1
8494,The Braised pork and pork belly was delicious. The bread was a good appetizer to scrape our plate with.,1
8495,Love their wine selections and amazing food. Like the smaller sized portions so you can get a few dishes to share and taste more that way.,1
8496,"Had a very nice time at this restaurant during our visit to Chicago - our server Adam recommended some wonderful dishes. Great atmosphere, sharable portions and genuinely good service all around. Would highly recommend to check this place out; most definitely would go back when visiting Chicago.",1
8497,"Had been waiting for the opportune moment to try given its location in a crowded part of town and no resis, and boy did it deliver. Happy hour ($8 drinks) until 6PM on Friday. Small plates style, but three were plenty for two of us! Come around 5PM to get a seat on a Friday.",1
8498,"I honestly think this place is totally overrated. Chicago has a lot of fantastic restaurants and Purple Pig gets more than it's fair share of oohs and aahs more due to the fantastic location. Food is actually pretty good, but maybe disappointing given the hype. The pork tenderloin was extremely salty and I could barely finish half of it. The service was terrible. Our waiter was not very helpful and it took us more than 25 minutes to get our bill and pay.",1
8499,"The highs were dizzying but there were too many blunders in our experience. The duck was easily one of the most delicious things I've ever put in my mouth, and I'll be dreaming about the gnocchi for years to come. But the pork tongue seemed out of place against a cold macaroni salad, the stuffed squid was undercooked and none of the cocktails we tried lived up to the price tag. If The Purple Pig can strengthen the weak link portion of its game it could be a real contender in the Chicago food scene.",1
8500,"Spectacular food, everything I tried was delicious and cooked to perfection. Julian at the bar did a superb job explaining the dishes and was very attentive. Definitely worth the wait!",1
8501,"I’ve been patronizing the Purple Pig over the past 12 or so years but it’s been a couple until last evening! So I knew a wait and exceptionally busy restaurant with lighting fast service were to expected. While I had no wait for party of 2, efficient service, and phenomenal food, I still left with a bad taste in my mouth. The guy serving wine last night was a complete jerk to me. My friend and I told him either I or my chair were getting hit by the staff innumerable times including a rack of some sort from a bus person scrapped across my back. This was all before the first glass of wine. Instead of any apology or offer to help remedy the situation, he said ‘that’s what happens at the Purple Pig’ (in a tone like he thought I was an unreasonable debutante)! I joked with him ‘is it?!’ quipping that’s a good thing for Purple Pig because I made me want to drink. My friend inquired if he would ask the man behind us to pull up his chair to the chef counter, which was way out in the super skinny aisle behind me. The server chose not to and then proceeded to intentionally hit my chair as he walked away. Not cool, not cool at all. The server we had was what I would call nice nasty and almost too busy to be bothered. It’s not what he said or did but something much more insidious. So at the end of the experience of mouth watering food, excellent wine, and an albeit overly loud but gorgeous restaurant it was the treatment from those handing their hands out for a tip that will make me think twice about returning again. Ciao!!!",0
8502,"I. Love. This. Place.
It says a lot that the kitchen is right out in the open. You can see how clean everything is and the energy is so cool.
We sat at the bar overlooking the cooks. They have an excellent system of quality control--- the chef sent back any burnt toast, food that had too much sauce, etc.
One of the guys noticed how interested we were and made a point to tell us what each meal was. We are definitely coming back for dinner... and probably lunch and dinner tomorrow. There are so many meals that we need to try!!!",1
8503,"Fantastic food, perfect for sharing and great choices for vegetarians. Well priced for the quality of the fare. You will probably have to wait to be seated but it is worth it.",1
8504,"I always come here when my friends visit me from out of town. We all love this place after I discovered it and showed them. Now everytime they come to Chicago, Purple Pig is always a dinner option for one of our nights out. The wait usually isn't too long, but hey who cares when you can just wait along the terrace and get a great view of the Chicago River. In the winter if you are waiting, I love how there are heat lamps on the terrace. They have a nice outside deck you can eat on, or you can eat inside the restaurant. It is pretty small but they do a good job of not feeling crowded among everyone in the middle of the dining area inside. There is a bar which you can eat at, my favorite spot in the whole restaurant. The menu is the best part of this place. I love the food! The meatball is definitely my favorite item here. The fried tendons are also really good, they taste just like salt and vinegar chips but the tendons are like chicharrones. So good. I am a picky eater and even I found a few items that are irresistable. The cheese and wine and bread are also one of my favorite things to order here. Your waiter/waitress will definitely help you out with any questions you have about the menu and they know a lot about the palette and cheese pairings. You just order a bunch of items and each item is like something you can share with your friend/s or try by yourself. The location of this place is nice, right off Michigan Av. Parking should be fairly easy. And if you are on a date night, the AMC theaters are really close by.",1
8505,"The waiter ruined mi experience there. The food was delicious as well as mi mojito. When I asked for my second drink I just asked the waiter to bring me a glass of the house cabernet, It had lots of sediment and when he brought the bill I was charged $23 for a glass of house wine with sediments...that's ridiculous.  If I knew he was bringing me an expensive wine he should have given me the option of chosing  my wine. When I ask for house wine in other restaurants...they bring me the basic not the expensive ones.... and about the sediments he gave me a stupid excuse.",0
8506,"The lomo and cheese were incredibly small servings and I was not impressed with the lomo. I had seen photos of the grilled scallions with romesco online and tried ordering them and was told you can only get them as a side with the scallops (which were not on the menu). I asked for the sardines and was told they weren't serving them right now. The only thing that I ate here that impressed me was the broccoli, which was excellent. Servers tried delivering two different things to me that I didn't order and then delivered my broccoli to a guy who was sitting next to me at one of the communal tables. I wanted to like this place but i was very underwhelmed.",0
8507,Finally I have made it to Purple pig. It was very nice experience! Despite 1 hour long wait and the place is so loud it is hardly possible to enjoy the conversation. Small meals to share and excellent choice of wines made it a nice night!,1
8508,"Wow, very good. The menu can be intimidating. Make sure the server explains it to you or ask others what their having and make new friends.
We had a blast talking with everyone at our table. Enjoy!",1
8509,"The place has good vibe to it. Definitely worth going. I just took away one star coz our food was really greasy to the point we could not finish it.
We had the signature desert dish which was amazing.
Loved the place overall",1
8510,"The small-plates menu format allows for a night of lingering, sampling and experimenting. Feeling bold? Try the crispy pig's ears with kale. Looking for a classic? Hearty osso buco delights. If you saved enough room, a plate of not-too-sweet Italian wedding cookies makes for a delectable coda to an adventurous meal.",1
8511,"In Chicago on business, was recommended for me to find when I got there.
excellent beet dish, octopus also.
Went back. Best pork steak I've ever had.",1
8512,It's no surpise that this place is always packed and the wait time is 45min to 2 hours! It's the best place in this area. Great wine and cheese selection. The small plates are really great! I order calamari with fregula everytime and people are crazy about the smears! My all time favorite.,1
8513,"The SWINE!!! Why would you rave about the SWINE?! Let alone a Purple SWINE!! Because it's absolutely delicious...DUH!!
Prior to my Chi-Town Trip the suggestions kept pouring in about how The Purple Pig was a must visit...a ton of people I know were just raving about this place, for good reason! Amazing DELICIOUSNESS!!

~ Crispy Pig ears - 5/5
Didn't realize it came with a Fried Egg on top. My server told me to mix it all up and eat it...so I took his advice. But first, I had to try a few of the Crispy Pig ears by themselves. Amazing! I'm not sure if this dish was suppose to be an appetizer or a main course. Either way, I'm just glad I ordered it...Crispy, Crunchy, Flavorful...FRIED!!! There's nothing bad about this dish!

~ Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder - 5/5
Another absolutely amazing dish! Tell tale sign...this was something special; it was served with a spoon! NO KNIFE!!! My thoughts at the time: A piece of Pork Shoulder on the Bone served with a SPOON?! Hmmm...are they nuts?! Where is my KNIFE?! Did they make a mistake? Nope. Nope. Nope. They got it right! The meat is so tender, it just falls of the bone...no knife required! The Pork was just PERFECT! Tender, Juicy, full of flavor, complemented brilliantly with the Lentils & Mashed Potatoes. I could find no fault...just wish there was more. #LifeOfAFatty

I will endeavor to stop by here every time I am in Chi-Town! Brilliant!",1
8514,"Although a little crowded and getting a table can be long, the food is most definitely worth it!  Favorites I've eaten there are the artichoke salad, the pork belly (anything!), and any of their deserts.  Be prepared to eat with others you may not know as they will be sitting at the same table as you!",1
8515,"BEWARE. Pay only cash or double check your amount deducted on your card after dining here. Me and my friend split the bill but they charged me the whole amount anyway and then charged my fried the half of the bill too! I've raised my complaint with them and they are completely unresponsive. I mean if you want to loot people, maybe just raise the prices on your menu some more! At least it won't be illegal!",0
8516,Yum!! Love the food and the atmosphere! So fun to go here for lunch. Believe it or not their tuna is awesome. Also their milk braised pork is awesome. I honestly dont think you can make a poor choice here!,1
8517,"Very trendy spot with menu items that your palate can't wait to try. The service is family style, so everything is for sharing. They do not take reservations, so it is important to send at least one person in your party to put down their name. We had a cheese and meat tray, Foie gras, some spreadable meat with cheesy bread and the pork roast. Enjoy your next visit to Chicago!",1
8518,"Went here for a birthday dinner with my S/O. Was suggested to us by a friend and it did not disappoint. We tried several smaller plates from the menu and were blown away. I wanted to try everything on this menu, but couldn’t fit it all in. This is a must check out place if you’re in Chicago.",1
8519,"I came here a while back while visiting some of my colleagues, and was rather skeptical due to my kosher diet. But now, all I have to say is go Greek!  Not in the cult-like way, however. Rather, indulge yourself the myriad of flavors the Purple Pig has to offer. Whether you get lamb, squid, or even pork I'm sure, you'll be begging to come back.",1
8520,"Incredible food, and amazing staff. We were on a trip to Chicago and wanted to do a cullinary tour of the city, so this was on our list. Not only did it exceed expectations, we met some other friendly food travelers and had a great time chatting.",1
8521,"Good place with a nice wine selection. Flavors maybe a little bit too bold, (dishes had very rich soused) but I liked it overall.
Try stuffed squid, octopus and maybe some beets w/goat cheese.",1
8522,Amazing food! Everything tastes amazingly well and every item on the menu will surprise you. We recommended the octopus and the huevos rotos con chorizo. The setting is also really beautiful.,1
8523,"2 hour wait times? Communal tables? A waiter who needed to pull himself out of his own rear end? Mediocre bone marrow?  Sounds like a fantastic time if you're into that kind of thing. My visit here gave me the impress that that this place is way too overhyped, over priced, and generally a pile of meh.

The restaurant is on the scenic magnificent mile, next to the river and the atmosphere is all around pleasant. The restaurant is crowded, slightly cramped, and loud. All the makings of a pleasant rowdy night. I got the pig platter, the bone marrow, and a few other small plates. Delicious cuts of meat are always a good thing, the price was reasonable. The turkey leg confit was fine, it didn't really give me any chills or the feeling of razzle dazzle at all.
The bone marrow on the other hand had nothing special going on whatsoever, roasted meat flavored jello but the kind of jello where grandma puts too much water in it because of her diabetes.

The good: lively atmosphere, good (but expensive) booze selection, communal tables can help you meet that partner of your dreams. Or just touch elbows all evening long and pretend they don't exist.
The not so good: communal tables if you hate that kind of thing, overpriced food, the bone marrow here is like grandma's meat jello but with no razzle dazzle in my mouth.",0
8524,Great fancy spot!,1
8525,True to the name minus the color .Mediterranean dining it is NOT. Pig pork salted beets. Personally I opted out. Friends stayed they state that it was ok not great. Be true to your own taste buds.,0
8526,"There are so many things to like about this place.  It's super-busy, yet the staff is really friendly and will take their time with each customer to answer questions, and make suggestions. The food is amazing, and most things are designed to share so everyone can try a good variety in a single visit. Go early and you will likely get right in. And if you want to see how it's done, ask to sit at the chef's counter.",1
8527,"This place is adventurous. Small plates to share, all of them delicious but if you are a big eater you will end up spending more money than expected. Place is nice, good service but it might be loud. It's right in Michigan Av. Long waits and they do not take reservations but it is worth trying !",1
8528,"This how my grandmother would have cooked! Every dish exhumed flavor and yumminess, what else could you ask for. And service was great too, hostess made sure everything was perfect and didn't hesitate to make recommendations. Purple pig is just another reason to visit Chicago again!",1
8529,"This was perfect for an impromptu planned date. They don’t take reservations so your chances of getting a table are as good as anyone else. As dates go this was my favorite. We had an intimate night of small plates: The beats (whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter wOw), and the donut was most out of this world. This is when i learned that my boo always orders the best thing on the menu.",1
8530,"Incredible food, outstanding and helpful staff and awsome drinks. A total must-go",1
8531,"Excellent! I would highly recommend this place and I am very particular .The wine list, menu, and ambiance were great; not too pretentious but chic modern with nods to classic dishes (charred green onions, roasted marrow bones). Great location and a wonderful ambiance, very well done. Don't waste your time on Girl and the Goat go here instead!",1
8532,"The staff were incredibly attentive, they seated us incredibly quickly, and the food was to die for!  We were shocked at how reasonable the prices were, especially since some of the portions were massive--the turkey leg, OMG!  Can't say enough good things about this place to do it justice.",1
8533,"Came here for a quick bite and drink after we had already eaten dinner.  I couldn't leave Chicago without trying it once.

-Roasted beets were good.
-Duck prosciutto was so good but they give you so little!
-I can't remember what cheese we got but I asked for something that would be the most similar in consistency and taste as gouda.  I really liked what he chose for me!

We were too full for food but I'm glad we still got to try it.  If you only have time for one thing Purple Pig or Girl&the Goat, go to Girl&the Goat.",1
8534,"A unique, bustling, open kitchen restaurant serving huge tapas and amazing wine.",1
8535,"Incredible wine list and lots of lovely small plates. However it is always very very crowded and there is oftentimes a long wait, even to get seating in the entryway tented area. There are people eating and drinking wine with standing room only! Try to go on off-peak hours.",1
8536,"Food looks good, unfortunately we didn’t manage to get in. It was quite busy when we arrived, they took our details including Spanish phone number, and asked us to return at 7:15. We returned on time but apparently they sent us a text message 15 minutes before, which we didn’t receive, so lost our table. According to them it was our fault and we’d have to wait another 30 minutes to get a table. Not the level of service we were expecting.",0
8537,A day spent very well. Excellent services friendly staff. And variety of food are available at the reasonable price. Interior and decor of this place is just other level. Enjoyed a lot. Surely i will be back.,1
8538,"Espectacular!
Love the service, tasty food, amazing selection of wines and great beer. A unique place to have a great meal!
Don't get scared by how crowded it could be, you be taken care.",1
8539,"Excellent food and service. Its a busy place so can be a bit of a wait without a reservation, but its worth it. A unique a delicious menu where nearly every item explodes with wonderful flavours. The only thing I would not recommend is the Ricotta, its a very plain and anticlimactic dish. The sommelier will help you find an appropriate wine combination to your meal. Also try the brussel sprouts. If you are a fan of octapuss, try the octapuss with the roasted potatoes and green beens. Its the most tender, non-chewy octapus I've ever had. The Pork shoulder with mashed potatoes is another simple but excellent dish.",1
8540,"Amazing, and fresh food. Perfect to try out different things. Order 2-3 plates for 2 people. The duck is amazing",1
8541,"Great, creative dishes.  Very expensive, but in my book, worth it if you're looking for good quality, high-end food.  Wine list and pairings are excellent.",1
8542,"Yes and Yes ! Great food, good service!",1
8543,"Wait was longer than quoted and the 2 top we were seated at was in what I would describe as an alley.  An airless spot no one should be subjected to.  It was too hot to stay, so we left.  I imagine the food is great, which is why people are willing to pack in, but I am not hardy enough to deal.",0
8544,"My absolute favorite place!  Always delicious food, great servers and wonderful ambiance!",1
8545,Yum. Everything's great here!,1
8546,"Delicious food! Please note that everytime I've gone I've encountered an hour long line for a table. The best way to get a seat is connect with someone at the bar and patiently wait until their done. Most of the time, you're waiting just 15 - 20 minutes!",1
8547,"In my life, I've never left a meal so perfectly satisfied. Everything from the location, to the decor, to the food itself was phenomenal. This is the kind of place you go to as a celebration, not as a casual dinner.",1
8548,"Outstanding. Menu is very non traditional in the best way... Tons of new favors and tastes always being served here. Can certainly be tourist central, but the bar and food is so good no one really cares.",1
8549,"Trendy food with a good drink menu. Not sure the food is good enough for really long waiting time. Wait was hour and half on a Wednesday night. Was pretty crammed place, had to get up multiple times while I was eating to let people through.",1
8550,"Simply delicious. Had the Brussel sprouts and the Milk braised pork shoulder. Brussel sprouts were savory and well-cooked despite a tad over-seasoned. The pork was perfection in every way - melt-in-your-mouth decadence.

Beer options are not impressive, but I hear it's more of a wine place.",1
8551,"The food was very interesting and very tasty. The presentation was fantastic. I ate at the bar this time and given how busy it was the service was fantastic. The wine and beer choice was good, the cocktail menu was okay.",1
8552,"There's a reason there is always a wait at the Purple Pig... the food here is pretty damn good. If you're a bone marrow person, it's a must order. Likewise with the Octopus. I also had the crispy pig's ears - cutesy presentation but just a bit underwhelming and over salted. If you don't mind dining a little later, I've showed up a little after 9pm and waited less than 20 minutes.",1
8553,Update always delivers! sigh... I heart this place. but I was a bit disturbed by the speed in which they cleared the plates... It almost felt like they wanted us to leave but we are quite thick skinned... so we stayed for hours and hours (not really). The food here is definitely worth any speedy plate clearance.,1
8554,"Excellent food, amazing service, and Ty made our lunch a dining experience. I'd definitely return. We had the broccoli, the fried manchego cheese, and the pork shoulder.",1
8555,One of the best pork bellies I ever had..,1
8556,"One of my best dining experiences ever was at Purple Pig. Other visits have been great, but didn't live up to the ""first date,"" when I admittedly went way overboard, sat there for a couple hours and sampled several apps, cheese, charcuterie, wine, digestivs and dessert. If you're with someone else, just order tons of things and share. I highly recommend the full-on pig board, where you get to try all the charcuterie laid out on a literal pig-shaped board from nose to tail. Excellent food. Great wine selection. Family-like dining tables. Ask questions. Make friends. Dig in. You'll have a blast. Just expect to wait at least an hour for a seat!",1
8557,"Great food, just wished there was more on the plate for the price you pay. The server was very nice and helpful.",1
8558,"Food and service were FIRE.
Portions on the small side, but flavors on point. Service was impeccable.
Would highly recommend.",1
8559,"So good!  It is how dinner should be everywhere!  Just off Michigan Avenue north of the Chicago River.  Extensive wine list, amazing dishes like raw corn & tomatoes with arugula pesto, milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes that will melt in your mouth, and octopus with summer beans, fingerling potatoes & salsa verde.  Sounds simple however masterfully put together.",1
8560,Great pork shoulder with excellent meshed potato!!,1
8561,"Very nice restaurant, five stars!!!!",1
8562,Amazing food and service but super small and 1.5 hr wait.,1
8563,"We popped in for a quick bite before a show and WOW are we glad we did!! We had two glasses of wine off their extensive wine list - Sangiovese for me, Cava for him. For our pre-show meal we ordered Duck Fat Roasted Almonds with Garlic, a seasonal orange, olive, and fennel salad, and Prosciutto Di Parma.

The food was fantastic and the service was exceptional! If we had stayed in Chicago a day or two longer, we would have made a second visit to the Purple Pig. It was just that good!",1
8564,"Very tasty.  Our second time here.  Thus time we brought our kids, including our foodie son and picky daughter.  Both enjoyed the food and ambiance.  Great time as in the past.",1
8565,Amazing restaurant! It is a must visit if you are travelling to Chicago. The food is unbelievably delicious. It is a symphony of flavors expertly prepared and combined culminating in masterpieces. Five stars all the way.,1
8566,French cuisine that brings you back to the days of proper service and delectable flavors. this is a must do for foodies. The wine list is well thought out and offers fantastic wines by the glass. Can't wait to go back.,1
8567,"Always spot on, now that they're in the bigger location the hours long waits are gone. Jimmy and the entire staff put love into every dish and you can taste that in every bite.",1
8568,"Interesting dishes, the wait was long but they have a great system of notifying when the seat is available.

Really enjoyed the asparagus & egg dish, as well as the pork shoulder.",1
8569,Chicago is known for it’s great food. Kind of the melting pot of American fare. This place is a fantastic representation of small plates and amazing pairings. If I lived in Chicago you can bet I would take dates here.,1
8570,"A friend recommended this place for the duck confit - he was right, the duck confit was delicious. Also had a couple of cocktails and they were good too. The restaurant was pretty full during dinner on that one weekend I was visiting but I was able to grab a seat at the bar. The staff was friendly.",1
8571,"Eating bone marrow sounds gross, but this place makes it amazing! Second time back in two years, I will keep coming here every time I come to Chicago.

People who don't like communal tables probably like to sit and instagram their food all night and look at facebook. We made friends with everyone at our tables and ended up sharing all of our food. Great way to try out most of the menu!",1
8572,"Better stock up folks your really gong to appreciate the food ambiance and perfection everyone here attends to when your able to return.  Good  luck all while down, hopefully a delivery or carry out system can be implemented during this crazy, train ride we are all on.  Drive up on the Mag Mile!",1
8573,Crowded seating. You sit next to strangers at same table. Roasted bone marrow dish was good but not worth ordering again. You're basically spreading fatty bone tissue on bread. Fried olives were tasty. Osso Bucco was delicious and a bigger dish. I'd order again. Everything seemed reasonably priced for being off of Michigan ave. I'd try again.,1
8574,"This is top notch food such as glazed duck, Turkey legs, ramen the root and other ritzy dishes.

It's a little $$ but worth it.
The wine is excellent.!!
The service even better.!!",1
8575,"I'm in Chicago monthly; I went here my first time the previous trip and enjoyed it so much was back there again last week. Good location for the solo business traveler - fairly easy for a single to score a counter seat and the whole atmosphere generates a friendly environment. Food, wine selection, beer selection, atmosphere, location and music - excellent. Service - good.",1
8576,No reservations are taken. Call ahead of time to see how long the wait is and was told 45 minutes. Asked where to park and was given the directions to a $50 garage. Get there from driving over an hour from the burbs and was told it was over a 2 and a half hour wait. Just blown away by the wait and left. Went back the following weekend and had to wait an hour and finally got sat. Food menu is a bit strange and service was slow. Very overrated.,0
8577,"The menu has a lot of items that I found a bit weird but I was able to find some dishes that I was comfortable with and they were really delicious: Huevos Rotos con Chorizo ,  Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder ,  another sausage dish and a shrimp dish. But then there was a dessert to die for. The waiter described it as a doughnut and a cannoli had a baby, which was pretty accurate. It was this huge deep fried pastry served hot with liquid cannoli filling in it.

Unfortunately, our waiter was not all that attentive.",1
8578,"The most delicious food I’ve had in a long time! Order to share as many plates as people in the table, we loved the Eggplants, Fetta, Beets, Jamón Serrano, Chorizo. Works for vegetarians and not. Brian is outstanding!
P.S. please open one in LA !!!",1
8579,"My favorite restaurant in Chicago! If you are visiting the city and don't visit this restaurant you are missing a very good restaurant!
Edit: Last month I went twice to the Purple Pig and I must say that even though I still love the restaurant, the menu has changed dramatically. I like that the restaurant changes their menu often to not stick with the same options always but the new menu is too meaty and there´s few vegetable options available now. People might love this but I prefer a balance between meats and vegetables which is why I liked this reaturant so much.
Side note: please bring back the beets old recipe. The new one is not as good as the old one.",1
8580,Truly a one of a kind.  Order a plate at a time and experience everything you can.  Highly recommend the salt roasted beets if you are a beet fan and the bone marrow is always worth a try.,1
8581,"Terrible customer service and and awful seating policy. We turned up as a group of 3 (our 4th person was 15 minutes behind us). The woman at the front told us she had tables of 4 but wouldn't seat us until our last person arrived. She told us to wait in a tiny space by the toilets where we were right in the way of people waiting for the restroom and serving staff. One of my party was also heavily pregnant and starting to feel uncomfortable being bumped into constantly. No one made any allowances for her. After 15 minutes of standing cramped in a corner our other person arrived. On returning to the front desk the same woman said ""it's a wait of an hour"". When we tried to remind her that we'd already been waiting she just ignored us and carried on with the next customer so we were forced to leave. Worst experience in a restaurant in a long time. I've been here before and the food is good but the attitude of the staff and the ad hoc inconsiderate way they run their seating system is not acceptable especially when we were only one person short and had a pregnant woman with us who needed to eat and sit down! Unacceptable.",0
8582,Excellent food. Be prepared to wait though. We were lucky and were seated quickly but others waited for a while. The bone marrow is amazing and so is the octopus.,1
8583,"Been there a few times, it used to be very good but it seems the restaurant is resting on its laurels. The menu hasn't changed much, but it seems to be getting incrementally more expensive every time I go. It is worth a visit for a tourist in the loop looking for a meal, but doesn't stand up to repeat visits.",1
8584,Everything I ate here was absolutely delicious. The menu features many parts of the pig that I would never consider eating are showcased front and center; the unique dining experience was exceptional.,1
8585,"Friendly and knowledgeable staff, with great menu selections and a bar. I went there looking for a gluten-free lunch and was not disappointed! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. I will definitely be going here again.",1
8586,"I walked in and they wouldn’t seat me without my children. I told them that I would order the food for all of us. They were not busy at all. It was after lunch and many tables available. They seated me. I waited for someone to serve me for about 10 minutes. I asked where the restroom was, hostesses pointed it out. I came back and bus boy was already clearing my table. I didn’t say anything. I just left.",0
8587,"Great service, delicious food",1
8588,"The ribs were perfect, not too impressed by the smears",1
8589,"Stopped by on a Monday night around 9:30pm...still crowded, but we were seated immediately at a large table shared with other diners.

The food was amazing! Ingredients are fresh and full of flavor...we tried about six different dishes, including the ""JLT"" (Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg), Mussels (with Pancetta, Crème Fraîche & Marjoram), and Wagyu Sirloin Tip (with Fingerling Potatoes, Cippolini Onions, Olives & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette). Everything was fantastic!

Keep in mind portions are purposefully small, so each person will need 2-4 items to make for a solid meal. Pricing is about average for a tapas-style restaurant. Service was prompt and friendly.

I love trying new restaurants, but next time I come back to Chicago, I may have to have a repeat session at Purple Pig...it's that good!",1
8590,"Phenomenal! One of my favorite restuarants in chicago. A bit small but they have great long tables and a fantastic wine list. If you like pig this the place to go! Check out the Neck bone gravy, bone marrow spread, and the mussels!",1
8591,"It was a pretty Good Experience, the servers were Good, excellent smiles, they seem to really like their job but the food looked better in the pictures, when I tried tasting the food it was rather bland, so I tried to talk to them and they were cooperative and I was able to replace it with a better food. Place is a little too crowded.",1
8592,Food was delicious. Prices were great. The service was knowledgeable and most importantly warm. It was packed and the wait was high but you can mark them down for being popular.,1
8593,Everything is awesome. This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Tuna tartare. Get it.,1
8594,"Amazing food and service! Portions are not very large which allows to try a few different things (and ends up costing more since small portions are not all that inexpencive!). So, great place but more pricey.",1
8595,"The wait is long, but it is worth it! They text you when a table is ready, so you can walk on Michigan Ave or grab a drink at a nearby bar until the table is ready. The waiters are so knowledgeable, and the food and wine is magnificent! I will be back again.",1
8596,"If you're looking for food that is unique and an experience for the taste buds, Purple Pig is the place to go. The servers are pleasant and very friendly. Know that Purple Pig has serving sizes to share. Very busy during the lunch and dinner hours.",1
8597,I don’t get it. Expensive small plates that leave you not full in an environment that’s not very hip or unique. Skippable.,0
8598,"Thee pork shoulder simply amazing! You just try it. The service was when we arrived was slow, but our server was very knowledgeable and has great recommendations.",1
8599,"It's worth the wait but you may not like it if you're not a fan of community tables.

Between the two of us we each had 3 dishes that we shared and all were very good. The standouts had to be the fried Petit Basque Cheese which looked like a mozzarella stick but had about 100x the flavor especially when paired with the Membrillo that comes with it.

The Roasted Bone Marrow smear is one of my favorite dishes of all time. I'm not a big gusher unless something really blows my mind but the bone marrow did. It is so rich and flavorful that I wish I could smear it on all my food. It is a must when you go.

I don't really like community tables but once the food came I was in the zone and didn't notice anyway.",1
8600,"Testing on laurels and catering to tourists. Used to have great food at good prices. Food quality has declined and prices have risen. Even the wine menu has emphasized money over quality. Most of the wines by the glass, and we had several, were low quality and over priced. Food was poor too. Caponats had bar b q like sauce in it--bizarre. Chicaron s were doused in some vinegar like substance that made them inedible. The ribs with farro mediocre--go to Smoq. Octopus at $23 is a rip off. Just pass this place by and teach owners a lesson",0
8601,"Outstanding food. Everything I ate was exceptional. Had the eggplant and cheese appetizer, chocolate blackout cake, and an amazing fish. Will come here everytime I go Chicago",1
8602,"A service staff that can equal the incredible food and wine. So many choices and they are ALL great! I just wish we lived closer, but it will be a destination on my next trip.",1
8603,"Great food and service. Spectacular wine selection. Adam was a perfect server. Somewhat crowded, if you require acres of personal space, you may not be able to appreciate the quality.",1
8604,This was one of the best meals I have eaten. Every course was paired to perfection whether it was with wine or the combination of indredients.  Absolutely a wonderful culinary experience. Yummy!,1
8605,"The broccoli was exceptional, a mix of salty anchovy vinegrette and texture from the bread crumbs. The shrimp, muscles and sea bass had a slightly spicy and salty taste that lingered. The toast points were a welcome addition as push up and essential to savor the feta and tomato base.",1
8606,"Very good food, shame about the Chicago prices.",1
8607,"Sat at the chief's counter. Everything in that kitchen reminded of hell's kitchen. The chief will look at the orders coming and bark off the orders the reply would be ""yes chief "". A strong chief that looks at every dish and will not not take imperfect plates out to the dinners. Best table to be seated be seated at is the kitchen area",1
8608,Love every single dish here!,1
8609,"Oh my goodness...cheese, swine, and wine! This place doesn't take reservations but it's well worth the wait because they have some of the most delicious food ever! Try the bone marrow...it's amazing!",1
8610,"It's pretty expensive but it's a fun place with interesting foods. They have somaliers and will fold your napkin for you when you get up, but at the same time it has a very crafty feel to it. Oh, and all of the food we ordered was great!",1
8611,Great service. Quick and cordial. Excellent atmosphere. Food and cheese top quality. Our waiter was so much fun. Good luck with your stand up!,1
8612,"The food was excellent, but the 2 hour wait (though accurately quoted) didn't feel worth the experience given that the service, while attentive, seemed more interested in turning the table vs. ensuring an enjoyable evening.

I will not return.",1
8613,Delicious food and great service,1
8614,"Hands down one of THE best restaurants in Chicago. This is a must if you are a foodie visiting Chicago. Don't let the ""Mediterranean"" style fool you. This place is much more than hummus and chickpeas. The menu is constantly changing, but some of the staples are on the menu year round (Crispy Pigs Ear) and your waiter will be able to make excellent recommendations.

Be prepared for a long wait, but trust me, it's worth it.",1
8615,What an awesome place! I visited this restaurant with my parents when I was in Chicago for winter break. The food was soo yummy. I really liked the pulled pork sandwich and their BBQ ribs. It was pretty noisy that night as the bears where playing Monday night football and our waiter was a lil slow (25 mins just to get our drink order) but overall I'd visit again.,1
8616,Love this place!  We sat at the bar overlooking the chef action.  So efficient and it all looks so fresh and tasty.  Lunch was great.  We're coming back for dinner.,1
8617,"Great and unusual food, for example bone marrow. Fast service, good wines. Don't come here though if you are not a meat lover. And completely full. That's a good sign, as well.",1
8618,"I loved visiting this place! It was inside a building, but the food, customer service and drinks were all top notch. Wonderful place to escape the city for a bit, grab a nice plate of food and meet new people. Good place for conversation as well.",1
8619,"Mediterranean food, so good. it was so tasty. bring your hunger - portions are generous. feels like a place in charlotte that i enjoyed visiting.",1
8620,"Super salty food. Small expensive portions. I was very hungry but couldn't even finish my food.
The tables are set so close to each other people would constantly hit my chair when walking by. Overall, a poor experience.",0
8621,"Beet salad best ever. A must.  Great coppa, cauliflower and chicken thigh kabobs. The most efficiently organized staff I've ever seen. Friendly.",1
8622,"The service was great here, they were able to serve drinks for anyones taste. The food was great, the chicken leg practically melted in your mouth. The noise indoors was very loud and could be distracting. Without a reservation, the wait can be quite extensive.",1
8623,Nothing short of amazing.  Had all vegetable dishes...impeccably prepared.  Worth however long you have to wait.  Looking forward to revisiting in October on my next trip to Chicago.,1
8624,"We stayed across the street at the InterContercontental Hotel on Michigan Avenue. We googled best restaurants near our location. We found this Jem of a tapas(small plate) restaurant so close. We were traveling with hip grammie and poppa, mom and dad and birthday girl (7). We were able to go put our name in to wait for a table, as they do not take reservations, but will take names and numbers and call. If you can make it in 5 minutes you are good. We had such a GREAT experience. We sat outside at a shared table. We are not adventurous people but decided when inRome do as the Romans do! We are so glad we did.
We all had new kinds of European wines and loved them. We shared the Olive Oil-Poached, quail eggs,roasted red pepper &three kids lemon vinaigrette antipasti, the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta smear (kid friendly), Housemade Meatballs with Green Garlic Ricotta Purée & toasted brioche and the specials Naked Pasta with sauce and ricotta sauce inside and Fois Gras pear sauce.  We were WOWed by the service and the quality of the food!
Foodies forever! The Forsberg's from Michigan",1
8625,So fckn delicious!!!,1
8626,"Great food and great service. It’s very crowded because they are so popular. If you don’t have a reservation, you need to get there BEFORE 11:30 when they open, because the line will be LONG.",1
8627,"Excellent food, small plates for sharing. We sat at a community table and were seated outside as soon as we arrived. Braised pork shoulder was outstanding.",1
8628,One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Ordered a number of tapas style share plates - the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta and some bread is delicious! Great cocktail and wine list to boot.,1
8629,"I think they overcharged me on the Cabernet by a few bucks as I looked at the menu later online…also, didn’t like the energy the establishment provided.",0
8630,"Great food and wine, underwhelming service. Server forgot our order and it took well over 45m to come out after we clarified the food. It was delicious when it came out though!",1
8631,Amazing food!!!! THe small plates also are great because you get to try so many different things. The only complaint is that it is very tough to get into with no resverations and lots of tourists. I am ready to go back!,1
8632,"Hmmm. I looked at the menu and it didn't seem appetizing to me-being from SF and all. So I order probably the worst thing on the menu for a place known for pork. I ordered Broccoli. OMG. It was great. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with breadcrumbs. However, what stole the show was my wine. Incredible rosè from Piedmonte region in Italy. I am definitely going back.",1
8633,Marrow is pretty greasy but still worth to try.,0
8634,"Let me start off by saying... be ready to WAIT!  No such thing as immediate seating unless you come here around 4 in the afternoon on a Saturday.  No reservations.

Got here at 5:15pm and the hostess told us it will be a 2.5 to 3 hr wait.  Holy moley!
HOWEVER... we got our seats for 5 ppl in half that time.  I suppose some people didn't want to wait and we then got bumped up on the list. Thank goodness!

As for the food, I must say most of the dishes were different in a very good way!  Their dishes are more like Tapa sizes, so we ordered 10 dishes for 5 ppl.  It filled us up for sure!

Recommendations:
- Half Duck Confit w/ Smoked Trout Roe
- Calamari & Asparagus
- Broccoli w/ Roasted Garlic (Yes, trust me. I don't like veggies, but this is indeed a must try!)
- Pork Belly w/ Citrus Gel
- Roasted Bone Marrow (Still dreaming about this)
- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder
- Fried Pigs Ear w/ Crispy Kale & Fried Egg",1
8635,"My best meal in Chicago, for sure.  I have lived here for 4 years and love new foodie places-- I thought this place was probably touristy or something before I tried it, but I really enjoy the food.  My friends have told me about the Sicilian Iris dessert-- going back to try it.",1
8636,Food is delicious.  Definitely a little on the pricey side. I'm not being cheap but I also cook and know some dishes are a little to out there. It's on Michigan Avenue so expect to spend some money.,1
8637,"This place is amazing. Fantastic food, wine list and our server tonight was super knowledgeable, and very handsome 😊 Will definitely be back next time I'm in town.",1
8638,"Never done tapas style before, took a minute to get used to. Menu is full of things you wouldn’t expect, but food is excellent!  I would definitely go back again, and would recommend it to anyone.",1
8639,wonderful small plates. great variety of food. worth the wait. nice to have indoor and outdoor social seating. wine list affordable by glass. will come back.,1
8640,"Food and service are excellent. They have creative, well-balanced, delicious (and shareable) dishes you won't find anywhere else. It's always the highlight of a trip to Chicago.",1
8641,"Most amazing food place in Chicago!  Excellent dishes and great staff!  There may be a wait to be seated, but that just shows how awesome the food is and well worth the wait!",1
8642,"Gotta love the purple pig!  This is one of our favorite restaurants in Chicago.  The broccoli is really good, and the pork pâté is delicious.   This place is small so seating is limited, better call ahead or come early.",1
8643,The food was to die for. The server was helpful with explaining the menu and recommended some solid options. I ordered the pork shoulder and I highly recommend it. I will come back.,1
8644,"Man what a great experience. I highly recommend the JLT (Pork Jowls), crispy pigs ears with kale, and the octopus. I loved the JLT and the crispy pig ears because of the texture between the crunchiness of the pork and the goeyness of the eggs. This octopus was grilled to perfection (not left tough and chewy like 90% of restaurants that try to tackle with this creature). Loved the food and highly recommended!",1
8645,Excellent location and unique menu makes this place a must visit among trendy crowd. The wine and spirit selection is amazing. Food is tasty and also unique.,1
8646,"Food was great! We asked our server for recommendations, and she offered a great menu of things for the table to share. Highly recommended!",1
8647,"I love it! I love this place. It's casual, friendly, has a great turkey burger & sweet potato fries, parking & next to the Oxbow Public Market if you want a dessert or to do some browsing. Really nice people and nice service.Thank you guys!",1
8648,"The Purple Pig, though clearly a meat house, surprisingly has quite a great selection of vegetarian dishes on the menu that are so incredibly tasty. Plus I just love the location. I can do my shopping up and down Michigan Avenue and then when I get hungry I can grab a bite to eat right along my route.",1
8649,"Never would I have thought I'd eat a gourmet hot dog with a knife and fork, but the savory flavor and unique atmosphere enticed me to do so. As an out of Towner, I definitely recommend stopping by this upbeat establishment.",1
8650,Mediterranean food at this location - great. Nice place to think about business. I've had nothing but enjoyable experiences here and plan to keep visiting. Prices are decent for the quality.,1
8651,This is one of my favorite spots in Chicago - worth the ever-present wait for a table.  I haven't had a bad dish there but my favorite is definitely the bone marrow.  It's a can't miss - along with the extensive wine list.,1
8652,"After all the hype, I enjoyed flirting with Purple Pig's swiney decadence, but I did not fall in love with it.  We had the pork fried almonds - excellent garlic and rosemary flavor, but the longer they sat, the soggier they became.  Next was the corned pork reuben, with it's fatty, gelatinous bits and a pickle-y side of frisee.  Nicely charred bread held it all together.  Following that was the pork tripe, sausage and pork bread crumbs in a tomato based pool of flavor.  Aesthetically, I thought this dish could have used a sprinkle of parsley just to add a touch of green color.  Warm and hearty, it was a good winter dish.

You will have to wait.  We were told 45 minutes for an early Saturday dinner, but it's a fun, energetic atmosphere filled with locals and suburban foodies along with the out of towners in search of a James Beard meal.  The tables are cozy, and we ended up chatting with the couple next to us.

I'll go back with a group to try some more wine, swine and cheese.  It's a bit like having friends over, but you don't have to clean up afterward.",1
8653,"Great food, good portion sizes, fabulous wines and fun ambience, overall we had a great time in a big group. The place is loud though.",1
8654,The best restaurant I have ever been to! Everything you can order is better than heaven for your mouth!!!,1
8655,The food is amazing. The portion sizes are a little small but totally reasonable.,1
8656,"Excellent small plates emphasizing meat, cheeses, and wines.  Only knock is its loud and felt a touch rushed.  But excellent food, would go again.",1
8657,"Best tapas in the Chicagoland area. On a nice day, the outdoor seating along the river offers one of the best views of the loop. Pair that with a side of their Brussels sprouts and you're in for a great dining experience.",1
8658,"Ate here recently with chef's from Windsor, Ontario. Chef Jimmy Bannos Jr. Came out and recommended some dishes and sat with us for a bit. Everything we tried was phenomenal. Vegetables I would have never ordered before are now my favoriite items. Couldn't have eaten better!",1
8659,pricey ok food,0
8660,The bone marrow may be the best thing I've ever tasted. Fun atmosphere with great service.,1
8661,"I tried octopus, opah and poached tuna antipasti and everything would be very tasty, if were't so oversalted. Plus incredibly noisy. Plus we wated milk braised pork shoulder for almost an hour and they brought it only after other people in our company already ate their meal and drank all beer and yes, it was way oversalted too.",0
8662,"This place is amazing! Although you cannot make a reservation here, it is well worth the wait. The fried deviled eggs and turkey leg confit are a must! If your going in either alone or wiht one other person i recommend scavanging for a seat at the bar ,which is fisrt come accomadation. You also get to get served by a lovely bar tender ;)Q",1
8663,Sometimes wait times get long but it is well worth it.  The food is excellent and come in small portions.  It is easy to share with others and for a big group.  I went with a bunch of folks and it was awesome!,1
8664,Fantastic food with creative combinations. Our server gave great recommendations and I’m glad we trusted them as we would’ve ended up with a totally different dinner.,1
8665,Sat at the bar and had great service. Fantastic wine and food suggestions from the bar tender. The sausage here was incredible and the dessert was mind-blowingly good. Great date night place.,1
8666,"Delicious tapas, with an interesting but central location overlooking an underpass.  Can be quite chilly and cramped in the winter in the enclosed patio, but the food was delicious.  Especially recommend the grilled octopus.",1
8667,I love the Purple Pig! There is always a wait so plan accordingly! I usually put my name down and walk across the street to grab a drink while I'm waiting. The food is melt in your mouth delicious! I recommend Purple Pig to everyone!,1
8668,"Absu-freaking delicious.   Creative and tasty, one of a kind restaurant,  ossobucco and duckconfit",1
8669,"It was good but not close to my expectations, the octopus is a must the lamb was average good and the price are high",1
8670,"Amazing food and service. We were seated at the kitchen ""bar"" where we watched the chefs in action. Great passion for what they do and you can taste it in every bite",1
8671,"Food is overpriced and quite average, definitely doesn't warrant the high prices. Seems to appeal to tourists more than local residents.",1
8672,Melt in your mouth meats and great drinks.  Warm atmosphere that caters to both the well dressed and the casual.,1
8673,Very good food & service. The Bacon Wrapped Shrimp were amazing as was the Tuna.,1
8674,Simply my favorite tapas restaurant in the country.  I travel to Chicago 4-5 times per year.. Always impressed with the food and Liz Martinez's wine list.  Besy value and depth in Chicago..,1
8675,Was recommended by friend. Packed and crowded. Foods were delicious but they were in small portion so plan well. Do not take reservation so we went to Nacy Pier after putting our name. Not a cheap place to eat.,1
8676,"Specialized in pork dishes! Ordered the platter, broccoli, pork shoulder and loved them all! Except for bone marrow which is basically fat and doesn't have any taste on it's own.",1
8677,"Very good food, with a few brilliant bites, too.  Very satisfying.  Casual but still quality.  I especially liked the Oranges and Olives dish.",1
8678,"“Always Top Notch Food and Service”
As New Englanders who occasionally visit Chicago, we always visit Joe's for the all around good food and good service at reasonable prices. You can't go wrong with the jumbo lump crabcakes. The side dishes are generous and are meant to be shared. The creamed spinach and sweet potato with pecan butter are delectable. The meal is preceded by a...",1
8679,"Great food! Every single dish is great and thought through! Loved the bone marrow and the pig ears most! Friendly and professional staff, too!",1
8680,A warm and cozy atmosphere provides an unique sensation to try one of the most elegant kitchen in Chicago.  Spanish octopus from the grill was superb,1
8681,"They do NOT take reservations! Do yourself a favor and just sit at the bar!

Yes, it's VERY VERY busy. Yes. It's already crowded when it first opens at 11am. If you go in with the attitude that you're going to have a quiet candlelight dinner with a very special someone. It's not going to happen. Surrender to taking your time waiting for seat and people watching. This is a foodie's restaurant where you'll be surrounded by other foodies. Enjoy their company. Compare notes. That's the best way to enjoy the wait and the atmosphere. Do not put yourself on a timeline for this experience (i.e. getting in and getting out within a set time). Otherwise, you'll find yourself frustrated and annoyed and storming out.

Menu Recommendations:
- Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs,Cornichons & Parsley
So delicious! It makes you wonder why cauliflower can't always be this awesome.

- Deviled Egg with Arugula & Capers
I know, I know, it's deviled eggs. But they're really really good and perfect to share!

- Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche}
So famous that the girl from London we sat next made a pilgrimage to Chicago for it!

If you sit at the bar, hope that you get Alan. He's one the best bartenders in the city. He loves his job and knows what he's doing.",1
8682,The food and service was amazing.,1
8683,"Service is very slow, took 40 minutes before the ordered food came.  That was just a regular Thursday afternoon.  The whole restaurant is filled with cooking smoke, the venting in the kitchen was not working at all.  Food tested so so",0
8684,One of the nearby places to go to where you're in the magnificent mile.  They have a lot of wine choices and they open late.  The best thing I ordered from this place is the grilled bone marrow which you can use as a spread to toasted bread.,1
8685,Ok location for tasty Mediterranean food. I give this spot a thumbs up. The staff was friendly and observant. Atmosphere and food reminds me of Virginia Beach.,1
8686,"The drinks were good, but the food quality was poor.  It used to be good, but now the pairings are not working.  It's like they are trying to copy Girl and the Goat with poor quality ingredients.",0
8687,Waited 45 min due to long line but it was worth it. My kids loved all that we ordered including dessert😋😋. Staff were friendly and price wasn’t bad. Will definitely be back😃😃,1
8688,"I went to this restaurant. The server was awful, didn’t give us good advice, seemed arrogant, and also had attitude. We felt by his service that we shouldn’t even have been there. He wears glasses and he’s skinny just incase you get stuck with him. The food on the other hand did not turn out like we expected either. Not a place I would recommend.",0
8689,"Very tasty food. We were left wondering which of the sharable dishes we actually enjoyed the best.

Price for food and beer was decent. The wine glass was overpriced.",1
8690,"I was so hungry trying to find a place open after 10pm and accidentally foud this place. And what a surprise.  The food was fantastic OMG, good flavor,  nice presentation, the waiters super friendly and bilingual, the atmosphere super fun. I will totally come back if I'm in Chicago again.",1
8691,"Great food, great service! A large variety of choices. I ordered stuffed octopus, satisfied with it. Will try more next time.",1
8692,"Delicious, fun, and friendly. I had never been there and wasn't sure about some of the dishes but the staff were all friendly and helpful and the food was to die for!",1
8693,"Overrated, salty, greasy pig place.  Bad, bad, bad.  I have been here twice, and I couldn't figure out why people come to this place.  I had pig ears, pig bone marrow, pig osso bucco, and lots of other pig parts.  I am perfectly fine eating any part of the pig, but this is some really greasy salty pig part that wasn't really cooked well.  I will never come back to this place.  People, please don't line up for like 3 hours to eat here, totally not worth it.",0
8694,Excellent spot in downtown Chicago. For sure pork dishes are the stars of the show. Main showstoppers and must tries are the short ribs and the milk braised pork shoulder,1
8695,"Best food I've had in a long time and a great dining experience.
Tried the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, the Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde, and the Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Endive, & Agrodolce; all of them amazing and cooked perfectly.
The dessert was not that great, but come on, I believe that the word PIG in its name should give you an idea of what this restaurant's ""forte"" is.
The recommended wine, a Vega Sindoa Cabernet from Navarra, Spain was also spot on.
I would definitely pay them another visit and once again honor their name by eating like a pig!",1
8696,One of my absolute favorite places in Chicago. The wait can be exasperating but you can get a glass of beer or wine and wait out in the sunshine during the warmer months. The food itself is incredible. Who knew meatballs could taste so good?,1
8697,"Great food. Can get busy and you're better off if you show up early, but the food is great. You share tables with others, but that's just the style.",1
8698,"We were there on Super Bowl Sunday evening during a snow storm.  Not sure why people kept telling me that I would have a long wait,  we had no problems getting seated right away.
And,  the food was good too.",1
8699,"Awesome experience! Delicious dishes, I loved the squid and the pork belly! The desert was a combination of flavors, amazing.",1
8700,Great food. Can't go wrong with any of the plates. Large selection of wine and a good hot toddy for those cold Chicago days.,1
8701,hey have very distinguished food combination but everything is delicious. We could share great food suggested by the hostess and we were delighted with each dish that was served to us.,1
8702,Amazing and suprising food. Loved the calamari salad. Best I ever had. Best drink was hop scotch. I would return every week if I could!,1
8703,"Excellent food.  Wife loved her salad.  The wait was a bit long, about an hour.  The wait staff was friendly.  My pork shoulder was tender and juicy.",1
8704,"Pig here, Pig there, Pig everywhere......with a side of cheese. Great place! Amazing food and great service. If you love eating meat and like to get creative then this is the place. Drinks are pretty awesome also.",1
8705,"This was a quaint little place set in downtown chicago,
We went here in December and if it's the first time here I'd suggest you to talk to your server who knows what to get.
We decided to get greek yogurt balls i guess, a pork dish which was heavenly and we got polenta which was flavorful to say the least. Foer dessert we got a pana-cota .
Would recommend!
PS: For wine pairing just ask the dude there, wont disappoint!",1
8706,"If you coming to Fort Sam Houston and you're by the PX come to the Purple Pig. The purple hog pulled chicken and pulled pork sandwich with the mix of sweet and hot BBQ sauce is incredible but be forewarned the hot, is hot, not the Wimpy hot you used to, real hot. One of the best meals I've had in a while.",1
8707,"I had good service (early afternoon, midweek) but the food to me was just okay. Maybe I ordered the wrong things. Maybe it was an off day. But as there are so many amazing places to eat in Chicago I can’t see me returning.",1
8708,"Love the place, food was wonderful as usual, charred cauliflower, squid, eggplant, spare ribs were all perfect! Eldiflower drinks, and martinis, everyone was happy and service was perfect!",1
8709,"The most incredible tasting, unique plates. Food comes out fast in small share plates",1
8710,Absolutely delicious! Everything we had here was outstanding! Service was great and gave great recommendations when we asked.  Fun and friendly atmosphere.  We will be back again!,1
8711,"Really interesting food, very good.",1
8712,I am so shocked that they are 4.5 stars restaurant... They are totally overrated. These people probably have never tasted a ‘good food’. Everything was SO SALTY and TOO ACID. I am even feeling sick after dining here. I would never recommend this place to anyone.,0
8713,Excellent meal and service. Mint Gelato was incredible,1
8714,"Loooove this place! If you go, definitely get the bone marrow (even if you think you're not into bone marrow) It was life changing! All of their dishes are good though, so if you're not feeling adventurous, you'll still enjoy!",1
8715,"This is my favourite restaurant here in Chicago. The ambiance is so nice and the service is great. The staff will assist you. Most importantly, the food tastes delicious.",1
8716,Long wait but very worth it! Normally it is an hour wait but they will call you while you shop! You cannot go wrong with anything on their menu.  Everything is amazing! Try the fried pig ears!!,1
8717,"Tapas on the Mag Mile

The Purple Pig has been open since December '09 and is one of the best after work spots on the Mag Mile. Featuring homey-tasting pork shoulder and other appetizers, it is friendly and accesible. The wine list is good too. Go for the family-style tables, so you can meet new friends!",1
8718,"worth the wait which usually yakes much less time than stated. If you dig on swine, meat or bbq, the purple pig is worth a try. though there there are  vegeterian options. From bone marrow bourbon, everything was really tasty.",1
8719,"Everything was spectacular. Excellent fast, friendly service. Amazing (and huge!) gin and tonics, and food I will dream about until the next time I can come back",1
8720,Love this place. Unless you ask to have something cooked per your order like the ribeye medium rare. You get scrutinized and the waiter is no longer a friend.,1
8721,"Great food.  Great location. Great Atmosphere.

*** July 16th dinner between 730 - 830pm sitting at the bar was the worst treatment I've ever received by a bar tender at any establishment in Chicago.***

As usual the place was busy, but not crazy busy like some of the other nights I've been there.  I strolled up to the bar to order a drink for my girlfriend and I as the wait for the table as usual is roughly 2 hours.  So as most Purple Pig patron we usually order a drink and wait for a spot to open up at the bar to grab a seat and eat.

As I approached the bar the Bar Tender (the rudest, raciest, egotistic sh## Head) abruptly tells me that i need to order my drink from one of the other servers.  I don't know if the way I looked or something about me ticked this guy off as he was serving other patron who were standing beside me with all the libations that they desired.  I noticed that all of them were white and I was not.  I'm a pretty easy going guy and my girl friend is white and within a couple of minutes my girlfriend found a seat at the bar and nudged me over as the folks right next to her were about to leave and I was going to grab one of their seats.  We had still not ordered our drinks.

My girlfriend called the bar tender over and I asked if he could recommend a Pilsner.  Instead of getting a recommendation from him he rudely tells me to look at page 9 of their drink menu that he placed in front of me and abruptly walks away.  The patrons next to me and my girlfriend are in total shock to the bar tenders aggressive demeanor and tone of voice.  If I wanted to read the menu I would have done so and if he did not want to recommend a drink or beer, he could have politely said so  rather than giving me ""I hate serving you"" look and tone.  By this time I was starting to feel tense.  And I'm a pretty chilled guy.

We placed the order from our drinks and looked over the food menu and were ready to place the order for our food so we called Mr. Vigorous over to take our order.  He looked at my girlfriend and look at me and said ""he's gonna eat to"".  ""How"".  My girlfriend says ""he'll stand""  I was fuming by now.  Because this was getting to be very personal.  His demeanor, tone of voice and his questioning about my ability to eat standing up or sitting down was totally unwarranted and uncalled for.

The food was is and has always been good at the Purple Pig but I felt that the tone and position of the bar tender last night was based on the color of my skin and nothing else.  Its a shame the the ""Purple Pig"" has to hire ""Racist Pigs"" to serve.  Its an absolute shame.",0
8722,Delicious food with a very unique presentation,1
8723,Fantastic food for a reasonable price. Extremely lively. Great customer service - very attentive and helpful. Food is complex and bold; all around delicious.,1
8724,"Great food, Great Ambiance, A Great Place to go for dinner downtown. Beware we waited 1 hr to be seated as this place gets packed! I suggest to make a reservation, if they take them.",1
8725,"Fantastic food, had the shoulder and Brussels sprouts. Service was fast and friendly. It was crowded and medium loud but neither enough to ruin the experience or food.",1
8726,"The food is always fantastic. The service is always amazing, and the wine is always flowing. Don't be afraid to step outside of your confront zone and try something you wouldn't normally eat..",1
8727,"Great accidental find. Food came out quickly and in the right sequence. Had 3 plates for 2: olive poached tuna, house made parpadelle and turkey leg confit. Particularly liked the first 2 dishes, confit was a little too salty for me.",1
8728,On a trip in from New Jersey to Chicago for the weekend and this was my birthday lunch/dinner. Couldnt have been happier. Great sized plates.  Great deal for your money. Great service. And them the food.,1
8729,"Good and unique food, with great wine! Servers are knowledgeable and nice. Quick service, but small place so might have to wait a while for a seat but worth it!",1
8730,Its alright. I think its overrated in terms of food. The service and atmosphere is very lovely but I think its hit with the touristy reviews who don't  know real good food in Chicago.,1
8731,Phenomenal! Their chefs make beets taste like a delicacy. Enough said. :) Get here early because there is always a wait and limited seating.,1
8732,"Best tapas in Chicago! The duck was perfect. They do not take reservations so you will probably have to wait, but it is SO worth it. Get your name in early.",1
8733,"A foodies dream. Interesting small plates, well timed and interesting combinations. The wait staff was friendly and helpful in navigating the menu. I highly recommend this place.",1
8734,Turkey and beets were highlights.   Being told that we weren't getting our table until the 4th of our party was in the building was a lowlight ... this while the three of us were already drinking some pretty pricey albeit tasty cocktails.,1
8735,This restaurant is the best I've been to in Chicago. The flavors blend well on each menu item and everything is fresh. Must get the Sicilian Iris when visiting here!,1
8736,Perfect dining experience. Food was fantastic.,1
8737,Wonderful food. Vegetarians are welcome! One or two plates for liberal vegans.. my brother loved the pork belly!!!,1
8738,"Absolutely unreal flavors in all 5 dishes we tried, highlighted by the Pork Shoulder and Ham Croquettes. Highly recommend",1
8739,The food is excellent and the atmosphere is fairly casual. Love the variety in the menu. A real gem.,1
8740,AMAZING!! Food and atmosphere are both amazing and the staff was top notch. Thank you to Nick for making our experience unforgettable.,1
8741,"Incredible menu.  Food and pairings I would never have thought of.  But, they were great.  Loved the food.  Wonderful service. Playful ambience.",1
8742,"I am Peruvian and visit Peruvian restaurants wherever I travel. This one was quite a surprise. Every single dish was great. I wish I had stayed longer in Chicago to go back at least two more times. One suggestion: the meat anticuchos. Holy cow, literally.",1
8743,"Went twice to this place. Grab light lunch and late night wine and cheese.
Great selection and great preparation. Waiters were both super friendly and of good advice.",1
8744,"Bone marrow?? Never heard of this until I visited the Purple Pig..any other food in the menu is as good!! Cool atmosphere too, will visit again for sure!",1
8745,"Food was good, and service friendly. They fixed some vegan dishes for me upon request. A little crowded and noisy.",1
8746,Purple pig is everything they say it is. Good was amazing and the ambiance was perfect even for a small space. But they are moving next door so it should get bigger. Even though there are no reservations we didn't wait long.,1
8747,Great place with great wine. Definitely a must if you are in Chicago. The service was perfect they hit the spot on every single aspect of the dining experience.,1
8748,"No words necessary.  Amazing bartenders that take their art seriously.  And of course amazing food, that’s why it’s an hour wait until their closed everyday.

They don’t take reservations btw.",1
8749,"Worth trying once to say you went there. It has a really cool ambiance, but the prices are very high for the dish you receive. That’s what you pay for eating on Michigan Ave",1
8750,"This place is always packed, especially in the summer, no reservations available, and your wait time can up to 90 minutes.. I wonder who ever really did that, we went somewhere else then they called us for an available table. Finally tried it on July 3, it was good, not that spectacular to my opinion, but its a fun place.",1
8751,"Awesome food and cozy setting. Good place for a special event. They don't take reservations, so you need to plan accordingly.",1
8752,Very good food super fast service if you can wait long time to get a table or even to seat at the bar. Inventive Mediterranean style food with modern twist and they get the taste just right.,1
8753,What a unique experience. Had a hard time choosing what to eat. There were 4 of us. Everything was so good! Great service too!,1
8754,"Only one word can describe The Pig - AMAZING. The new location seems cavernous compared to the old but we loved the ambiance of the old. Other than that, everything else is still in place. Loved it!",1
8755,"Love the small plates at this small restaurant.  Hard to get in because they don't take reservations, but recommend going during lunch and sitting at the bar. The staff is fantastic and friendly.",1
8756,First time visiting the Purple Pig on my first trip to Chicago. Service was exceptional and the food was absolutely great! This was definitely a highlight of a great holiday weekend.,1
8757,"I highly recommend this Mediterranean-style restaurant. Small plates mainly, but they will not disappoint. Prices are affordable, and it's an outstanding deal for the quality of food. Try the turkey leg.",1
8758,"oh so different!  lots of fun and interesting food!  We always have a great time when we stop off of Michigan Ave and stop to have a great lunch or dinner.  They have a great sherry selection, dry to sweet.",1
8759,"Nice vibe, very busy, quick service and great customer service, but no WOW factor.  Ham croquettes were great, pork  steak was just ok, and pig ears were   disappointing.",0
8760,"This is a cool place, nice vibe. The dinner rolls are much better than expected with butter. I ordered the medium rare prime ribs which is good. However, the median sirloin my friend ordered was too salty & hard to chew. I would recommend the ribeye. I also like the combo appetizer. Would go again when I want to eat steak, the price is fair.",1
8761,"The place was hopping as usual. 45min wait in our car until table was ready, but I'd rather be outside anyway. Host and staff were friendly and the owner was there as well who said to let him know if we need anything. That was pretty impressive.  Waitress was on point with everything from drinks/refills to meals and check. Food was well prepared and there was no shortage of their ""endless rolls"". I'm a big fan of cleanliness so I felt a deduction was warranted here. Table was sticky which often means a dirty towel was used to wipe down. Silverware had soap spots as well, but waitress brought out a fresh set. I will definitely eat here again. Overall it was a good experience and well run establishment.",1
8762,Great experience even though steak was a bit overcooked. Manager made it right & brought out a perfect steak. Lance is a gr8 server. No complaints here!,1
8763,"This was such a good choice. The food is not only delicious but its extremely filling as well. Only had to wait about 7 minutes for the food too! Great service. I definitely recommend this, especially for celebrations.",1
8764,The food n drink were awesome. The employee were very nice n made sure we had everything we needed.,1
8765,"This was the worst experience I have ever had.
My long-awaited steak was ordered incorrectly, they served me sirloin and said Ribeye.
After my friends finished their dinner, the manager served my new overcooked food without saying sorry.
What I was expected was a sincere apology from the manager. However, I feel like he just considered me as a bad consumer. He was super unprofessional and he made me feel bad. I was not in the mood to eat anymore and I left.
Managers should conduct themselves in a professional manner that reflects the attitude of the establishment they are working in. People can make mistakes, but his attitude was unprofessional and unacceptable. Is it that difficult to admit your mistakes?

If you neglect this feedback, it will be fine. I am not a fan of Texas Roadhouse anymore.

The photo shows that I didn't get my food (lower right corner).",0
8766,"Great portions, easy sitting and tasty food. Great customer care, Aby our host gave us a great taste of Texas",1
8767,"I wasn't sure if I liked their check-in solution.  It seemed a bit much at first,  but it actually worked better than I thought.  It kept the people waiting for seats to a minimum and it sure made the wait time less.  We were there shortly after they opened,  so don't know if the wait time got longer later.  It was pretty busy while we were there.  Our waitress was excellent.  The pace of our meal was great. I had chicken fried steak meal from the early bird menu. Husband had 6 ounce sirloin with baked potato and broccoli. Had plenty of bread brought to us.  All food was hot and cooked to our specifications.  Love the atmosphere.",1
8768,Love it! Would like to go again:) good service and best steak house in town,1
8769,Service was great. We got in very quickly. Place is very kept up and clean. Waitress was very polite. Checked on us often. We got our food served accordingly and very pleased.  Though server said no rush. It did feel We were rushed. Probably because we weren't drinking. Which I've noticed at any restaurant that serves alcohol. So it's expected. Overall very satisfied. Plus great parking no matter where you have to park. Easy to get in and out of. Great location as well,1
8770,Our reservation was mixed up for a party of 12. Manager cleared two tables for us so we could all sit together and not have to wait an hour and a half for one big table to open! Food was delicious. Our server was phenomenal with us having six little crazy kids. They sang our daughter happy birthday! 10 out of 10 recommend!,1
8771,"Been here several times and every time, the food and service has been fantastic. The steak is always cooked well and the sides are good as well such as the chili and loaded potato. Their quality is better than some other steakhouses I've been to because the presentation looks great so I can tell they put effort in their food.",1
8772,"We had a table of 7 on a super busy Saturday night. Our server, Jessica, took great care of us. She remembered all our drink orders and all the food was perfect too. She asked questions and made sure to get things right and take care of us. All the food was hot and tasty, very well run restaurant! Thank you!",1
8773,"Excellent dining experience!!!  Friendly and informed wait staff... Had not been here in years and the food was just as good, if not better than the last time!!!  Wife had the ""Portabella Mushroom Chicken"" and I had one of my favorites, the ""Melt in Your Mouth"" Ribs...and yes they did, with just the right amount of char for texture!!! Cesar Salad had the correct amount of dressing and topping and was a perfect start to the meal.  If you haven't tasted the ""Loaded Sweet Potato"", you are missing out (visions of Thanksgiving come to mind).  And last, always ask for more ""Hot Rolls"", I think they add something addictive to the butter that makes you want more!!!
Perfect meal with my beautiful wife!!!",1
8774,Had dinner with my son. It was my first time to TRH. Service was excellent and we loved our waitress Hannah who was attentive to our needs and checked on us multiple times. The manager also. Stopped by to make sure everything was up to our order. I enjoyed the ribeye steak which was cooked as requested. The Margarita was very nice. I will definitely be back soon for the excellent service. Even my 12 year old son was impressed with the service.,1
8775,I have always enjoyed the food at Texas Roadhouse.  I was frustrated when I wanted to bring a larger group from work to dinner.  The limitation on no reservations applies to larger groups as well.  Additionally they won't move  tables to have a larger group seated together.  While I like Texas Roadhouse I advise anyone with a larger group to go elsewhere as their policies are not accommodating to the coordination of a group dinner.  Also if you get seated and more people arrive (even if you have space at table) they will not be seated with you.  In all a good restaurant geared towards smaller groups.  I think the biggest table they have can seat 6 or 7 together.,1
8776,"The absolute best food with the best waiters, so genuine and caring over their customers. If you get the opportunity to meet Katie give her an extra tip, she absolutely deserves it, she goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience.",1
8777,"9 months pregnant all I wanted was a well cooked steak to prevent any blood borne pathogens/parasites to my unborn child. First time getting served steak was overly pink. Watched my husband eat his food while me and my daughter starved. Food got sent back & they brought me my steak back smaller, with pink still. Tried to insult my intelligence by flashing a phone light on the steak. Trying to tell me it was cooked… It still contained pink juice which is unsuitable for my unborn child. Husbands steak was cooked perfect the first time. Very disappointed. Have a Texas Roadhouse in Janesville Wisconsin where I’m from. Never had an issue. 1/5 star. Would rate zero if applicable.",0
8778,"Such a great meal! Food was delicious, service was excellent! Shout out to Timeka, our waitress! Absolutely great, had our drinks refilled without realizing we even needed more to drink! She was super busy, and managed to take great care of us! 😊",1
8779,"I like Texas Roadhouse a lot, but this location consistently gets our orders incorrect for take out. From missing items to steaks not being cooked properly leaves a rating of 3 from my perspective, of their quality of service.

Although our money has been credited several times for those missing items, most recently the steaks have been dry and underwhelming due to the lack of seasoning.

I am unsure if this location is suffering in food quality and (takeout order) negligence due to being under staffed or busy, but I have no plans in utilizing their services in the near future. It’s really disappointing!",1
8780,Awesome experience! Despite it being super busy Jessica was a top notch waitress- very impressive. The food was perfectly cooked as well. 10/10 recommend,1
8781,"Paige, our server was great!! The food was OK. The music was too loud.
I asked to have the music turned down a notch or 2 so my friends and I could hear each other. This establishment isn't a bar but I couldn't tell by the volume.",0
8782,The food is amazing. I love their Barbeque chicken the most. Portions are good and most of the time I bring leftovers home. Very friendly staff that was very helpful accommodating me in my wheelchair.,1
8783,"Oh Wow, we had the best waiter  in the world, So helpfully friendly, fast the best.. Lots of food, delicious, steak perfect, rolls so good. Sides dishes delicious, had to take home.",1
8784,"This place was amazing!

Me and my mother went out on her big 5 0 birthday and we stopped her for dinner, when we got there is was busy, but the wait time was next to nothing, we got seated almost immediately. When our server came by she was amazing (Morgan/ Megan belive her name was) . She was so just awesome and made the experience that much better, I was able to slipp in and tell her it was my mom's birthday and she did not fail in delivering an amazing gift ( the birthday saddle and icecream)

Food was amazing, right along with the over all experience was just amazing, will most definitely be going back for my birthday",1
8785,"Manager on 10/03/2022 @ 1200noon. We called ahead for party of 10, we were seated by server. Manager came over after 10 minutes and told us to squeeze 6 of our party into a booth. We told him there was not enough room. He said others have done it before. He was very rude, so our party of 10 left and went to Outback Steak house where we were treated with respect and had plenty of room. Will not be back to Champaign Texas road house.",0
8786,"Texas Roadhouse is my favorite place to get Prime Rib, problem is, they never have it anymore. Everytime I attempt to use one of my Gift Cards there's a notation across the photo of the Prime Rib that states ""Unavailable At This Time"". I sent a message asking if they were still caring the Prim Ribs and if so, on what days, I never received a reply.",1
8787,"Went to Texas Roadhouse in Champaign Illinois and was told that the wait would be about 15-20 minutes. (Which was fine.) Anyways, when we went to sit down, the man at the front told us that we couldn’t sit in the main area (even though there weren’t people sitting there) because it’s there policy. He told us that are two options were to stand outside, (in the heat) or to sit in our vehicle. It would have been understandable if that place was packed, but it wasn’t. Making people sit in there vehicles or to stand outside is ridiculous, especially when no one is sitting in the main area.",0
8788,"One of the best Texas Road House we been to. Super fast friendly service, even tho it was PACKED! Food was delicious. Service was top notch",1
8789,"While I do enjoy the food service and check in is left to be desired, first time we came in to eat was told 25-40 minute wait . I understand that busy times are somewhat longer but over and hour wait we finally get a table and service was subpar at best. So decided to try again last night hey every place has a bad night figured after 630  not to busy , pulled in nooone at little shack so we go inside . Was told 15-25 minute wait with hardly any cars in lot ,ok ill wait its not to long ,after giving all the information phone ,name and the two people in the party was told have to wait outside or in our car ,so we wait after 50 minutes no call or anything. We left and ate at another establishment I will never be returing to texas roadhouse in champaign.",0
8790,Always really friendly people that work their. Food cooked to perfection. And a great value as well.,1
8791,"We was in there today October 2,2022 we tried calling in to make a call ahead seating for ten people nobody would answer the phone got there they asked how many we said Ten. The manager came out said they had two tables ready we said ok then he ask if all are party was there we said Six of us was the others would be there shortly he told us he could not seat us until all the party was there we told him we wanted to get the tables get drinks and order appetizers he told us no we couldn’t do that so we waited for the others when they seated us they wanted 6 full size adults to sit in a booth they wouldn’t let us sit anywhere else they keep telling us they don’t have enough staff so we got up and left the managers were really rude and didn’t care if we got up and left  I would never eat there again and would advise nobody else to eat there.",0
8792,"Wow! First time visiting and it was awesome. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable.

My husband had a riibeye and it was cooked to perfection! I had the grilled shrimp and they were phenomenal!!

This was an awesome experience and we will be back.",1
8793,Everything was great and wonderful our sever was the absolute best tall skinny girl with blondish brown hair forgot her name wish I remembered because she is what makes customer service great,1
8794,"Food was massively over cooked, even charcoaled, after finishing eating I went to the bathroom and watched a chief use the restroom then just rinse his hands for literally 1 second no soap no scrub and walk out to the kitchen.

This was reported to a member of the waitress staff hopefully she told someone.",0
8795,Nice food. Cool vibe. Would visit again! Tried the steak kabobs and cheese burgers. Both were quite good. Prices are reasonable.,1
8796,I asked for well done Blackened Salmon 8 once.. the fish was super undercooked and till cool on the inside.. so they tried it again.. still not done and definitely it well done as requested.. the management and waitress was ok but the food was not!! At the end before I could pay for my service the waitress was switched out but still here..,0
8797,Logan was super friendly and the service was great. Great work on the team here. You can see how hard all the team members are working in this restaurant to make it happen. Especially post covid and they're all playing a part. This restaurant never disappoints and they always deliver.  Call ahead to make a reservation that way you don't have to wait in a super long line.,1
8798,"We were taken to our table where the host placed our bread and plates down on an unclean table. The floor below was a mess. We were literally standing in food debris and the seats still had smashed food and paper lying on it. I was very disappointed with this staff this day, because when we moved our bread basket and plates to the next table that was clean and clearly no one sitting there. I was told that the table was for someone else, so the waitress grabbed our bread basket and plate’s and placed them back on the uncleaned table. The waitress then said someone will come to clean the tables and floors. She then just walked away without the courtesy of saying “I’m sorry”. I haven’t frequent this restaurant lately due to the last past service I had. Which was not that great then. Perhaps my expectations is too high for this establishment or this is a one off situation. Either case, I will not be coming back. It’s unfortunate, because my son loves the food. Come here at your own risk and low expectations and you will be just fine. Good Luck!",0
8799,"Although the kitchen sent me a well done filet instead of my ordered medium rare filet... our waitress & the manager really made us all feel welcome with great attitudes & fixing my order promptly!!!  I wish I recalled her name, MY waitress... I will DEFINITELY ask for her area next time!!!  But I'm very confident that I would receive the same excellent treatment in any of the other dining  area's!!!  Thank You TR!!!",1
8800,The service and food were great! Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. We did not have to ask him for anything because he was on top of it all. The food was hot and delicious. The portion sizes were large. No one at the table was able to eat all their food. I would definitely recommend going here.,1
8801,"We made a quick stop here on our way home during a road trip. Even with some Covid restrictions in place, we were able to get right in and have food in front of us in 20mins! Friendly staff and good service :)",1
8802,Excellent food.  Good service.  Good prices. Literally some of the best rib eyes I've ever had.  Restrooms clean as well as the overall restaurant itself.,1
8803,"First time at this location.
To Mattie, our server...You were fantastic!! Thank you for being genuinely friendly to us & for taking care of our needs without being asked! We appreciate you!!
As for the food...It was fantastic as well!! My hat's off to the Chefs! My steak was nice and pink, tender & juicy, not overly seasoned, just the way I like it. The sweet potato was Perfect! Omgoodness! It was Hard to save room for dinner though because the Fresh, hot rolls with sweet cinnamon butter are served before your meal & are Extremely addictive!! We'll definitely be back, as this location is also very clean. I even saw them sanitizing the menus between patrons. All around GREAT experience! Thank you! (wish I'd taken photos; but, I was ""in the moment"" for once)",1
8804,We have never had a bad meal or experience at Texas Roadhouse. Love their complimentary rolls with the Cinnamon butter and the cold salad plates.,1
8805,"Great place, great food, and our server Anna did a fantastic job celebrated my daughter's 8th birthday oh, and Anna did an amazing job giving her one of her best moments of her birthday",1
8806,"Wonderful experience! We had Mia on the 4th of July and she was amazing! Service was top-notch, and the food was delicious!",1
8807,"Had steak and baked potato. Food was great! Had a Hurricane Margarita with kicker, it was delicious! Staff was friendly.",1
8808,"I don't find their food to be of quality. The atmosphere is nice, and the service is quick. They always seem to have plenty of staff.",1
8809,"The staff was very friendly and helpful as we had two small ones with us.

We used call ahead seating and our wait was only about 20mins on a Friday night so that was pretty great.

We got the kabobs as well as the roadkill dinner.  The kids menu was reasonable and came with alot of food.

We will go back again as this location has great service and the food quality is wonderful.",1
8810,"My mom loves their ribeye and sirloin steaks. I think their steaks are good, but I always fill up on the bread because it's the best. It's a little too loud and too crowded for comfort sometimes. And we occasionally have to wait quite awhile for a wheelchair-accessible table to become available. But those rolls though. 😁",1
8811,I've been there numerous times and I have never gotten a bad steak there yet very good place to go and eat,1
8812,Food was good. They were very busy so we sat at the bar. The bartender was awesome,1
8813,They need to have tables large enough for more than 6 people and get rid of the booth in the parking lot and you don't need 10 parking spots for carry out,1
8814,"This place is great! Service was friendly, the food was hot and delicious! Fun, casual atmosphere. Will look forward to returning soon.",1
8815,The steak salad was perfect no complaints!,1
8816,"The rolls are good, but the rest of the food quality seems to have gone downhill a bit. The weird parking they have now isn't labeled very well and gets confusing. They are trying to accommodate curbside pickup, but it seems to cause confusion when parking. We had an hour wait, so you better try to make reservations if you can. Staff was very nice",1
8817,"Absolute exceptional service. Completely blown away. Traveling for work and visiting similar restaurants out here, it's been miserable.  Coming to this restaurant and receiving great customer service, great food, and great atmosphere was such a relief. Keep up the great work!",1
8818,As always great food. Don't go Fridays though. Too busy,1
8819,Ariel was an outstanding waitress. Best experience we have had waitress wise. She brought drinks before we needed them and things were brought out in a timely manner. Steaks were cooked to perfection 2 mediums and one medium well.,1
8820,"Food was pretty good. Our server was great, I wish I remembered her name! Only complaint, rolls seemed a little stale, which is very unusual. But we still love Texas Roadhouse!",1
8821,"Service is always excellent. Good food, great prices!",1
8822,I have nothing bad to say about this place. Everytime I come here I walk out happy and full with a to go container. The food here is exceptional.,1
8823,Super busy but service (Kudos Amer!) was attentive and professional food was totes nomz!,1
8824,The food was terrible my steak was overcooked the ribs or burnt the only thing good was the roles and the big potato there were six people in our party and everybody was very unhappy with their food I will never go back there again,0
8825,This is my go-to location for steaks in Chambana. They taste great and are always cooked perfectly.,1
8826,Food has always been great. Also very reasonable priced.,1
8827,Not the same as pre pandemic steak was super thin and had more salt than my margaritas so disappointed .My lunch was 50.00 for a salad 12oz steak and potato and 2 margaritas going to havta find new spot,0
8828,This was my first time. The food was great! The wait staff was so friendly and helpful.,1
8829,This has always been a favorite of my families but since they aren’t able to seat more then 6 at a table anymore and can’t guarantee 2 tables next to each other my family of 7 have taken our business to outback.,1
8830,Good...had a wait...all the benches inside were empty n when we sat down to wait they told we would have to go outside n wait that all the benches were reserved for another group that was not even there yet... wth..would have given 5 stars but....,1
8831,The food is usually pretty good. The service was great and the wait time was long but we went on graduation weekend so that was our bad.,1
8832,"The service is great. They refill your glass without you even telling them. There is alway somebody having a birthday dinner and the staff would sing birthday song together. Very welcoming atmosphere. The bread is Phenomenal! First time I went there, I got full even before my steak was served. But because it’s free, it is actually tasty! The steak is fine. Doneness is always a problem whatever you order. I ordered a medium 12 oz ribeye a couple of time and ended up getting medium well. At least that is consistent. Once I ordered a medium rare bone-in ribeye and it was rare. BUT, it is still a nice and popular place! Friday night and weekend are super busy. Call them ahead to make reservations.",1
8833,"Amazing food as always
Service was great",1
8834,"The staff was VERY professional and on point.  I believe the manager, came to our table and checked on the service.  This was our first visit.  We were given containers for our food.",1
8835,"I eat here often. Good steaks and the price is quite reasonable. I can get a good steak meal for around 10-15 dollars. That's a hard match anywhere. I've never had poor service and all the servers I have had have been excellent.

I probably get the $12.99 10oz sirloin a couple of times per month. The place can be a bit loud, and hope you like, tolerate, or can ignore country music; but then again, it's a country styled place... What kind of environment would you expect?

Probably the most consistent food quality I've seen.

It's been years that I've been eating here, and even with price increases post COVID inflation, prices are still reasonable, and the food is just as consistent and good as ever.",1
8836,Was a 5 min wait to be seated. All staff very friendly! Top if off food absolutely delicious! My favorite restaurant! Just wish wasn't so expensive so I could go more often.,1
8837,"I didn't enjoy the service.  It was not service it was get your meal goodbye,  and  is everything I ordered here. "" Oh yeah, no problem "" Get home missing items. Call my driver back to take me again. Taking himr away from his time and family.  Ridiculous.
I know you don't care with the pandemic numbers being high and happy to have worker's , but at least find the ones who care about the consumers that spend with you.  As so not to dish extra funds for a simple meal. On a come back to get it right two times.
Amazing how much the owner responds to well said service.",0
8838,As always a fantastic place to eat. Never disappoints.,1
8839,Everything we ordered was amazing. Steaks cooked to perfection. The price was very fair. There is a decent wait but when your this popular of a place it's to be expected.,1
8840,Food was pretty good. I had the 3 piece catfish dinner with seasoned rice and green beans. I love their rolls and cinnamon butter. Autumn was great.,1
8841,the staff are always very nice and the steak is always cooked perfectly,1
8842,Went here a month ago no online waitlist 15-20 min wait at open time plus wait to be seated much rather go to Indiana than run a/c for half an hr waiting for call!,0
8843,Roadkill was the name of the dinner I got. Really good. Ask for 1/2 of the marshmallows 😊,1
8844,"The restaurant was full, Brad served me at the bar. From the moment I ordered to the moment I closed. He was not only gracious, he was absolutely a consummate professional. He wasn’t just taking orders, he was a 5 star host; catering to every patrons needs with total precision.

Texas Road House scored big with him. How lucky you guys are.  Wow, been a long time since I had service like this. Brad, I’ll be coming back because of you! You have a very bright future ahead!!! He should be your customer service trainer.",1
8845,Food is great. Stupid way they organize their pickups for take out is convoluted and borderline unacceptable.,0
8846,I don't usually write bad reviews.  However tonight we were treated very poorly at Texas Roadhouse Champaign Illinois.  I have a mother who is handicapped and does not get around well.  We went in to check on the wait and they said it would be 45 min.  We decided to wait and got Mom in the restaurant.   At that point they said we needed to go back out to the car and wait for them to page us.  I told them we wouldn't be staying then...too hard to get Mom in and out of the restaurant.  The hostess and her sidekick then became very disrespectful and told us sarcastically to have a nice night.  I asked if I should speak to her manager and she said No.  I own several tech companies and after this I believe I will put Texas Roadhouse on our no fly list....wouldn't want any of my employees to be embarrassed in front of customers or peers.,0
8847,"Great people, grand service, glorious food! Never fails without a doubt!",1
8848,Food was so good tonight. Katelyn/Kate was such a good waitress. She got us everything we asked for when and/or before we needed it.,1
8849,Service was prompt and polite.  The filet was amazing!!,1
8850,"My steak was a bit over cooked , I ordered it medium well, but to me it was over cooked, but they cooked me another one medium and it was perfect! Love those rolls!! They were very nice about it, my server ( Manny ) fixed it right for me and kept apologizing and I said that's ok. I will definitely be back!!😁😃. Different restaurants have their own way of cooking steaks,rare ,medium ,medium well and well. Overall it was very good,great!!",1
8851,Good food escort service just you if you've never been there go check it out you will be glad you did,1
8852,"Had dinner here tonight. We had a party of 4 for my friends birthday. Our waitress, Hannah, was outstanding! I wish I knew her last name so everyone could request her! She is beautiful, funny, quick and very professional! Kudos Hannah! Our food was phenomenal! Thanks for making my friends birthday great! Texas Road House rocks!",1
8853,"4 of us ate steaks, fried pickles, baked pots, vegetables and salads - all exceptionally good. The beer is good and cold. Our waitress was outstanding in every way. Very clean and efficient establishment with exceptional wait staff and tremendous steaks.  The background music is too loud. We almost had to shout to be heard across the table. I'm glad we stayed, but almost left before getting seated. My  wife (uses a cane) and I arrived earlier than the other couple, as they had been unavoidably detained. A young lady checked us in, told us where to sit while we waited. We waited for a good while, but the owner approached and curtly told us that to keep his efficiencies up, we must go outside to wait or to our car, even though there had been room for 6 to 10 other people to sit on the benches, where we were. I still don't understand what set him off.",1
8854,You've heard the hype well it's all true. From the food to the service it's all amazing. Quickly becoming my personal favorite restaurant. I get excited about every part of the meal. Make sure to call ahead to reserve.,1
8855,"The wait staff is often good here, even though there seems to be high turnover.  We eat here often. I love that they donate proceeds to various charities, or benefits.  We have a large family, and were recently told we cpuld not be seated, because our family was too big. They would not even place our family in adjoining booths or tables that were next to each other, even after speaking to the manager. Anything over 6 they refuse to accommodate now.  We will not bring our family back, even once they have ""returned to normal operation"".",0
8856,I ordered the medium rare 12oz Ft. Worth ribeye. Maybe the meat tasted a little bit too salty but overall the quality of the steak is still the best in town. Also the caesar salad is pretty good.,1
8857,"It was amazing! Our server was so friendly and mannerly and was on top of everything! One of the nicest and best servers we've ever had.. The food came out in a timely manner, and out of 4 steaks ordered every one was cooked as requested.  The food was awesome.",1
8858,"Had an awesome experience here. The food was great, hot and delicious. We will definitely be back. The Staff was very friendly and not overly pushy.",1
8859,Just a wonderful date night... really relaxed and had drinks and a meal.,1
8860,Always a great meal when I am there. Portion sizes are perfect and pricing is right where it should be. I never leave hungry or disappointed,1
8861,The food came out cold and it was 10 minutes before the replacement meal was brought out was brought out by that time my dinner companion companion was finished and was ready to go That being said The reason for coming out to dinner was to eat together Not 10 minutes apart,0
8862,"I’ll give this place 5 stars because the food and service is great as a guest. The people that work there do have a lot of basis to cover before they get out on the floor. However I will be honest in my opinion of how other servers specifically treat other employees is so unprofessional. Servers against servers and what not, to me it just seemed like another toxic place to work from what I could tell during my training period which I didn’t not finish due to this reason. It’s horrible and sad that people treat other coworkers with lack of respect and compassion. I guess that isn’t in their core values so it’s to be expected.",0
8863,"Great steak, good service. Had to wait an hour and 40 minites after checking in out in parking lot(covid precaution). Was worth the wait.
UPDATE
came back for dinner 2 weeks later, absolutely awful. Service was good but waited an hour after order. Waitress kept apologizing said she didn't know what was taking so long. MANAGERS AVOIDED OUR TABLE AT ALL COST. Checked on every table around us but ours. Steak had absolutely no taste fries with cheese were hard and cold like they had been sitting there. Would give negative numbers if possible and they were not very busy had several couples around us come order eat and leave before we got our food
I would think a manager would check on the table that had sat there for an hour and a half.",0
8864,"Food is always fantastic here. My steak may have been a little undercooked to how I ordered it and my dates a little over cooked but both slightly and not enough to be an issue. Our waitress Terri was awesome, she was very friendly and attentive and took great care of us.",1
8865,"Nice atmosphere, very nice food, nice personnel, decent prices.
Basically I cannot say anything bad about the place. It's not the different, heavenliest steakhouse you ll ever visit, but it's super good and delivers.",1
8866,hostess was extremely rude. it was raining hard and we had a disabled senior citizen with us and she could see this and told us to go back out to wait in the car.,0
8867,Very nice place with excellent customer service. I loved it!,1
8868,"It was great, we got right in. The flavor of my dish,roadkill, was perfect.I love the cinnamon butter for the buns was so good I thought I'd get too full. I definitely will be back and I highly recommend this place.",1
8869,"Dined in, and the food was A+! The onion blossom was delicious. The ribs were fall off the bone great, and the seasoned rice was spot on amazing. Great service! A++++ Please try Texas Roadhouse!😋🤌🏿👌🏿",1
8870,Don't want to jinx but don't think I've ever had a bad experience at any TR,1
8871,"Great food
Edit 8/18/22: Was disappointed. One of my favorites has been the Herb Crusted Chicken. We took our grandson for his birthday dinner. When we got our meal my chicken looked like it had been setting under the warming light too long. It was obviously wasn't very good. I should have sent it back, bit it was late and we needed to get home.",1
8872,"Not great.  Not bad.  Steak was tender and cooked as I requested.  Too salty.  Friendly staff.  Cumbersome wait-list process, but they're probably doing the best they can during Covid.  Reasonable prices.",1
8873,Had one of the best steaks ever today! Came out just a touch undercooked and I was worried about sending it back for fear it would come back overdone. The manager happened to  be walking past our table and was confident he knew how to make it perfect. 45 seconds and back off the grill was the recipe for perfection.!,1
8874,Our whole meal was perfect from salad to steaks and of course can't go wrong with their delicious rolls!,1
8875,"Great food, selection and service",1
8876,Always have great service! Customer service is excellent and so is the food.,1
8877,"Excellent establishment that is well-organized and responsive to their customer needs. Their app-ordering works very well. The system they have in place under pandemic protocol is very well set up considering it's ad-hoc. I believe this reflects on the excellent management team and staff training, not to mention their great teamwork. And oh by the way, their food always rocks!",1
8878,Food was delicious and good portions. We had excellent service!! We did have to wait in our car for around 40 minutes so be prepared for that..but the staff was friendly and very attentive!,1
8879,"Wait was about 35-40 minutes for a 2-top, which is about what is expected for Saturday night at any Texas Roadhouse, the text response on the waitlist is a nice update. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, our server Hannah was great and our order came out correctly and fast and Hannah hit the standard table touches. The manager also made sure to stop by our table before we left.",1
8880,Excellent food and service. The steak was sooo tender and one of the best I’ve had! We always love our occasional treat dinners to Texas Roadhouse 😊,1
8881,"First time at this location and it was tasty. Steak
wasnt ruined. Workers were all nice and polite.",1
8882,"Good service .good food.fair prices.sauce on boneless wings was a winner(hot )
Kept drinks full and gladly took our gift card🍔",1
8883,Food and service was very good. I have to eat my steak well done right now bc of pregnancy and it was nice that it was cooked through without being burnt to a crisp.,1
8884,"I love the 6oz. Sirloin meal for  $10.99 between 4:00 & 5:00. Certain days of the week. Check the website. I *believe* it is Monday thru Thursday.
I'm a born Yankee who is willing to let Texas secede - so I never expected to like this place (just for it's name alone) but they do great streaks and it operates like a week oiled machine. They get big crowds through every evening of the week! Very popular and now I'm a regular here.",1
8885,"Brad is a great server. We always sit at the bar area watch TV and eat. Good is hot, rolls warm, and steak cooked just right. The waitress even line dance. Great atmosphere for family.",1
8886,"Called to make a reservation for a birthday party of 12 people. I was Told I would have to speak to a manager for that large of a party and was put on hold.When the manager finally got on the phone he said an hour and a 1/2 wait , which I understood since it was a Friday evening, but he would  split us up in groups of 4 and sit us in 3 different sections. I explained to him this would not work as it is a birthday party and there will be kids with us.i explained that we had sit in the back before in a booth with a table next to us to accommodate our party.he states it is his restaurant and he doesn't do parties that way anymore. It  was absolutely ridiculous. We would have spent over $300 there tonight. I suggest corperate has a talk with this manager
His way is the wrong way for parties!!!",0
8887,"The service was good, the manager walked around to each table it seemed and asked how we were.  Food was decent.",1
8888,Great food and great service!,1
8889,"Great service delicious food family friendly. The servers here are always top notch. They never let your glass go dry and they tend to you even when the house is packed.
Love the atmosphere.",1
8890,"Excellent service, Hannah & Lyric were nice and attentive. The steak was cooked exactly to the requested level. My father and I enjoyed our visit.

Keep up the good work!!",1
8891,"Good food.  I have not found anything that I don't like yet.  Great people.  Hope you like line-dancing, loud birthday announcements and friendly staff!",1
8892,"I used to love the steaks.  Great flavor but the last 3 times no flavor and when I would go to pick it up, I make it a point to be earlier than when I am told to arrive, the food is cold.  I live 5 minutes away.  Today I tried to order on line numerous times, and it wouldn't go through. Very disappointing.  A favorite no more",0
8893,"Fun and energetic atmosphere. Friendly staff and not to long of a wait to be seated, or they offer to dine at the bar.",1
8894,"Food is great and staff and manager are friendly. I will say however that only a handful of staff wear masks and the manager does not wear one. Wearing a mask is a sign of respect for the older population and those more vulnerable to COVID. I'm not sure what the manager's name is, maybe he's the owner, but he's very friendly and helpful. It's sad to see that such a good manager (owner?) won't wear a mask or enforce the mask rules to his employees.",1
8895,"Service was amazing, the food was outstanding. Be ready for a wait in line though. Their food is just that good!",1
8896,"Food was great.
Came in with a party of 8 for Birthday celebration.
We knew we were going to be split between 2 tables, and ended up on completely opposite sides of the restaurant. Spoke to manager but he only apologized saying nothing he could do even though there were open seats next to each of our groups.
Totally unacceptable and very unprofessional.
Will never visit again.",0
8897,Food and service excellent. Grandpa had a great time!!✌💖,1
8898,"They are really set up for social distance seating. You check in outside and avoid a big line at the door. Service was quick , friendly and efficient. The food was delicious. I recommend the filet for the most tender steak. Loaded mash were delicious and the red sangria was great. Super experience.",1
8899,"This was my first time at a texas roadhouse. I ordered the porterhouse t-bone as medium-at the suggestion of our waiter, Nate. When it came out, Nate admitted it was more than medium. He said if I have any problem with it, let him know and he will get me another one. I hate complaining about my food. But after a few bites of tough chewing, I decided this would perhaps warrant a first complaint. I said something to Nate he was very apologetic and promised to get me a better one. The manager brought out the next one and it was right on. Juicy, tender and so delicious!  I will be going back!",1
8900,This was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant.  The server we had forgot my mushrooms and when I asked for them he brought me onions instead not once but twice. My wife's meal was completely cold and not cooked properly.  Then the owner came by and asked if there was anything that he could to help we explained the situation and he basically blew us off with just offering her a new potato.  What a joke.  We will never be back.,0
8901,There's a reason why there's always a wait.   Great food great service.  Pleasant atmosphere.  For a large restaurant to be full speaks volumes.  A+,1
8902,"Delicious pork chop and delectable rolls and sweet potato as usual! The atmosphere felt safe and welcoming! Service was not optimal. but when you say something, the servers work to make you happy.",1
8903,We have never been to the Champaign location. Our waitress Katie was the most wonderful wait staff i have ever had. She was so attentive to all details of our dinner. The food was very good and cooked awesome. Thank you Katie for your excellent service.,1
8904,"Seems to never fail, I ask for medium well and it comes out well done. For some reason my steaks have also been coming out really salty. New cook? Regardless,  it is a great place to sit and relax with friends and family. I love their salad they fix me (ice berg lettuce instead of the spring mix) and never make me feel like I am asking for their first born by the special order. I hope they get the steak issue under control,  but until then...they have other delicious items to choose from.",1
8905,Great food.  Great service,1
8906,Always friendly service and great food. I love that you wait in your car now.,1
8907,"It's  a place  I frequent  quite  often  at least  twice  a month  and other  occasions.  The food  is great. And the staff is to
I love the prime ribs and fish. Try them when u visit.  Oh and the chilly. Have a good  day .",1
8908,The service was excellent the food was excellent the pricing was totally excellent we had such a great time we went for my birthday,1
8909,"Had one of the greatest dining experiences of my life here. My server Philip was the best waiter I've ever had, I'll keep coming as long as he's there!",1
8910,"Placed a small online order and it took about 15 minutes longer than the time quoted on the website.  The staff didn't apologize and weren't very attentive.  In their defense they were quite busy, but sometimes even just a ""sorry about the wait, we'll have that out ASAP"" goes a long way to making customers feel like their business matters to a place.  No complaints about the food, just a little disappointed by the lackluster service.  I had placed a bigger tip than the recommended one online but the order itself was so small that it was a low $ amount, so I would have added some cash had the service been impressive.  Unfortunately it was not.",1
8911,The food was amazing our server was Soo nice and very attentive I will be taking my family back,1
8912,Came for our anniversary dinner. We both had steaks cooked to perfection! The call ahead feature is nice so the wait isn't as long!,1
8913,Great food. Favorite steakhouse,1
8914,2 months after covid restrictions have been lifted they still only restaurant in town using half their diining room and making people sit in their cars and not waiting room yet only employee in entire restaurant wearing a mask is the hostess so no clue why making people wait in car and only use half of dining room.,0
8915,"Service was great as usual, but was a little disappointed with the ribs. Kind of dry and definitely not fall off the bone. Could have been because we went to dinner so late.",1
8916,"This is a great representation of the Texas Roadhouse slogan ""Legendary Food, Legendary Service"". The food was great, everything we ordered we enjoyed, and the service was excellent as well! Our waitress made suggestions and was very attentive throughout our visit! All the employees were wearing mask and they had other COVID precautions in place such as handing out bagged peanuts in substitute of the normal peanut barrels found at this restaurant chain. We will definitely eat here again!",1
8917,Took my granddaughter here after watching her play with the marching Illini on Sunday. We only had to wait about 5 minutes to get seated. Addy was our server and she was very attentive.   We will be back when we visit the Granddaughter again,1
8918,"So disappointed, that management refused to let a 83 year old lady wait inside in air conditioning.  The outside waiting area was infested with flies and there were wasps. Had to walk back to our car to wait.  Management is unresponsive to their customers and inflexible.  Made our party with an elderly family member using a cane walk all the way to the back of the restaurant to sit at a terrible table by the restroom. When asked for a different table they refused until I said I would leave a bad review. We walked by many open tables on the way to the dreaded restroom table. They seated no one at the table by the restroom the whole time we were there. My advice is to stay away if you have an elderly member in you party. Management, please listen to your paying customers. You could have avoided this review by helping a customer with their two simple requests. Instead you chose to treat your  customer poorly. Shame on you. Food is Ok for an inexpensive restaurant.",0
8919,Very attentive server. Food was prepared as ordered except they didn't put mushrooms on the steak as I requested. They remedied the situation quickly and with an apology. Overall great food,1
8920,I just tried TR about a month ago for the first time. I have been hooked ever since. Their streaks are some of the best. I went to an upscale steakhouse and the steak was tough (even though it was med-rare) and no flavor. I couldn't wait to get to Texas Roadhouse to satisfy my steak craving!!! I went to this TR Justin was my server!!! I have to say he was impeccable. Very very nice and respectful. On point with refills and all of our meals were correct!!! I think he is a great asset to this establishment!!!! Kudos to Justin!!!!!!,1
8921,Amazing food! Amazing bread! Mind blowing service. I could totally eat there for the rest of my life! This place is usually packed so they also have a waiting room although on weekday I didn't have to wait. Surely have the bread with cinnamon butter to go and eat it the next day..it tastes 10X better!,1
8922,"Always love the steak from here. Almost the best, and the price is awesome!!! STILL GREAT",1
8923,"Great food, waitress was in training and trying very hard. Give them a chance to learn how to be great servers!",1
8924,"Ordered 2 rolls dozen online for pickup, arrived and where told we needed to come back in 30 mins closer to our pickup time (for pre-made rolls LMFAO) so we drive around and come back to get our order and its only 1 dozen, HALF of the order was missing, nobody answered the phone. Wish I paid card so I could dispute the charge, ended up leaving a voicemail for their customer service center.",0
8925,"Great food, great atmosphere, they even have vegetarian options, however limited! Definitely a great place for a get-together, but plan on spending a good penny!",1
8926,Service was not good at all. I got my meal and she forgot two of my idems. My meal also came out completely wrong as well. The waitress also did not give us refills. I also asked for more rolls from 2 different waitresses and neither of them brought them out to us. I think one the waitress was named Natalie and I am not sure who the other girl is but she has red hair. Both girls had an attitude the whole time.,0
8927,It would be nice if you could check in on the app like every other texas roadhouse. I travel alot for work and being able to do that makes it alot easier so you know ahead of time about how long of a wait it will be. Every time I come to this one there's no way to check in so I don't bother.,0
8928,"It was nice,  the steak was cooked perfect but I wish our server was having a better night. She seemed tired and didn't hear our order correctly but other than the server the food was excellent. Gave 3 stars because the price of the food we should of had better service and I had my three year old son with me and wasn't offered a booster seat and when we finally seen them we was done with our meal.",1
8929,My husband and I had our first experience here over the weekend. The place is clean and staff were very friendly. However we both didn't care for how loud it was in there. We couldn't even hear each other talking. The rolls are amazing.  Love those but they did mess both our steaks up.,0
8930,"Very busy place and there is a reason for that they do it right.
Clean, good atmosphere,  one of the most well run restaurants around with great team work. Bottom line on service is that it's truly impeccable.  Way it should be!
Menu is somewhat small but there is enough choices for everyone. Smaller menu makes it easier to manage.
My wife's salmon was excellent and my steak was cooked perfectly.
Little pricey but delicious and you get what you pay for.
We will be back",1
8931,We went in for my Mother's Birthday.  Jessica was our waitress... She was FANTASTIC!!! 🥰 THANK YOU for making her dinner SPECIAL! Oh and the food was good too 😂,1
8932,"4 year anniversary date night. Hubby was floored at how good it was. If you're looking for a quiet place to dine TRH is not a good choice. It's always busy, they love hootin' and hollerin' for a consumer's special day or event. Clean, great service, amazing food..we had Snake Bites, Awesome Bloosom, 6oz filet with shrimp, chicken tenders, chili , house salad, steak fries and loaded & sweet potato... do judge!!!- we were hungry, brought home lots of leftovers. 😁",1
8933,Cody W is an excellent server!! He knew the menu from front to back. Our order was perfect. Food and rolls were hot.  Didnt even have to ask for drink refills. Thanks for the great service Cody.,1
8934,"Pleasant, fun staff and great food!",1
8935,Made reservations for party of 13 for a birthday. Not seated together. Seated far apart on 3 different sections. Food was okay.,1
8936,The food is good but the wait is not right. Waited for 20 minutes and two groups who i heard them tell they would be added to the wait list got seated before us and we were already on the waitlist before them.,0
8937,"We always go after selling at the farmer's market, their steaks are the best. And a cup of chili is one of my favorite parts.",1
8938,"Normally a great place but this pandemic has truly taken it's toll on the quality of ""everything"" at this place. The food quality has slipped & the take out customer service is ""eh."" One really shouldn't have to hear about a servers extracurricular while waiting for them to finish before helping a patron(it's been done numerous times, on different days/times).  Their accuracy for orders, at least for me, has been sketchy, ie Brown Gravy instead of Cream & Corn instead of Brocolii to name a few.  I'm hoping in the very near future, they get back to their ""Awesome Food & Customer Service"" Pre-Pandemic.",1
8939,"Soooooo happy that this TX Roadhouse is as amazing as the one we love in Elizabethtown KY. My sirloin was perfectly cooked and so tender. The hubs’ prime rib was exceptional as well. Snake bites and rolls are always A+. Our server, Gracie, was the greatest too. We couldn’t finish our meal so she hooked us up with all the to go necessities, including rolls and drinks. 5 stars all the way!",1
8940,We had an excellent server. He was on top of everything we never waited or ran out of drinks or hot rolls. Very prompt on getting our check and getting us checked out. Best service I have had any where.,1
8941,This is NOT the place to go for party’s over 5.  The have NO concept of seating groups.  We had a party of ten we were told we had to split up and may or may not be seated together.  They took five of us back to a six top table the proceeded to take back six party’s while the remaining five of us waited.  There was a four top table RIGHT next to our first group and they took a party of two and sat them there.  It would have worked out perfectly for our group.  Then the Manager claimed Covid restrictions which the last I checked were lifted.  I’ll spend my money for large groups elsewhere that want the business,0
8942,Terrible to go service. They forgot 2 of my items and when i tried to call NO one picks up the phone. I called multiple times. This is not the first time I’ve had to call and no answer. It must be how they manage this location and it’s not right. The other items I did get were so bad we didn’t eat them. Everything was dried out like it sat for hours. The potato skins the fries the ribs. Nothing was edible. I don’t treat my kids to eat out much and then this is what we get. Money thrown away. We will not eat here again.,0
8943,"They've really nailed it with a comfortable pandemic atmosphere from text-based check-in to the partitions and clean tables. Felt really safe, though you now have to request the peanuts.",1
8944,Thier parking lot is very unorganized.   If The lady that is serpose to check you in did her job correctly  maybe it wouldn't be so bad. We waited an hr. Never received the text to go in. So we had to go back threw the check in lady. To find out she didn't even have us checked in.  And by  that time thier was no wait. Finally  ordered  got our food it couldn't even melt the cheese on my chili  the  rolls and service was the best part.  Plus this was  what i picked for my birthday dinner.   I will not be returning to the roadhouse.,0
8945,Steak is always good but for some reason I get the worst waitresses. I've always leave a good tip but still I don't always get good service. They don't have a tasty variety of sides so I gave a 3 star,1
8946,I ordered a curbside pick up today. They missed  one side (applesauce) from my Full Slab Ribs order that comes with two sides. Please check your bag carefully before you leave the parking lot.,0
8947,"This is my second time at the establishment. The first time I prefer a steak, mashed potatoes with melted cheese and a side of Mac and cheese. The steak was fine but the mash potatoes were cold with cold cheese on top and the Mac and cheese was not even edible. They just through something together. To add on 11/13 today I decided to give it a second chance because my girlfriend loves it so much. So I try again and no better the service was terrible I did not receive my blueberry lemonade drink, I asked for a extra sauce and croutons for my half of a salad I received. I never received any of those and this was multiple waiters and waitresses I asked. So I finally found one and she took the salad from me to make the corrections then never brought it back. So now I’m food less. They finally bring my order of steak out and it’s no we’re near medium rare but charred. I probably won’t give this another shot for a year I don’t even care to write review  but as a store manager my self I am appalled at the lack of guest service here .",0
8948,"Food has always been great, but they had a younger guy cooking the other day and our New York strips were a little dry and overcooked. We even ordered custom cuts of meat so we knew more than likely they were fresh. Our server was outstanding. Very attentive, not too pushy and very polite. even though our $48 worth of steak was a little overcooked, I will still definitely go back. I love Texas Roadhouse.",1
8949,"Horrible. Ordered to go, asked for my steaks to be well done, NO PINK. Well- clearly they don’t understand what no pink means. They forgot my rolls on top of that. So I called and was told they would refund my entire order back to my card, and I’m still waiting..... (Not my first issue with this place either, but I gave in, since it’s been over a year, and NEVER AGAIN)....",0
8950,Always good .  Cannot beat it! and those mashed potatoes omg the best.very consistent. The last three times the food has been okay just okay I didn't realize that when I just pulled up and ordered for carryout that it would take so long you said 20 minutes and it was 35 and she wasn't very nice about it at all the girl who brought the food out to me she didn't say sorry for the way thank you nothing just handing me my food and I was just like whatever I don't know if it was because I was in my junky car that she was rude or what her story was but I didn't appreciate her attitude whatsoever I have celebrated many many of my children's birthdays there and been there more times than I could ever count and the drive-thru that day was very disappointing and the food wasn't up to par it's just the truth will they go back yes but I really hope the food gets back on track,1
8951,We had just started our meal and the electricity went out . it got very hot  and smokey in there. we couldn't even finish our meal. (Even though we had to pay for it.) I have asthma and had to use my inhaler. No one came and ask if I was ok or explained to us what was going on.,0
8952,Terrible experience . Paid the bill with 2 gift cards we received as a Christmas gift ($25 and a $50) and cash that totalled $125.00 that we gave to our waitress with the bill only for her to return saying she only received 1 gift card for $25 and the $50 in cash. The $50 gift card we gave her was mysteriously missing. Nothing was done about it we were just out a $50 GC and about $30 in cash.,0
8953,"A take out for dinner. Always like it. Big steak and ribs! I like the free bread, not because of free, but the flavor and texture I wouldn’t have anywhere else, oh sorry, it should be we.",1
8954,They lost one of the two fifty dollar giftcards we gave them to pay for our meal. Said we only gave them one and they made us pay out of pocket for the meal. Got 93 dollars worth of food and somehow spent 125$.,0
8955,My loaded fries were do salty I could not eat them.  His steak was more medium instead of well done not a pleasant meal,0
8956,"Tried to order food at 8:56pm for a carry out and the answering service said they were closed. Apparently this establishment closes at 9pm not at 10pm like the website states, I am aware this could be covid curfew hours, however, the 10pm time was considered a confirmed time when searched.",0
8957,"The food was ""okay"".. but the insane wait times coupled with people stampeding over each other due to lack of space had my anxiety through the roof. Once seated I assumed the experience would improve, but the volume of music and lack of an organized seating plan made the meal uncomfortable and impossible to socialize over. Luckily our waitress was wonderful, which is why this review is 2 stars instead of 1. Go to Outback for comparable food and intact eardrums.",0
8958,We were forgotten in the waiting area. Slow service and my mothers coffee was cold when it arrived at the table. Another table across from us arrived after we did received their food and was finished before we even got ours. Mashed potatoes were cold upon arrival. Prime rib was excellent.,0
8959,"When did steak get so affordable? I'm still new to the steak scene, so don't take my word for it, but the cuts here are consistent and cooked to your fancy. Honestly, I just love this place for their bread and peanuts. THEIR BREAD IS AMAZING. And they have a ton of peanuts! Peanuts everywhere.

The meals are hearty and the sides are great as well. Don't hold back on asking for more bread, too! The servers are all enthusiastic, and I've had the pleasure of witnessing some kind of choreographed dance by a lot of servers that I'm still confused about. I was too distracted by the bread.",1
8960,"We have been to several Texas Roadhouse restaurants and this place so far has been the best. My Fiance and I walked in and was seated right away. This place was Busy. We ordered our drinks, appetizers and meal everything came out Hot and Fast! As always food was Delicious! Our waitress Lainey was Superb she was on point and very hospitable had my fiance laughing. We will be back again :) it is worth the 45 min drive",1
8961,I have never had a bad experience here. The food and service is always great.,1
8962,"The waiter was awesome. The best waiter I have ever had an any Texas Roadhouse... or any restaurant for that matter. He was training someone and they both were perfect. Literally no complaints. Wish I could remember the guys name. Food was perfection, as well.",1
8963,"The waitresses are nice and friendly, if you call ahead and reserve a spot, you'll almost immediately get seated. If not, the wait can be fairly long. The bread and butter is almost worth the trip alone, as they are both endless and delicious. The steaks are cook decently for a chain restaurant. Our orders for sides got mixed up and so while that made it slightly negative, they were quick to bring us corrected ones. The extras that they offer you when you order (like onions or mushrooms, etc) do cost more, so keep that in mind so that you're not surprised if you and a friend order the same, you get onions, he doesn't and you end up with a slightly higher bill.",1
8964,We always enjoy our meal at the Champaign IL location.  Foods always delicious servers are quick and check in with you often even when very busy.,1
8965,"Sometimes the food here is just not my style. But their Steak Kabob is fantastic. It's so good compared to everything else, it's the only thing I want to order here. Also the rolls and butter are the best. Always.",1
8966,Awesome. Great food and service,1
8967,"I went here with my family, and we all had a nice time. The restaurant was busy, but we didn't have to wait long to be seated. Our waitress was extremely attentive and offered helpful suggestions regarding what to order. The atmosphere was great - there was music, but it wasn't too loud. Overall, great food and great service. Would definitely come back to this location.",1
8968,The food was great but the waitress brought boxes immediately after we got our food.  I had not even tried all of my food yet. The boxes were in my way and I had to move them to be able to eat.  She brought the check like 5 minutes later. She was nice and said no rush but I definitely felt rushed.,1
8969,"We still had a long wait even though we called ahead. The wait staff was great, even with our large group. The steak and my side salad were great. My baked potato was seriously over cooked and extremely dry. My steak knife that was rolled in my napkin with my silverware was clearly dirty. It happens, so I'm not being too harsh.",1
8970,As per usual for Texas Roadhouse the service is absolutely fantastic. Our waitress Olivia was friendly and attentive. Always seem to come back to check on us at the right time and was very accommodating. The food was excellent and the steaks cooked just right. Will definitely come back again.,1
8971,We had an Amazing experience!! Our wait time was 5 to 15 minutes we didn't even have to wait 5 minutes. Our waitress Jill was phenomenal she is the perfect example of an excellent waitress. She offend checked in with us and she happily answered all of our questioned. We also noticed that the rest of the staff were doing an excellent job as well. The atmosphere was fantastic and very clean as well. If your ever in the area it is the place to go. I would HIGHLY recommend it. We also wanted to make sure that the management was aware of how well their staff strived to make our experience the best experience possible. Thank you all for doing such a wonderful job! We will be back the next time we are traveling through the area.,1
8972,"We called ahead an hour before and walked in and went straight to a table, no waiting. Our waitress was extremely friendly and made us feel right at home. We ordered and maybe waited 5 minutes before our food was brought to us. Texas roadhouse has 20 or more staff member constantly checking on tables and also I noticed that they do a thorough job cleaning up, even saw on wipe down the inside of the lamp shape. The food was super high quality and tasted amazing, some of the best steak I've had. When the manager heard this was our first visit, she brought us a bag of goodies and coupons and hoped that we enjoyed ourselves, can't believe how good the service was. Will definitely be coming back at every chance.",1
8973,"Food is always good, but half the time I go for pickup, I'm told to wait in X spot, wait there for 10-15 minutes, and have to call to find out where my food is. Turns out the booth told me to go to one spot, but told the server to deliver to another. So half the time I end up with cold food due to their miscommunication, and lack of follow up on their end. Reconsidering other options",0
8974,"Service & waitress was great! MY STEAK, A RIBEYE 10 OZ HAD TO BE REDONE 3 TIMES!!! Medium well...set out 2 steaks that we're burnt & well done!  I couldn't believe it! The Assistant Manager was very nice! I believe that we should have received free meals cause it was a special occasion & my friend was his first time being there & kinda left him disappointed!",1
8975,"Texas Roadhouse has always been a fine eatery. The food is affordable, and made to order. I recommend the Sirloin personally, but their chicken is also very good, and I also enjoy their salmon. Their staff is always polite and willing to help and accommodate you in any way they can.

With the world being in the state that it is, they also take measures to guarantee the safety of their employees and customers. Waiting in your car until you're told to come inside, plexiglass dividers on booths, peanuts in bags to grab at the check-in desk, and the removal of physical menus, switching to digital menus so people won't spread germs are what really grab your attention when you come back for the first time since quarantine. And if you're still unsure about eating indoors, then order your food to go and you'll be able to enjoy your favorites at home.",1
8976,"Fine prime rib. They happened to be out of sweet potatoes. This was on par with the typical chain steakhouse. Crowded and busy, a but noisy with conversations and families.  The wait was short and they accommodated a table request.  The greeters/hosts very friendly and polite.",1
8977,"Not good. Three steaks ordered, all three came wrong. One sent back and then took twenty minutes to be replaced and when it came it was like rubber.

The manager did reimburse a good part of the bill which was a welcome gesture but would have preferred a good steak.",1
8978,This place doesn't even deserve one star. Manager is rude and waitresses are rude. If you have more than six people in your party they will not seat you together even when there are plenty of tables and they were not reserved. If I were you I'd eat elsewhere otherwise you'll have the worst experience.,0
8979,"Our waitress, Taylor, did an amazing job.  We couldn't rave enough about the quality of her service.  As it turns out the manager said it was her first night alone.  Wow!! This restaurant has an excellent Covid accommodation plan.",1
8980,"Probably the best restaurant in the Midwest overall. Texas is all about flavors and that is why I love it so much. The quality steaks and the prices are unbeatable. I eat there almost every week, and I am always satisfied.",1
8981,"The rolls were really good as usual. My meat was not cooked like I like it. Couldn't get my waitresses attention, so I just didn't eat. It was my son's birthday and he picked there or I would of walked out and went somewhere else.😡",1
8982,"Customer service was terrible. Employee Luna was very rude to me. And my takeout order came with no silverware, steak sauce, or butter sauce even though I was given two bags of dry rolls. 0/10 experience",0
8983,"Hands down, the best ribs you’ll find in “chain restaurant.” Most of the menu is delicious and constantly great service keeps us coming back.",1
8984,"***** I have eaten here twice in the past 8 days! YES, it is that GOOD! I always get the same steak thick cut New York Strip (Med. Rare) and 99% of the time it’s cooked perfectly! If it isn’t (which rarely happens) they will always make me a New steak! I also get two baked potatoes and a lot of the waiters/waitresses will automatically have one wrapped for me to go without me having to ask! The next day I will have my 2nd baked potato and a couple of their melt in your mouth rolls w/ their signature butter for my lunch! This is so easy for me to make and that’s a plus as I am disabled and don’t do a lot of cooking for myself! My disabilities are not easily seen so these waiters/waitresses are going “above and beyond” for the sole purpose of giving good service! Not just because I’m a disabled person...
OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE is an awesome thing to have in this world right now!
THANK-YOU TEXAS ROADHOUSE and ALL of your amazing employees! *****",1
8985,The waitress we had went out of her way with everyone to make them happy. She was tipped very well because she was so awesome. I left a note on her receipt! Well done management!! You did good!!!!!,1
8986,"I came here Friday 10/30/2020 around 9:30pm, wearing a ""Keep America Great"" hat. I only say that so if someone in management sees this say maybe can find out who my server was and give her praise, despite where I was and what I was wearing, I.E. the hat, she was very nice and respecting and did her job perfect. We even talked about the lockdowns for a minute and she mentioned the restaurant was shutting down due to c o v I d, ....
So when going out to eat, well now for this location picking up only, remember that these guys, and girls are working less and making less, some not working at all so try and be positive.

THE FOOD,
The food was great, loved the Ribeye steak!! Doesn't matter if its from a location in south Mississippi or middle of Illinois, it always taste amazing!!
I do though wish they could figure out a way, when serving the cheese fries if they could maybe pour the cheese on after putting the bacon on the fries, that way when eating them the bacon doesn't just fall off...
The salad (Caesar salad ) was very good, just only had two croutons ... I'm not upset, just being transparent.
Sweet tea was pretty good, I would say most people would love it, I just am very picky when it comes to my sweet tea, being from the south and all.
Would I come here again? Absolutely !!",1
8987,I waited almost an hour for a roadkill steak & trust me they named it right because that's just how it looks never going to that place again. I was told my food was just sitting there for awhile. My steak was cold I didn't bother going back in to wait an an additional 30 minutes no thanks. It's simple I just won't return to a place where they serve you something that I wouldn't serve a dog so sad dining out isn't the same anymore. Pay for the high price meal to get garbage because that's what I did with the food threw it in the garbage. Obviously they don't know what fresh is🤔,0
8988,"Just thinking about their awesome salads and steaks is making my mouth water.  If you don't mind crowds, and loud, this is the place for you!  Be smart and put your name on their waiting list so that you don't have to sit and wait for a table, they get crazy busy, and for a good reason!  They have the best tasting steaks in town.",1
8989,Today we went out for a date and needed to wait about 30 minutesfor a table which is fine. Once we got there we were asked what we wanted to drink and given those. I even asked for a specialty drink which came out about 3 minutes after I ordered it. Then we ordered food the wait for that was about 45 minutes. We had a very attentive waitress who asked me if I wanted another specialty drink and made sure my hubby had a full soda. After about 30 minutes the head waitress came over and let us know that the machine ate our ticket and it would be a bit longer before we got our food. The manager came over and brought our food and asked us to check the food to make sure that it was cooked to our like and it was. The food overall was good and hot. And the staff are wonderful I definitely recommend this place.,1
8990,"We have gone here a few times and the steak is always good. The service is usually fast, even on the weekends and the fresh bread is awesome! I think the butter makes it tho so be sure to get an extra cup of it. Gift cards are available and there is a bar. They have margaritas with ""kickers"".",1
8991,"Rolls and salad were excellent, as always
Pork and steak were very moist and cooked as ordered. Our server was excellent.",1
8992,"It was an extremely busy Saturday afternoon they were on a long wait. However, my husband and I got immediate seating at the bar. We had an awesome server/ bartender who never stopped smiling. Food was delicious as always. Love this place!",1
8993,Best steakhouse in the US!!! Highly recommond the bread and the bone in rebye.,1
8994,"We wanted to try their curbside pickup last night for our Mothers Day meal so we tried calling in our order and the automated message referred us to their website and app to order. Downloaded the app and placed our order at 6:20. Time to pick up was 6:45. We got in the long line at 6:30 and was instructed to go to a designated number to get order. Many sacks of food came out to many hungry people but ours did not even after they asked our name. Finally we flagged down a deliverer and asked why it was taking so long, we had been there for 45 min. Mysteriously our food then arrived with no apologies for the delay. It was lukewarm and had been sitting around for sometime. Hope they get their act together! We love their food, but will not go  back until we can sit inside!!!",0
8995,"If you eat here, i recommend dining inside. To go service is terrible. Almost everything was wrong with my order and its really disappointing because i dont have issues when dining in. Smh
I wonder if it was just me or all to go customers today",0
8996,"I literally arrived 1 minute before closing on a weekday. I was greeted warmly and welcomed. Kitchen was notified and my order was taken with a smile. The steak was a bit charred but still tasty. Unfortunately, their tasty bread rolls were all done for the evening, but I was able to get 1 order to make little steak sliders for the road that night. This is my favorite roadway stop every time we drive down to Florida from Chicago.",1
8997,"Great food ,great service thank you to our server Jess she was exceptional! !!",1
8998,"We had six people in our party. They were slow, got the orders mixed up, and forgot some of the items.  Our waiter was very quick and took very little time to listen, and was slow to respond.  My ribeye steak was fatty.  No consideration was given on our bill for these issues.  Next time we go somewhere else.",0
8999,Great food! Great atmosphere! Reasonably priced has become our favorite place to go for special occasions.,1
9000,Tasty food is a must for any restaurant and good service only enhances the flavor. Allison was our server offering food and drink suggestions for party of 4.   Her follow up with us just right not to little not to much.,1
9001,"Was very good but I had them take my 8 oz steak back because it was very well done and I wanted Med well ,,, they brought my newly cooked steak back and it was half the size that I had given them .. I called the waitress back and told her what was going on and I wanted the difference taken off the billing .  Even though they did this my meal was ruined. I had ate my baked potatoe  and green beans while they were cooking my new steak or it all would have gotten cold ..  I just say,, watch for the switch !",1
9002,We go here 2 or 3 times a month and it is usually great food and service.  But tonight we had horrible service and we got our salads after the entrées were brought out!,0
9003,Delicious ayce free rolls!!,1
9004,Worst restaurant experience ive ever had. Horrible service. Food sucked. The manager Scott has no idea how to run a restaurant and the owner Jeff obviously can care less if his customers are satisfied or not. Will not be going back,0
9005,Service is some of the best you will ever experience. They always have plenty of staff. The food is always cooked perfectly. Portions are generous. Price is appropriate.  The bar is decent. They have a lot of TVs to watch sports. Plenty of parking.,1
9006,"The first time my wife and i''s good came both steaks were cooked incorrectly. After sending them back I asked for another beer and was brought something completely different than what I was drinking (shiner bock). When out good returned my wife's foods was correct, but my steak was still not right and they forgot one of my sides. The manager came to talk to me. The man was polite while I explained the situation. In the end I didn't have to pay for my food or the incorrect beer.",1
9007,"Food was very warm,  salad was crisp, food very tasty. All we have come to expect! Thank you for for a great birthday dinner!",1
9008,"Delicious food, great atmosphere, fantastic wait staff. The only thing I would change is the margarine spread they use for the baked potato and I wasn't crazy about the cinnamon ""butter"" for the rolls. I would prefer real butter. It tastes better.",1
9009,"I ordered a bone in rib eye, the second most expensive steak. It was charred on the outside completely and too much fat. Second, it must have been cooked cold since the center was still uncooked. The top shelf long islands tasted like lemonade, not a cocktail whatsoever. The only upside was good service and decently cooked broccoli. Not impressed...",0
9010,Nothing to write home about. Very busy and the service shows. Steaks were pretty good. Really try to get you in and out quickly.,1
9011,"My beautiful family and I ate dinner here last night. There was 10 of us, 5 adults and 5 children. The Manger was awesome!! He actually brought our bread and plates to us. He gave us the most amazing waitress! Plus the manager gave us a discount on our bill, which was more than $180.00. Thank you all very much for the awesome service!",1
9012,"Always exceptional, exceeds expectations every time. Delicious food, staff is crazy courteous, and bill is always LESS than expected!!! Never a disappointment! You will always take some home.",1
9013,Great food and great staff,1
9014,If you can get past the rude and disrespectful hostesses the food and wait staff were wonderful. Since first impressions are what will keep me in the restaurant I would not have stayed. The manager did get me seated after complaining about a 30 minute wait to be seated in a half full restaurant. There apparently was not a server that could handle seven diners. Even though food was great and server was excellent I probably won't be back.,0
9015,My favorite place to eat. I enjoy the delicious (all you can eat) rolls and peanuts before the tasty meal. Nice place to take loved one for birthdays. They make it an enjoyable experience by giving a big yeeha while having them sit on the saddle. I also  enjoy the line dance employs do every so often. Fun and tasty place to go!,1
9016,This was my first time here and I was not impressed. I ordered my food online around 5pm and was given a 7:30pm pick up time. I didn't end up getting my food until after 8pm and my steak was cold and tough.,0
9017,Ribeye and shrimp.  Both were perfectly cooked.  Waitress was attentive and friendly.  It was very busy but they had a ton of people working so apparently management knows what they are doing.  Everything was pretty much perfect,1
9018,I’ve had Tucker as a server twice now and he was on it! I came in already expecting slower service and refills being a busy Saturday night but I was pleasantly surprised. My steak is always cook to perfection as well. Keep it up!,1
9019,"Always very tasty! Those warm rolls and cinnamon butter hit the spot and the steak was perfectly cooked. Chili was piping hot and also had a great flavor! Thanks for a fun night, y'all!",1
9020,It had been raining roof leaked where seated and told waitress tried not to get dripped on but did not move another table said same. I guess food good but did not enjoy experience,0
9021,"If you make a reservation for more than 5 people do not expect them to be able to accommodate you with anything that resembles comfortable seating. You will be crammed into a corner and if your lucky the people around you wont mind you sitting on top of them. The food is always good, the staff, management aside is friendly but the seating is ridiculous. We did call ahead seating for 7 (which included a highchair and a sling for my infant) and when we got there they tried to seat us at a table for 6 and wanted to stick my toddler in the isle. We told them that wouldn't work and so we had to go back to the waiting area for them to find more reasonable and safe accommodations for our party. They then took us to a table for 4 (because that makes sense) and pulled out an extension and put the high chair in the middle of the isle once again. I am not an unreasonable person but when the seating is so crammed together that your only option is to put my toddler in the middle of a busy walkway, that is not acceptable.  We soon realized that they were simply incapable of seating us somewhere  that made ANY logical sens we left but not before i asked to speak to a manager who got irrationally  defensive. Anyway, we will not be going back, not because of the food or  the staff but because the restaurant layout was thought up by someone who has never been in a  restaurant before.",0
9022,I am from Chicago and I love my steak 🥩 🏘️ and my favorite 🥩 🏠 there is Madison's but the Texas roadhouse is the best plus the deal 9.99 was a blessing for me Madison's don't even offer good food for this price and great service ..,1
9023,Lady said 1:30-145 hour wait and after going in to plug in my phone after waiting for an hour I was asked to leave and wait outside and was told there was still an hour wait after already waiting for an hour. Very snotty worker at the front and overall a horrible experience we left to eat somewhere else so please save your time and go somewhere else.,0
9024,"The food was great, large portions and the staff is super friendly and courteous. I said to one employee that this was my first visit and she brought me out a coupon for a free app and a bag of peanuts. Excellent service.",1
9025,"Very loud atmosphere! Hard to communicate with family. Seating had to be at 2 tables? Noise...Seems to put children in an active state to not sit still?
Overly spiced food. Long waits for service and food. Not a good value or experience for eating out or celebrating someone’s birthday. Sad!
I needed ear plugs before my food came. Music was so loud and therefore everyone had to speak loudly.",0
9026,"We have always been fans of Texas Roadhouse, and the one here in Champaign is good. They tend to cook Their steaks a little more than what you ask, so I always ask for more rare than what I actually want. They have a great staff and are good at handling the busy times. Their takeout service is great too, they've never gotten my order wrong and it's super fast.",1
9027,"This place was PACKED! Our party of 5 was seated in less than 10 minutes. All the orders were correct and the food was delicious. And they placed us by a picture of my childhood hero, Dale Earnhardt. Winning!",1
9028,"Besides the burnt ribs and the mashed potatoes always being horrible and the shrimp is apparently spicy and small in numbers which they don't inform you of, the waiters and waitresses have always had a great attitude and friendly vibes coming from them and they service you like family. Their big steak is a bit salty but nothing a dabbing from a napkin can't solve and they are decently affordable. I have never spent 100 dollars here and yes I tip and yes that is including the tip so if you have 70 bucks and there's two of you this place has great food is decently affordable and make sure you tell them with every order you don't like horse radish if you don't like it, Trust me.",1
9029,"Traditional steakhouse fare served here.
The food here is always good. Never have had a bad meal yet.
Love the rolls and cinnamon butter!
Large dining room, perfect for larger groups if required.",1
9030,"I generally used to like this location but this last visit may be my very last. At the very least it'll be quite a long time before I return. First I'll begin with the server. He obviously was not having a good night and didn't want to be there. He consistently got drink orders wrong and had to retake our order because he 'forgot' what people at our table of four ordered. When our food was brought to us there was something wrong on 3 out of four of them. Now, we'll get started on whoever was in charge of the kitchen for letting meals go out the way they did to tables. Food was delivered to two at our table a good 15 minutes before the others received theirs, this should never happen.  I've worked at a kitchen as a cook/chef/manager for over 20 years and food like this should never leave the kitchen like this. My steak, ordered well done arrived in a pool of blood at no more than mid rare. When everyone else at the table had nearly finished eating I finally received my steak. Well done in a microwave. I've seen it happen, and I know a microwaved steak when I see one. Drink orders continued to be delivered wrong. When we were given the check the server tossed it at us into the peanut bucket without uttering a word. The only reason I give two stars because our appetizers were good and sides were semi decent. And the shift leader who checked on us at the end genuinely listened to our issues, seemed concerned and thoroughly apologized, giving us some coupons. But to be honest it just doesn't cut it. There needs to be proper training across the board because it's painfully obvious that no one there cared about their job last night. The wait staff didn't care one shred and the kitchen is completely incompetent. There were so many other issues that night but I simply cannot list them all.",0
9031,"I have been to this Champaign location now three times since the re opening after Covid and they have failed to seat me, my husband and our 6 children all 3 times. Our kids are all 11 and under. They told us they could only allow two tables of 4 at each table. We don’t have this issue at any other restaurant in Champaign Urbana. We went to a Texas Roadhouse  in Springfield Il and were seated all together with 0 issues. Not sure what this Texas Roadhouses issue is but needless to say our money went to other business- ones of which will let me and my husband both sit with our  children to have a dinner.",0
9032,Have been to Texas Roadhouse many times. Normally traveling 45 miles north just to have dinner there. Always a great steak and good service. I did notice the excellent rolls have gotten smaller the last visit though. :(,1
9033,Wow!  We had an amazing night.  The food was excellent and our server was the best(EMRA-we love you)!  Needed a good dinner and good atmosphere after the long day we had and found it here.,1
9034,"Four words: cinnamon butter on rolls.
Okay, I'll say more words... They also have delicious steaks (mmm sometimes it'll be cooked to right level sometimes they just level you up) and good sides. I recommend checking out their early dine menu by 6 pm, M-Th.",1
9035,Always good! Wait staff is wonderful. I've never had a bad experience here,1
9036,"Good first Texas Roadhouse experience. The server was polite and personable. The kitchen messed up my order, but she caught it right away. Other the kitchen mess up, the food was flavorful and abundant",1
9037,"It's a chain so pretty standard, the service is good and enthusiastic, they give you peanuts which is fun since you can throw the shells on the floor, the apple cinnamon butter is really yummy with the rolls. The portions are pretty HUGE but I went small and thoroughly enjoyed the 6oz filet with broccoli and potatoes and it was perfect.",1
9038,My steak wasnt cooked as i wanted it so after our server talked the manager he/she took my entire meal off our ticket. The server was great and very friendly (Tks Steve). Ill definitely go back but never again to the Outback.,1
9039,Always enjoy their ribeye steak with baked potato and steamed broccoli. Along with a endless supply of hot rolls with cinnamon butter a perfect match. Even on a busy night they are quite fast at getting family's fed in a timely manner without rushing anyone. Staff are super friendly and on top of this game,1
9040,The food was delicious. Specially the bread 😀,1
9041,Wait staff is always very friendly very good prices for what you get which is great food,1
9042,The steak is great. The only thing is to remember asking for the steak sauce. Otherwise they won’t give it to you. I think they should give it to me without asking though. I have to say the to go is not as good as dine-in in the past.,1
9043,"Wait was long. Not very accommodating for large groups. Food took forever to get once ordered. Couple of the steaks were undercooked. When brought back, they were overcooked. They said they'd give an extra serving of sweet potatoes to make up for it, but never did. When asked if get discount for poorly cooked steak, said no. Had to request horseradish sauce 5 times (not including when I actually ordered it) before I actually got it.",1
9044,Steaks are always cooked to the perfect temp. The wait can be kind of long but that’s because it is so good.,1
9045,Great food. Fast and friendly wait staff.,1
9046,"Ordered a 12 oz Ribeye medium rare. Came out. Well done. Talked to management, they said they would cook a new one for me. By the time it came out my friends had all finished eating. Manager asked me to cut open the steak, it’s even worse than the first one. They didn’t charge me for it, but I didn’t ever get to enjoy the steak I wanted.",0
9047,"Service and food was top notch. My steak was cook perfectly, and the sweet potato came right out of the skin.",1
9048,This is a great place for delicious steaks and ribs. They have daily specials for early dining and each Wednesday they offer a $9.99 steak special. I use their app for call ahead seating and usually have no wait even if it’s busy.,1
9049,"Got really fast seating this night. Great wait staff. Food was pretty good. My steak was a little tough, but everything else great. A little noisy though.",1
9050,"Love this place! My favorite steak place in Champaign. It is reasonable and there is a special on Wednesday night and also one other night I believe. There is no where that can match their rolls, I could go just for them. Its usually crowded and waits around dinner time, sometimes lengthy if you do not do call ahead seating. Call ahead seating is not a reservation that can be set far in advance. The margaritas are awesome also.",1
9051,Food was delicious and our server did a wonderful job even though they were crazy busy.,1
9052,I have not been to the Texas Roadhouse for a long time when I decided to come out one night the service was fantastic and the food was so yummy! The price was well worth it and my steak was cooked perfectly and their yummy rolls are the best in town!!!  I could just come back just for the rolls I wish I know how to make those kind of rolls they have. I love the honey sweet butter melts in your mouth... I will come back  for sure! This is my favorite steak house in Champaign!  Great  service and FOOD!  Great relaxing place to go eat and relax!  :-),1
9053,"The steaks are actually pretty solid for a chain though sometimes too over seasoned. They do get medium rare right mostly and know how to get decent char on it.
Free peanuts and rolls with cinnamon butter are their gimmicks, and they are actually enjoyable.
We've only tried few menu items other than steaks since they're mostly standard chain fares. They're at least decent.
Sure, I can make better steaks at home with better cuts of beef, but sometimes you just don't feel like breaking out your grill. And it really is a pretty good place to take the family out for dinner. It also has more or less the best steaks you can get in town, unfortunately because high end restaurant scene in this town is just garbage.",1
9054,O my my. What a birthday disappointment. Ordered a steak and when it came it out it was cold. So when it came back out...the whole order came back out. Mind ya I ate the broccoli and rolls. Steak was not tender...but they compt the dinner. Not really what a birthday is supposed to be. Very very disappointed on their food!,0
9055,The chicken fried with chicken gravy was great. Enjoy the server Nate and the manger was also great. Atmosphere was wonderful and I went on a Tuesday and the food was great. Not my first time going and it sure won't be my last,1
9056,"I'm only giving a 4 because you ran out of Ribs & that's what my mom and daughter wanted, other than that our dinner was great. Our server Greg was fabulous he did an excellent job very attentive. Thank you for the great service",1
9057,"Texas Roadhouse used to be my favorite restaurant until last night, now i promise I will NEVER be back! Went into eat with my son, it was 10 minutes till 11:00 they close at 11:00 when we got there we were seated and asked if we would like a drink, we both ordered a drink and 2 minutes later a little bald guy comes over and tells us that we can't have a drink because he doesn't feel comfortable serving us!!! I couldn't believe it we had both had 2 beers prior to going to Texas roadhouse and were not anywhere near intoxicated , Im sure the only reason  he "" didn't feel comfortable "" is because it was 10 minutes till closing and he didn't want to stay for us!! I am 54 years old and have never been cut off from drinking anywhere!!!  It's obvious that they don't care about my business or they would not have been so quick to offend me! So if it's close to closing time this is definitely not the place to go, website says they are open till 11:00 but really they mean 10:00!!",0
9058,Very busy. Once seated we had our meal quite fast. Steaks were excellent and cooked just right. Now I see why they're so popular.,1
9059,The food was ok.... I have had better but the wait time was crazy and dont call to see how long its going to be just a waste of time but is u have some time to kill after 5 pm then this might be for u but get there early,0
9060,"The waitress was very quick and very responsive. The food quality was very good, though their Buffalo sauce is not so good!",1
9061,"Our visit started out good, good waitress and service. But when the food came one of our steaks was over cooked, we got a new one and it was still mooing. But we had a good waitress and an amazing manager.",1
9062,"Food was good and plenty of it.  The meat, fries and green beans were too salty for my taste, I am on a low salt diet.  The music was too loud, so the people around was talked louder.  Visiting with our dining partners, was very difficult to hear them.",1
9063,Average slightly higher end cookie cutter restaurant/bar.  Did not get what I ordered.  Commented to waiter (musta been 16 yo). Nothing was done. It’s a busy place & noisy. Not for romantic dating.  Good place to bring the little ones,1
9064,"Can't say enough good things about Texas Road House. Love the rolls, great steaks. Our #1 choice for a great meal.",1
9065,The food was excellent like always. Our wait wasn't the long considering it was after 8 on a Saturday night. But our waitress Brittany was in a odd mood thats what puzzled me first she was nice then throughout the meal when i asked for xtra sauce or refill on my beverage she was really rude and pissed off. Very weird. And purposely blowing pass the table when we were trying to flag her down for something. I will go back for the food. But not have her as my waitress,1
9066,This place is Amazing I at here on Valentine’s day with my Family everything was delicious the service was great overall  I will continue to come back ❤️Thanks so much to the nice Waitress .well job done Texas Roadhouse.,1
9067,Was an hour wait but we'll worth it. 14 Oz steak cooked perfectly.,1
9068,"Service was terrible, steak was nothing but fat and cook manager refused to cook my son a new one. This was a birthday outing meal that our twins do every year....and, was a nightmare for one of my twins!! Must be under new management, because they sure in the hell don't know what they're doing...not to mention that ruined my kids birthday!! Will be notifying Corporate!!",0
9069,"Awesome food, awesome service! I love Champaigns Roadhouse! Always a good time.",1
9070,"Great friendly waitress she was amazing.  I had the ribeye and it was terrible,  my wife had the filet mignon and it was terrible, daughter has cheeseburger same thing, son had the pulled and it was okay, other sin had sirloin and it was amazing.  In there defense it's the very 1st bad experience we've ever had and we go to Texas roadhouse a couple times a month. They we're accommodating and tried to make it right but we were to full from the awesome rolls.",1
9071,"I have never gotten a bad meal here. When we're in Champaign we eat here as often as we can. The food is great and at a fair price. We try the call ahead seating when ever possible, that saves a lot of time. I hate to wait to eat so this is the best way to get right in.",1
9072,"Very great food but always crowded. You almost seemed rushed to leave but that's not the case. In the middle of eating, you will receive your check, but that's ""customary"". The food will make you keep going back. Many servers are also very lively!",1
9073,"I enjoy the food at Texas Roadhouse and the ability to pick my own steak means I can almost always get a good steak for a good price. That being said, the service is abysmal. Being a frequent customer in the past, I've noticed they have a very high turnover rate in their personnel and the waiters/waitresses seem to be extremely apathetic and serving customers is far from the front of their mind.",0
9074,"I recommend starting with the rattle snake bites. If you join the text group. You can get a free appetizer.
Bread is delicious and there are a lot of great choices. The early lunch deal is a good option to fill up and not spend as much.",1
9075,The outside check in booth was so convenient and our wait time was short.   Great service and excellent food as always.,1
9076,Food was great. Service was great. Just had to wait a really long time. Otherwise super good!,1
9077,"I love this place. The bread & cinnamon butter, I could eat as a meal! Everything on the menu is fantastic!! Be back soon!",1
9078,"Following is an email that I sent to Texas Road House after a recent attempt to eat there.   Normally I am a very easygoing person but I feel the need to inform you about the handling of my call ahead seating experience on December 8th at your Champaign, IL restaurant.  We had family in from out of town and had a party of 15 that we wanted to take to dinner.  We phoned ahead to let them know how many people we had in our party and what time we would arrive at the restaurant.  During the attempt to arrange the dinner we were somehow hung up on twice.  Once we were able to get the information relayed to the restaurant, after the third call, we thought that we were good to go.  There was no mention of any seating arrangements made by the person we spoke to.  When we arrived 15 minutes before the scheduled time and checked in with the number they gave us(5005) we were informed that we would be seated at three separate booths as they became available but that they would not be able to seat us near each other.  When I asked to speak to the Manager about it I was told that this was just the way it is.  I felt that the staff was very rude when I asked why I was not told that this would be the case when I had called several hours in advance.  They merely insisted that I should have spoken with a manager at the time of the call and that they would not accommodate us being seated together and even seated another group of 6 at a table that was very close to the first table they tried seating 5 of our party at.  I found this experience to be very unprofessionally handled, and disappointing.  Even though this has been our go to Steak Restaurant for a few years, I doubt that we will ever eat at Texas Road House again and that when asked we will send people somewhere else after telling them what happened to us and how it was handled.  I will say that we were able to call one of your competitors (Longhorn Steakhouse) in the same city(Champaign, IL) and after explaining the situation to them they were happy to have our business and were able to accommodate seating us within 15 minutes of our arrival.  I spent $289.00 at that other restaurant which include a $40 tip for the wait staff who did an outstanding job. I will be writing Longhorn Steakhouse an outstanding review.  One of the Texas Road House owners did call and apologize but did not offer any way to make it up to us.  We may go back there with a small group but I'm not sure that is going to happen.",0
9079,Had a Kennys Cooler adult beverage with the kicker. It was very strong! I feel i got my moneys worth. They never let us run out of bread! The waitress was very nice and pretty too! Defiantly will return here!,1
9080,"Bad service.

I understand that when I arrived they were busy but I say for more than 5 minutes and 2aw never acknowledged, given a menu or offered water. A gentleman walked up and was greeted immediately. When I said something the bartender was apologetic, but then everyone at the bar wanted to come to her defense and say ""she has been slammed. Cut her some slack."" Bartending 101...do a visual survey of your bar to see who the new faces are. Being busy IS NOT AN EXCUSE to skip over a customer.",0
9081,"We always have great food and great service when dining in, as well as carry-out. We also appreciate how kid friendly the menu/dining atmosphere is.

Highly recommend the red sangria. Very good!",1
9082,Normal Texas Roadhouse experience - lots of loud talking and music.  The ribeye was done as ordered.  Because we had a large group (11) two wait staff tended our needs.  Service was a little slow but not bad for a Sunday afternoon.,1
9083,Amazing family fun place to have a nice sit down meal. Waitstaff is always friendly and very punctual no matter the time of day weather they are busy or slow. Extreamly happy with the food and I will be returning soon...,1
9084,"Good service, very friendly and polite waitress.",1
9085,"I have never had a bad experience, no matter which Texas Roadhouse I go to in any state. The staff are friendly and attentive. And, the steak is always perfect. Highly recommend",1
9086,"I ordered t bone steak , no flavor, disappointed. This is my first visit and last. Service is good.",0
9087,"There was amazing food, service and communication. Overall everything was good",1
9088,Today Texas Roadhouse honored veterans by providing a free lunch to them.  The restaurant was so full but the staff handled this very efficiently.  The food and service was wonderful.  Thank you Roadhouse for giving our Vets a special thank you!,1
9089,"If you want the best steak in Champaign, this would be the place.  Go (very) early to avoid the line of people flocking here.  Excellent A+ marinated steaks and decent beer selection.  Friendly service.  Just, be prepared because it can get a bit loud (some call it fun).  If that doesn't sound like your type of atmosphere, you can grab your meal to go - trust me, it's worth it.",1
9090,"Can't get enough of the carbs in this restaurant! This bread is Dangerously addicting. I can honestly eat this bread and butter everyday, which is why I go to Texas Roadhouse like once a year!  The salmon is my ""go to"" and I'm usually satisfied. Wait staff was equally friendly but could tighten up on their timing and getting back to customers during delays.",1
9091,It's a fast food steak house that has the best rolls this side of the Mississippi. The food is good for the price and they have peanuts for you to snack on while you wait. So if you have a peanut allergic I would skip this restaurant.,1
9092,"They must keep all the good beef in Texas because the porterhouse I got was garbage

2nd time in row that my dog ended up eating most of  my steak

Didn't have enough sour cream for the baked potato

Barely any butter for the rolls

Don't order to go because it's obvious nobody is running quality control",0
9093,Wonderful food and service! I appreciate their efforts to accommodate us as a large party. The steak is always well seasoned and cooked just the way I like it.,1
9094,"Our go to steak joint locally. Pro tip: Call ahead and reserve your spot before you get there. Especially on weekend evenings. Great, fun staff, and always good food.",1
9095,"I'm usually not a big fan of chain restaurants but this Texas Roadhouse in particular is top notch. Great service, steaks are cook to the correct temperature, and the customer areas are clean.",1
9096,"The wait was minimal, our server was friendly and our food was great! Consistent!",1
9097,The steak here is consistently great quality and is usually cooked right.  It is seasoned a little more than I would prefer but it isn't enough to be an issue.  Get it smothered with jack cheese and grilled onions (or shrooms if you like that kinda thing). The chilli is fairly classic and really good.,1
9098,"I was with a group of 9 women to celebrate a birthday on Wednesday night. We were there about 6:15-6:30pm. The birthday gal only asked for a table for 8 and said a booth would be ok having no idea how squished 8 healthy sized women would be let alone 9.  The waitress started taking orders and stopped when when the birthday girl asked if we could move to a bigger table as there was no room for arms, purses, food. We were told by the manager it would be 30-40 minutes. Then a booth catawampus to us was opening and we asked if a couple women could move there and were told no. We were expecting 2 more people yet. All told we had no one taking drink orders or bringing rolls for a good 30 min until I went up and said something to the woman manager. She said that on the ones who had already ordered, she was pretty sure our food was up even though some late arrivals had not even been able to order drinks yet. Turns out she was wrong. In the meantime the booth across from us was opening and she finally said we could have that. Then that table finally got service before even our waitress came back. We did not get our food until after 8pm. Ridiculous. Then to top it off my friend Trish who was my driver had to leave so we got our tickets and walked up to the waitress station. I gave our waitress s $3 tip and then handed her my $19.89 bill/ticket and a $20 bill and told her to keep the change. She said thank you. My friend then paid with her credit card so she got a receipt. I did not. We heard later that our waitress claimed she was missing 1 payment!! SOOOO ticked. I think she forgot to ring up my payment, the only other explanation is she pocketed my $20 with her tips. Soooo disappointed.  I was told that the manager eventually told the remaining group not to worry about it they would figure it out later but I am still ticked that this happened. Put suspicion of wrongdoing on any one of us. And my friend and I were long gone by time we heard of all this so could not defend ourselves. We were in the room just east of the entrance, south booth against the wall. Look out for that waitress and be sure if you pay cash you get a receipt!",1
9099,We were in town from Maryland and wanted to surprise family for a birthday. We arrived almost an hour before our expected party and the manager proceeded to inform us that they would not handle a party of 15. So we took our party to Outback who was more than accommodating and were well deserving of our business.,0
9100,Grilled Chicken Salad..... The Best 😁,1
9101,"Ordered Texas Roadhouse family dinner tonigjt. Pulled pork, huge salad, 4 individual sides and those delicious rolls for $24.99. Ordered around 5:45 and it was ready for pick up at 6:20. The meal was delicious and we have enougj leftovers for tomorrow. We will definitely get it again.",1
9102,Service was good but food was nasty and over cooked!! To many steakhouses to come back here where the last time food was good but aervice sucked!! So we wont be back!! Took 3 months before i can back was hoping to have a different outcome however still not happy overall!!,0
9103,"Golly, Best Prime Rib I'd had in quite some time, and was very surprised to see that the green beans where garden fresh and not canned. The rolls and butter where DELISHIOUS. I WILL be returning soon.
Prices were very fair.",1
9104,Ribeyes were absolutely perfect tonight,1
9105,2 drink did not even ask for it. He gave us one before we was done with the first. He keep on walking by see if we needed any thing i gave him a good tip. Every thing came to us fast and hot,1
9106,We had Great Steaks here! My wife said her porterhouse steak was the best she'd ever had.  I had the Fillet medallions and my son had the Rib-eye.  All were great.,1
9107,Very lively. Good for families with kids and young and old people. Sincere and joyfull wooden waiting lounge. Creative way of eating free peanuts and throwing the shells to the floor. Kids like it a lot and drawing chalk pictures to the floor.,1
9108,A good joint with fair price to enjoy time with family. Waiters were great and the food arrived fast. I would give the food 4/5 but in overall I liked the experience.,1
9109,Vegetable options are limited. Broccoli isn't cooked. Green beans are more of a southern style with no alternative. Salads have fresh vegetable pieces that make it hard to chew for some persons. Meats are awesome if available... And the music is Loud!,1
9110,"Website doesn’t allow you to order, app doesn’t allow you to order, called and rings for 15 mins (twice) with no one answering. Probably a good indication of how their service and quality of food will be anymore.",0
9111,Delicious steak and great service!,1
9112,"I travel alot but Champaign is my home. For the past 4 weeks I have traveled to a different city for work. At least once during each of the weeks, I have gone to a Texas Roadhouse for dinner. I kept going back because of the quality cut of steak.  I like, the 20 oz ribeye, medium rare. I actually was looking forward today in going to my local location for the same steak. The steak tonight was low quality compared to other steaks I've had  at other Texas Roadhouses. Low quality in that it was super fatty and poorly seasoned. I compare this steak to getting the steak on clearance at the grocery store because it is too fatty and hard to sale. To top it off my wife's NY strip was fatty too.

Customer service was good. Quality of steaks were bad.",0
9113,Overall a great experience! My server was kind and friendly and made my visit very enjoyable! Thank you Phil!,1
9114,"Everything was great!!! The food, service, and atmosphere. If you like green beans you have to order them, they are to die for. Best I've ever had!",1
9115,"I had the beef tips with mashed potatoes again, my favorite, very good. 😋",1
9116,"We had a great time! Our waitress was super duper sweet, pleasant, well mannered and nice!! The food was good!!",1
9117,I loved it the food was so good and the waiter's were so nice even though it took forever it was worth the wait definitely coming again!!!,1
9118,"I've always loved how you can eat peanuts and just throw the shells on the ground. Their Wednesday special is very popular so there can be a wait. Their early dinner specials are good as well. When it's your birthday, they have you sit on a houses saddle, the service gets every bodies attention and after announcing your birthday everyone who is willing yells a big yee haa. The prices are fair as well especially for a steak place. Parking can be hard when it's busy as well. I'll still return :)",1
9119,"Matthew did a great job, above and beyond. All 8 meals were great. Drinks kept full, rolls offered frequently, steak on point. Great job!",1
9120,"I brought my $30,000 instrument, and the restaurant would not accommodate me at all. This has never happened to me at any location that I have ever brought my instrument too. They seated us at a table where , and then made us move for their own reasons. The new table was across from a baby, and they told me that I was causing danger to the baby by having my instrument there and offered to put it in a public corner where cookies it was just been stolen. After much negotiation they agreed to put it in a locked office but would not let me bring it there myself. I showed someone exactly how to carry it and left them to move it to the office. When I want to get it back, I have someone else carry it back and did not follow the instructions I had given them to ensure my instruments safely. They did not apologize nor make any efforts to accommodate my needs. I would not recommend attending this restaurant.",0
9121,Cassie was our waiter. She is a real gem. Best waiter we have EVER had here. This resteraunt should be proud to have her. Hope we get her as our wsiter again.,1
9122,would love to order online but past week cant add my gift cards and cant get through on the phone. ridiculous,0
9123,"Placed an order to go for another family. When picking it up It was quick, easy and all the foods the correct temperatures when delivered. Great way to give a night off to yourself, or surprise someone else. Very inexpensive.",1
9124,Horrible check in...have to drive to booth..check in...they text...that was all fine...told us 15-20 min wait for party of 2...great...wait..wait..wait...35mins goes by...so I go inside ask how much longer...they tell me will be another 40-45mins....really...lol...come up with a better system.,0
9125,"This is one of the best Texas Roadhouse resturants we have been in! Clean, good service, food was great, not extremely loud. We could actually have a conversation! Probably won6 be in thebarea again, but if we are-we will stop again.",1
9126,"Busiest place around for a reason. Food always comes out as expected. Good prices, good food, no complaints.",1
9127,"Large menu with lots of options, even some that aren't *too* terrible when trying to watch calories. The salmon is great, but the steamed vegetables are pretty blah and disappointing even if you want a healthy option. Just splurge for a better side if you want to actually enjoy your meal, haha!
The ribs are good if you like trashy chain restaurant ribs (proper bbq ribs shouldn't ""fall off the bone"" like a roast; they should be tender-firm, like a steak). The steaks are delish, as is the chicken. Haven't tried the burgers, but I've been told they're good.",1
9128,"Always a good time,  and great customer service",1
9129,"Sirloin hit and miss on tenderness, but when it's right it's fantastica. Delicious rolls and nice selection of sides. They must be doing something right cause the place is always packed, swamped, jammed even busy.",1
9130,Waited 25 minutes for a to go order. I finally flagged an employee to inquire about my order. When I received the food it was COLD. I was very unhappy with way it was handled. It will be a minute before I return.,0
9131,The food is always good. The wait was long but well worth it.,1
9132,"First time I have been there, I was blown away with the wonderful service recived  and they were busy!!!  great appetizers and meal my steak, was perfect!😁🤩",1
9133,"Food was excellent but on a Saturday night, call ahead and make a reservation or expect to wait 30-60 minutes for a table.  Service was outstanding.",1
9134,Very polite people take care of you and when you are sitting down at the table they make sure you feel at home,1
9135,"The food here is great, if you don't mind how loud and obnoxious it can be. I could do without the waitresses coming out and dancing around, has a tendency to ruin an appetite.",1
9136,"Great service, food, and atmosphere.  Prices are ok but they have great specials.  Wish there were more in my town because the place is packed open til closing time.",1
9137,Since the pand. the service has really taken a nose dive! They seem to cater to carry out customers and service to the dine in customers is abissmal! Be long time b4 i go again.,1
9138,Favorite place to eat in Champaign. Never seem to have any issues here. Sometimes it’s a long wait but it’s to be expected and most people should honestly know this by now.,1
9139,I love it  I take my mom and my wife and my wife uncle's wedding there,1
9140,Very disappointed in the waiting policy. No reason to make patrons wait in cars. The Covid hoax is over.,0
9141,"Food so good, you can almost smell it looking at the pictures....LOL",1
9142,"Great food, excellent service any problems they take care of it right away. Love coming here price food and service you can't beat it.",1
9143,"Can't believe I had one of the best cooked salmon steaks in a good while, but I did! Then they also honored my Veteran's ID for a discount!",1
9144,Cody our server was absolutely wonderful. He was extremely positive knowledgeable and funny. He was willing to talk to us even though it was busy. I was very impressed!,1
9145,Very good service once we got sat down. Always good food served!,1
9146,I've been here many times. I've had issues with their service but those aren't going to stop me from giving them a high score. I love the food here.,1
9147,"Our waitress, Ali, was outstanding!",1
9148,"Unfortunately this was our worst experience at Texas roadhouse. We had poor service, and had to send our food back. I hate to put this on here because it's always a 5 star, but I am really disappointed 😔",0
9149,We had a large group on a very busy night and they did an awesome job at accommodating us. The service was good and food was great!,1
9150,"Texas Roadhouse was great!! The food was awesome, and our waitress' was Drew. She was very professional and friendly.  I will go back next time I'm in Illinois.",1
9151,Fantastic food and fantastic service! We also had a free appetizer.,1
9152,"Decent food that's just slightly too expensive for what it is, but they have enough dishes available to please everyone that isn't vegan. Took off a star because this location is absurdly slam packed constantly and there isn't enough room for the people waiting. You end up being packed in like cattle.",1
9153,"Went there before it closes by few minutes. They refused to take the order for my entire party who came after me directly. Were so rude in talking to me. I was a regular customer, but I am not coming here anymore.",0
9154,"The popularity of Texas Roadhouse makes it a hassle to get into on the weekends and makes the service and food take a long time but that's expected. I enjoy the skinny lime margaritas, the steakhouse salad and, the roadkill especially. They do bring a basket of rolls to your table to enjoy while you wait.",1
9155,"Very busy that day but we were seated quickly! Food arrived in a timely manner, was done perfectly, and as always, delicious!! Wait staff were friendly and attentive!!",1
9156,"The food was EXCELLENT, great customer service and generous portions.  The ambience was great as well.  A little pricey but worth it for special occasions.  Definitely will visit in the near future.",1
9157,The steak was not prepared as ordered on my pick up but still wasn't to red to eat it was medium rare.,1
9158,"Good steak for a modest price, the best rolls in the world, and chicken strips so good you actually eat the leftovers. The noise can be a problem for those who are sensitive.",1
9159,"Amazing food and all the people that work there are so genuinely nice, it was our first time there and we can’t wait to go back",1
9160,"Love this place food is great, wait staff great, but I  suggest you call ahead for your table had to wait ask hour. It was packed from the time we got there til we left.",1
9161,"Great atmosphere, Great food, Great Service = Great experience.  It was a little on the higher side as far as price goes, but I think it was well worth it considering the quality and professionalism put into every aspect of the dining experience.",1
9162,the food was outstanding ! steak was just right nice and tender with the sautéed mushrooms on it. the shrimp was delicious and bread was nice and warm. Beer was nice and cold. service was out of this world.,1
9163,"Love eating here, and they now have outdoor dining during Illinois phase 3 mandate. Food is excellent, portions are good, prices are reasonable.",1
9164,Very nice people for a very large group,1
9165,Love this place. Food is always great. Service is awesome. The only bad thing I would say is that the music is way too loud.,1
9166,"After being told of 20 minute wait that turned to almost 40, my family and I had to thread through jam-packed waiting lines. Coupled with waitresses and waiters arguing over who goes to which table and themselves trying to get through the jammed areas, turned into a nightmare. That was not safe for anyone trying to be seated or get to a restroom. Not going back to this place.",0
9167,"So so good. Food is always on point, service is great even when they are super busy and packed which is almost always. Prices reasonable and drinks are delicious! Free peanuts don't hurt either 😉",1
9168,"While the wait can get extreme at times, Texas Roadhouse is AWESOME. The bread they give you is delicious, and the food is outstanding. You will not leave here feeling hungry.",1
9169,Hubby and I split a 16 oz. Prime Rib dinner and still had leftovers!  Cooked to perfection!  Service was great too!  Thank you!,1

9178,Fast service and great food,1
9179,Still ome of the most consistent steak houses I know. Steaks and ribs are well seasoned and cook right almost everytime. They put alot of high end steak houses to shame sometimes. Plus they have awesome sides. Always a go-to steakhouse.,1

9181,Probably the best western style chain of steak houses in the country!  Consistently good food!,1

9200,best restaurant in champaign.  Brad is the best!,1
9201,"Great food, but soooooo loud. Can't really carry on good conversations because of the volume of the music + people. Is a very popular restaurant because the food really is very good.",1
9202,"Wow is this place busy! Even so, we got seated quickly and the service was excellent. Food was good too.",1
9203,Went there to celebrate my birthday yesterday and wow Tyler was frickin smooth as hell and they sung happy birthday to me 🎂🎊🎉,1
9204,Never a bad steak. They could turn the music down a little bit though. Very difficult to be able to carry a conversation. I'm not THAT old to need to complain about such a thing.,1
9205,Take out was terrible. Didnt get my food until 15 minutes AFTER I was to pick it up. Got home and our meat was rare rather than medium well. No offer to discount or make any other provisions.,0
9206,"The prime rib was so good! We both ordered it and I recieved an end cut, which i was more than happy to recieve! So tender and flavorful.",1
9207,Best rolls and steaks.,1

My favorite place to eat in Champaign now that Red Lobster has priced itself out of reason!",1
9214,"We waited more than 35' for the foods for 3ppl and we ordered just 3 dishes. It was a rainy day and Monday, no special games, not crowded. One of my side was missing. No drink refilled.",1
9215,Good food and quick service. Price is right. Missed 5 stars because they are loud (all Texas Roadhouses are) and the Cubs game wasn't on.,1
9216,"Well, great food and service but this place could wake the dead.  I hate how loud the music is and add in the crowd and the result us that I do not go except when i am forced.",1
9217,Went early to get a table for 9.. wouldn't seat us until everyone was present.. even though I let them know they where 10 minutes out... Wanted to order appetizers before everyone arrived... Seated us at two different tables.. Manager stood behind our table the entire time talking in a very loud voice so we couldn't even have a conversation... Without trying to talk over him...we have eaten at this location multiple times and have always enjoyed it.... Never seen this guy before and don't think I'll stay if I see him the next time....,0
9218,Always fast and friendly service. Love this place i just wish it opened at 11 every day lol,1
9219,"Friendly service, delicious food, Texas Roadhouse is a rock star! My particular favorite is the prime rib! Give it a shot and you won't regret it'",1
9220,Great time! Did you know they line dance in there?!?! I have them the standing ovation they deserved! WHOOP! I decided to get the bloody biggest steak they had....and it was .....wait for it.....LEGENDARY!,1
9221,"Food excellent

9224,"Always greeted with a smile, prompt delivery of our food, alcoholic beverages are NOT watered down & the location manager goes around & thanks everyone for thier patronage. How's that for customer service.",1
9225,Great dining experience,1
9226,"I have eaten in a Texas Roadhouse in many states and find them to be very consistent in the quality of the food (outstanding) and service. The one in Champaign, IL is a fine example of what a great place they are to choose for a meal.",1
9227,"Very good, very good service from our waiter. They were crazy busy and it was still good. That can't be said for 90% of the restaurants in Champaign-Urbana.",1
9228,We waited an hour and 45 minutes to get a table. Once we finally got seated our waiter was fabulous and the food was wonderful but there is no restaurant or food worth almost a two hour wait!,0
9229,"Great food and service. This place is always packed and niosy, but everything else more than makes up for those flaws.",1
9230,Consistently top quality food and service. It's well run and the steaks are always cooked just the way you order them.,1
9231,Tonight everything was overcooked. The rice was old & cold. My steak was supposed to be rare and it was barely pink. Neither the rice nor the meat seemed to have been seasoned. Disappointed this time.,0
9232,Good food and good service.  They are set up for covid with curbside pickup which was a bit confusing but a good setup once we figured it out.,1
9233,Had bone in rib eye! It was fantastic! Cooked like I asked and tasted great! As always rolls and butter out of this world too.,1
9234,Management is always amazing more than accommodating service wise little disappointing I do I do believe his name is Steven but other than that I'm really not too impressed with the service and I'm not a cheap Tipper you get what you pay for and I've had some snarky waitresses lately servers whatever food still great Foods always great never changes one of my favorite restaurants in Champaign I love it,1
9235,"'Legendary food, legendary service""? Oh please. Don't flatter yourself  glorified Applebees.  You'd think they pay the workers more for saying 'legendary' as many times as possible while serving mediocre food:/",0
9236,The food here is delicious everytime and the staff is amazing!,1
9237,"Mediocre at best. I've been to a number of texas road houses across this country when i was a truck driver and I've had way better. They didn't let my boyfriend pick out his steak, which every other one let him do. The waitress and manager admitted that the macaroni is kraft macaroni and said that all texas road houses serve this macaroni and cheese which i know for a fact isn't true. The ribs were over cooked and we had to wait forever for simple things like refills. The people in this town are missing out on a REAL Texas Road House experience.",0
9238,"It was good, but the ""Road Kill"" tasted more like a burger than actual steak. The baked potato and chilli was very good, but I legit thought it was a burger",1
9239,The food is maybe good but the service is so slow. However the waiter that served as (Mathew) was a great person,0
9240,The Road Kill is very tasty.,1
9241,This is my #1 favorite place to eat. The food is awesome and so is the service.,1
9242,Love this place. My steaks are always cooked to my order. The salads are cool and crisp.,1
9243,"Good food, service is good too. But it is so loud in there you can hardly gave a conversation at your table.",1
9244,Started with a hair in our rolls. Food under seasoned and bland. Granddaughter 6th birthday so I didn't cause a scene.,0
9245,"I'm bias against Texas Roadhouse, but the rolls are good. One was normal for a Texas Roadhouse. If you are a fan of the franchise, you will enjoy it. If you are not, don't expect the place to boost you opinion of them.",1
9246,"Dinner was ok, steak was over cooked
Waitress offered to tell cook but after waiting 40 minutes to get my food,Told
Her I would just eat it,Had things to due",1
9247,Go here every summer when i visit family here in Champaign.  Got to get there early. Food is excellent. Service is a little slow but understandable because its packed. Will go here twice this week before i leave. Prices are very resonsble.,1
9248,Took almost an hour to get our food and when we did three of the five orders were wrong. Extremely expensive yet mediocre. Not how I remembered it being years ago.,0
9249,Amazing food and atmosphere. The wait staff is very friendly and professional. I would highly recommend this place to anyone asking.,1
9250,People say that the bread is amazing but I think it's just fine... the steak is OK. But I do like the peanuts.. crowded even during weekdays.,1
9251,No wait even though it was busy. Food was tasty. Drinks were great too. Great service,1
9252,Rib sauce needs flavor,1
9253,The food and staff are always awesome. Be prepared for a wait on the weekends and it can get pretty noisy in there.,1
9254,"Always good food load music and service is great for fast food sitting down! Always nice servers, hard workers!",1
9255,I love the food but the dining experiencing is lacking. The music and atmosphere is too loud and here is almost always at least a 15 minute to an hour wait.,1

Love this place",1
9257,"Amazing atmosphere,food and staff. Really all that needs to be said, AWESOME. Wait times can get high on weekends",1

9259,The server was amazing. The food was even better. Will definitely visit this location again.,1
9260,The Food was Amazing..,1
9261,"Loud, but it's a Texas Roadhouse, so going that should be expected. The food you get is wayyyyyy more than a normal person could ever finish in one setting. Recommend the Bloomin' Onion.",1
9262,I usually love their food but I've had bad service and overcooked steaks AND POTATOES (?!?) the last two times I've gone,1
9263,"Every single time we have been here, the food is excellent,  steaks done to perfection, and the best margaritas.  Love this place.",1
9264,"Crowded, BUT, that's for a good reason, Great food, friendly people, all around FANTABLOUS",1

9274,Terrible online ordering system. It's been processing credit card for 40 minutes now. Can't even refresh the webpage anymore; just kinda stuck/crashed.,0
9275,The service is typically very fast and not too nosey. It's good steakhouse food and remains very consistent.,1

9300,You can't get better service or food anywhere else but Texas Roadhouse Champaign. Jeff and his team are amazing and we will forever be customers!,1
9301,"Need to watch the busboys. You eat there alone, go to bathroom, come back and your food and all is gone. Management teaches them to clear tables too fast and not observe.
Lots of changeover in mgmnt too.",1
9302,"This is by far my favorite restaurant! Best steaks , good salads , very friendly staff , multiple tv's for sports....I could go on and on!",1
9303,Great food boy drinks are way too expensive,1
9304,Always a good value. Since the music volume is down more enjoyable. Glad the dancing ended. It was sexist and degrading.,1
9305,Hands down the best Steaks in town. I've tried all of them in C-U and Roadhouse makes consistently the best steaks around,1
9306,Staff was horribly rude especially since they tried to sit 5 grown adults and 2 kids at a tiny table when we had a wheelchair. They finally moved us but not until after we were treated rudely.,0
